He started sending me pictures of knives and threatening me with them. Then one day we had a really bad aurgement over a boy making me uncomfortable. He started getting really mad calling me names, showing my knives, telling me to shut up or fuck off. I left him alone for abit to cool off, then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I got a text from him saying \"im so sorry about what happened babe. To make it up to you. Ill come meet you.\" I was suspicious but forgot about it soon. I met him at a local shop near my house. I saw him, I ran up to him and went to hug him. Then I realised he had a knife in his hand. He pressed it up against my back and said \"better fucking behave\" I immediately froze. I was terrified. We got on a bus back to his house it was a large house but not very large. His room was painted a beige colour and he had a desk next to his bed and a window. He pushed me up against thr bed. Pinned my hands above my head against the wall. N started taking our clothes off. I started kicking. Really hard. And he got more and more pissed and proceeded to molest me. I can remember a pain in my stomach and back. And can remember blood everywhere. I cried. And cried. And cried. He held me and fell asleep when he was done. I manged to get off him without waking him up and jumping out the window. I still had like 20 quid on me so I ran to the bus stop n caught a bus back home.",

He had a job to do at his cousin's house, and I was left to play with her secondary-school age son. At some point he convinced me to climb under his bed and help him with his homework. He then put a thermometer inside my vagina. I don't recall much about it, but know that he told me it should be a secret. The second instance was during my early teens, my second year of secondary school. I used to get off the bus at my grans house and stay with her until my mum got home. I would usually either go and sit in the kitchen or front room and watch telly. I don't remember the details of how it came about but I think it started that I'd always go and give my grandad a kiss on the cheek as a greeting when I came in, and he must have turned his face towards me one day. Eventually, it became that I would sit next to him on the sofa and he would kiss me inappropriately for minutes at a time. I don't remember when or why it stopped, but I just remember being glad it had. I felt so confused, was he cheating on my gran? I was only 12. I let both of these memories pass in to the distant memories of my early life as I had clearly decided to not report the behaviours so couldn't see any point in hashing it up in my mind. I didn't realise that I should have sought help for the mental repercussions, as I feel these two instances are the reason that I spent my teenage years putting myself in increasingly dangerous situations and having sex with strangers, being taken advantage of and being abused by men who took my lack of no to be a yes. I am now a stable, settled 30 year old and am married with two children and my husband is the kindest, most respectful and caring man you could meet. I am one of the lucky ones.

From sexual conquest lists to being treated like objects of sexual desires we have faced many obstacles throughout. When reported to the staff the biggest consequence given was a verbal warning. Even though we all sat through a briefing at the start of the university year about how sexual harassment was not tolerated in the navy and that it would be instant dismissal. The staff wonder why we don't take welfare issues to them, but how can we if we don't feel like our voices can be heard. One incidence [date omitted to preserve anonymity] a major perpetrator of the sexual harassment was promoted into a position of leadership. One of the very people we are meant to go to when we have an issue. The staff even found what he did funny, Our commanding officer even referring to his sexual conquest list as his \"ultimate orgy list\". A member of staff once made me feel as though I hadn't earned my place in my unit fairly and suggested that my bruises were not from an obstacle course that I had just done but because I had a boyfriend. Repeatedly making comments similar to this even once I had made it clear that it was making me uncomfortable. I have faced multiple sexual harassment comments made by people who have previously been on verbal warnings.

The whole issue is perpetuated by the boys club in the leadership team. They just want to protect themselves. When it came out that a large percentage of the girls in the unit were unhappy and had complained we all received messages from the boys about how they felt they had done nothing wrong and why hadn't we told them before. When we had all tried on so many occasions. The fact that the person in charge of welfare [date omitted to preserve anonymity] was part of the 'boys club' only made the issue worse.

        "body": "I was emotionally, financially and physically vulnerable at the time - at 15 my father had been jailed, our house, money and belongings repossessed and trying to carry on with education and life while hiding this situation from the small middle class white community we lived in and already felt alienated from. My mother who had not worked for +20yrs was also found guilty in the court case, while doing her court ordered community service hours she struggled to get a paid job to help provide for the household, claiming benefits and always counting her pennies; we were all trying our best to make ends meet and build a stable life again. At the time, I aspired to be a doctor just like some of the richest and smartest family members I had, and so pursued as much work experience and volunteering as I could. I joined a local disabled charity, one that ran weekly activities and summer camps for disabled children. All the volunteers were around my age and up to mid 20s, with the managers being from mid 20s to 40s. I was successful in the interview process and was onboarded into an establishment I could not have imagined existed given it is a charity with a mission to provide life-long support to the local disabled community. There was a clear position of power for the managers and leaders in their mid 20s, both directly and indirectly - in working conditions they were the boss, in social positions they would openly discuss the female volunteers sexually and compare us. On numerous occasions, 3 of the leaders leveraged settings like 1:1 car shares, 1:1 tasks that were away from the group, and after-work drinks to sexually harass and eventually sexually assault me which is the story I want to share. One of the leaders had been giving me a lot of attention - one on one I would receive flattery, kind words, sometimes tasteful jokes, but in group settings would find ways to make me feel small, weak and ugly amongst the other volunteers. Without realising, I was being groomed to yearn for his validation and make him happy; this went on 5days a week for 2months. Nearing the end of the summer camp, us volunteers and leaders were helping prepare the charity building for renovation - clearing out items and putting rubbish in skips, I was 16 and couldn't drive, so as per his information, I told my mother to pick me up at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. As [date omitted to preserve anonymity] approached, the volunteers and leaders started grabbing their belongings and said their goodbyes, I called out to one of the leaders and said \"where's everyone going? [name omitted to preserve anonymity] told me we're finishing at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]\". That leader laughed and said \"no, we finish at [date omitted to preserve anonymity] but maybe he has something for you to do\", gave a smirk to two of the older boys and left with everyone. I wanted to text my mother to tell her to pick me up as soon as she can, it was only me and [name omitted to preserve anonymity] in the building, but he told me not to, gave me comforting words that he just wanted to spend some time with me without everyone getting in the way. He began touching my body. He described what he loved about my body, how he found me attractive and how much he liked me and began kissing my neck and then my lips, and pulled me into, what was, the soft play area. I said to him I felt uncomfortable, I felt weird and told him we should leave, it's weird and wrong to be doing this and asked him to stop. He used his winning tactic; he started demeaning me, compared me to the other women, and said in summary that he would humiliate me if I didn't put out. He started removing my clothes, I felt stuck. I was so groomed into doing what he wished. He removed his clothes and started touching himself, groping my body and muttering what he wanted to do to me. I was on my period and I was both scared he would see my pad and use that to humiliate me, but also hoped it would be a way to stop him. It didn't, he brought me to the floor, now on top of me, pinning me down, grinding on me and moaning, forcing his fingers inside me and then his dick and took my virginity. In a minute he finished inside me. My jeans were stained with both fresh blood and my period and I was in pain, was spacey and mute. He got dressed, and held me, comforted me. And told me to ask my mum to come pick me up. We waited in silence while he scrolled his phone walking in and out of the room. When my mum arrived I went out to her car and he went to his and we went our separate ways. I never shared this with my family. This was the beginning of a coercive relationship that spanned 2yrs. He would take pictures of me naked, post them on [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] and threaten to share it with others if I didn't perform sexual acts on him. I was weak and let him have access to my body when he wanted and how he wanted. When I confided in a fellow female volunteer, the conversation was dismissed, she told me she was already aware that I was sleeping with [name omitted to preserve anonymity], \"everyone has had their time with [name omitted to preserve anonymity]\", he'd already been sleeping with her friends and even herself. She would flirt with him at work drinks, and resent when the boys would discuss the acts he would do to me. It was entertainment, and it became a competition of which girl is best in the sack. A new female volunteer joined, 16yo at the time, and she was the new girl he pursued, he would send me naked photos of her and ask me why I didn't have an amazing body like hers, he would describe how much better she was in bed, he shared his [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] account that had hundreds of faceless nudes of other women he had fucked including her and me. And that day was when I realised I was part of his sick game. Even to this day I blame myself for being a part of this, for allowing him access to my body, and it's taken 10yrs and discussions in therapy to understand that what I experienced was sexual coercion, and I was targeted for my vulnerability. The charity community was in fact culpable, as I heard in our community socials, managers in their 40s would find entertainment in discussing the sexual acts these boys were doing to female volunteers. Even the father of one of the boys who was chairman of the charity would find these stories entertaining and high five the boys. Blurred lines and my not-so-aggressive approach to saying \"no\" was what made me feel like I am the one to blame. It destroyed my sense of self-worth, regularly considering suicide between 17 and 18yrs old, and even attempting at a nearby railway line near my house. I am grateful I have grown a thicker skin, I am grateful I have confidence to leave situations I don't feel comfortable and call out sexually coercive behaviour - but learning the hard way affected my youth and the healing process was painful. I was hiding a dark and painful life for years, I certainly didn't need it while my family and I were, and still are, rebuilding our lives after my fathers conviction and the subsequent repossession, and it didn't serve any good to my education.",

I had never got into any trouble or had any real issues until I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] [date omitted to preserve anonymity].

I can see now in hindsight that this was linked to unresolved issues around loss and death, but at the age of [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I didn't know why I was doing what I was doing and I just felt angry at the world. This time coincided with becoming romantically/sexually involved with boys from school but as the drinking increased, my power and control over my decisions diminished. I ended up with a reputation as a girl who would do sexual acts and boys would capitalise on that - waiting for me to be drunk and then getting me to do things when I could barely stand. As a young person I thought I had control and choice over this, and in some instances I still think I did but there was a whole bunch of situations where I can now see I was sexually assaulted. There were some times that I don't remember, or that I do remember parts of, and distinctly remember not wanting to do things and saying no, but they still happened. It was only recently that I saw one man who I went to school with, who I have not seen since leaving school, that it really hit me. I felt physically sick seeing him. I was dragged straight back to being 15 in a woodland to an experience I had not thought of in 20 years. It was then I started to think about other situations and other boys. I wonder if the boys think about it in the same way, or whether they still think of me as a drunk girl, a sure thing, as someone who is consenting through their actions of being too drunk to say no, consenting through their reputation. I started to think about the fact that the staff at the school must have known what was going on - I know they did as one particularly awful teacher commented on me being 'promiscuous' in a class once. I have gone on to have a very sucessful career where I support people, some of whom have experienced sexual abuse.

        "body": "The first time I was assaulted was backstage in a theatre by a co-actor during a theatre camp the summer I turned 15. He was 21. Because of him, I formed an eating disorder right as I was hitting puberty. I would refuse to eat until I couldn't recognize myself until I was no longer the girl he saw and liked so much. I have always wanted to be an actor, and the fact that it was backstage at a theatre was devastating for me. I remember I was learning to drive and once I started driving alone, I would have panic attacks while driving on the freeway because I would see his face in the backseat. I would have to pull over and convince myself he wasn't actually there. It took me most of high school to work through that experience. I finally was getting much better and truly not thinking about him and I felt confident in myself at college, I overcame my eating disorder and I was comfortable in myself. Then, in [date omitted to preserve anonymity], the beginning of my sophomore year of college, I went out to a bar with some of my friends, I wasn't that drunk and my roommate started dancing with this guy. I'm gay and only like women but sometimes it's fun to just fuck around at bars, especially bars that mostly just have straight men and women. So I started dancing with the guy's friend. My roommate and I were dancing next to each other with these guys. And the guy I was dancing with somehow pulled us away from my friends and my roommate and raped me in the corner of the bar. It was so crowded no one could see us, my friends had no clue where I went and I didn't know where they were. I'm not sure how long it lasted, but I was just trying to lock eyes with someone I knew. Finally, one of my friends saw me and pulled me further into the dance floor. I didn't report it because I didn't even know the guy's name, I would not be able to identify him if he was right in front of me. That experience set me into the deepest depression I have ever been in in my life. I was showing signs of alcoholism because of it, coming home every night from classes and drinking half a bottle or a full bottle of wine by myself. I was actively suicidal and almost attempted on two different occasions. But now, [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I finally feel like I am in a good place, I still can't go to that bar but I feel confident in myself, and my sexuality, and I don't feel like it was my fault anymore. And it is still hard because I feel like these things will never go away. And sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I had tried to report it. But I am so proud of myself for how far I've come and I am so proud of the person I've become and how I was able to pick myself back up and try to love living again.",

Me and my other cousin, his sister, who is a year younger than me would constantly bombard him on the couch, trying to get him to play with us. He would, but different than the way that I would with my own brothers. Me and my girl cousin would sit on his legs, our signal that we had won the fight. Then, he would tell me to \"sit on his face\". I didn't know what he was saying, what it meant or implied, I just thought it was how I would officially win our so-called battles. I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for following his orders. Sometimes, he would place his hands on his face when I sat, and squeeze my butt. I would say \"ew, you're touching my butt\". \"Eww\" he would repeat, while further digging his boney fingers into my ass. I don't know how many times this happened. A lot. I knew it felt wrong but I didn't know why. I also didn't know why I couldn't sleep in my own room at night, or why I would check behind my door and under any bed a total of 10 times before I could sleep. It wasn't one specific moment when I discovered I was assaulted, but as I got older I gradually realized what happened and I swore I would take it to my grave. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I told my therapist and some close friends. I was diagnosed with anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. My parents would yell at me for being rude and antisocial at family events (most of which I felt physically sick during). I want to mention that my parents are my two best friends, I told them everything other than this. I didn't want to ruin my moms relationship with her sister (his mom). I felt I would be responsible for our families demise. I was scared of most men. Eventually, I told my parents, they were very understanding and do not make me see him, letting me skip out on some family events. This will forever alter my relationship with sex, and men as a whole. And I live with the knowledge that he will most likely be at my wedding, because he is family and unless I tell my other extended family who I am close to, he can't be the only one I don't invite. I live my life in fear of being raped, because I could barley survive being assaulted. The worst part is, I always feel like I am overreacting and unjustified in the trauma I feel. And this is disgusting, but sometimes I almost wish worse had happened to me so that at least the trauma I feel would match what my mind tries to tell me is worthy of that response. If that makes sense. People tell me to not let it define me, but I don't even know who I would be if it hadn't happened. Thank you for taking your time and reading this.

I want to talk to them about their growing beauty and self confidence and not feel like I have to warn them not to act certain ways or dress certain ways. But I was once a young and blossoming teenager. And I was on a uni trip. In my first year at uni. We went to a famous landmark in a foreign city. My friend and I met some local boys. We went to their flat. I had sex with one of the three boys. Then they wanted me to have sex with his friends too. Which I didn\u2019t want to. They wanted my friend to. She didn\u2019t want to. Suddenly I felt like the situation had changed. There were three of them and two of us. We were in a strange city, no one knew where we were. It was scary.

The only thing I didn\u2019t \u201clet them\u201d do was put their penis in my mouth. I said I\u2019d bite it off. But they put it in my vagina and anus. Two of them at once. I felt like a dead weight being spun. pulled and poked and just waiting for it to be over. The trip went home the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] with me included. Thank goodness. Afterwards I had cuts and bruises and scratches. And I went home from uni to my parents and they took to me to a rape centre. I didn\u2019t have HIV or any STIs. I didn\u2019t have counselling.

The guy was supposedly gay and i didnt think anything of it. we were in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] so i knew that what he was doing was wrong i just wasnt sure what to do. i told myself that because he was gay maybe he acted wierd to other girls? Im not sure ive never had a gay friend. It started off with hugs, then turned into grabbing my boobs and slapping my butt. i was in a friendship group with all boys so they all though i was a pussy if i was to tell anyone about it. it kept getting worse and worse. He did it to plenty of other girls too, about three or four? But not to the extent of what he did to me. I felt like i didnt have a voice as i know my schools history of mental health problems and sa. He was in most of my classes and that made me feel very uncomfortable and i skipped school alot and faked being sick just because i wouldnt have to see him. I went into my photography class and he decided to join my group. it was okay for about 10 mins but then he sat under the table and was pretending to be on his phone even though it was obvious he was taking pictures up my skirt. I crossed my legs and was contemplating saying something but im too socially anxious for that, he then got up and sat extremely close to me and rested his head on my shoulder. He then proceeded to put my hand on my thigh and proceeded to go higher and higher, nobody was there to witness it and i felt like if i was to tell anyone nobody would believe me. He put his hand up my skirt and was pulling it up, thats when i decided to take photos of him doing this whilst he was on his phone. i tried to tell my friends but as i thought none of them believed me and even when i showed them the photos they thought i was just over exaggerating. I told my mum [date omitted to preserve anonymity] it happened. she immediately contacted the school and we had a meeting. i wasnt in school for weeks because i have anxiety of going to school now because of that. it took the school about 2 days to actually have a meeting with me. I hated seeing him do it to other girls to so i knew i had to do something. we had the meeting and the first thing the person said is who is it and when? it had been going on for months but i only just bulit up the courage to say something. i showed her the photos and said that they will have a meeting with him asap. it wasnt asap he was in my classes and didnt have a meeting until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] which i think is absolutely disgusting!!!!! i was told that he denied everything he was accused of even though we had evidence. His parents didnt do anything to punish him and just blamed it on him being gay. the school said that there isnt much they can do atm and i was so mad. it took them 2 weeks to get him out of all of his classes and he had another meeting about how sa is wrong? isnt that common sense! He got excluded from my school about a month or two after reporting it. not suspended for the time being so they can wait for the paperwork to go through so he can be excluded. I had to see him everyday even after everything. My school is absolutely awful at dealing with sa and mental health. They need to get it sorted, because i dont want anything to happen to any other girl because the constant fear to even sit next to a man, i am traumatized by it and its still [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Couldve been resolved so easily if the school dealt with it better. Appauling. My school is a horrible school and dont even bother going to any of them for any of your problems.",

But all this happened every day I was round wherever he could find a good hiding spot whether that was after dinner , in my little play tent , in my parents bed or anywhere else . It still haunts me [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because no one else knows ; not even my own dad and I trust and love him more than anything , nor my boyfriend who has stuck with me through everything . There were multiple other times when I was young including when I was 11 when I went to the cinema with my Auntie and she left me with a friend , a boy , a few years older who wouldn\u2019t stop stroking my face even when I said no so I went out to my Auntie and told her I hated the film then after many months building up the hatred , terror and courage I told my mum and now I never see that boy anymore . I was also 13 roundabout when my dad had a different girlfriend who had two sons ; one bratty 12 year old and a slobbery but cute 3 year old . I only got on with the younger one as I would have constant arguments over unnecessary stuff with the older one but one day when me and the older brother were play fighting in the bunk bed he flipped me , pinned me and sat on top of me . I could feel him attempting to dry hump me while I was still stuck but I wriggled out and he pretended like nothing happened , probably hoping I didn\u2019t notice but I did and I couldn\u2019t sleep that night . [date omitted to preserve anonymity] from now , I had a year long boyfriend and I thought he was amazing at the time but slowly he started to show his true dark colours where he would mentally , sexually and emotionally abuse me . He would constantly want to do sexual acts like play with me or me \u2018 help \u2018 him finish and if I was ever not in the mood he would get angry and then get upset with me to which I felt like I had to comply with him because his excuse was we cuddle all the time and we never do what I want or if I genuinely never gave in he would suggest and start watching porn because he assumed it would turn me on every time and it never did but I wanted him to shut up so I would \u2018 help \u2018 him . One time we were messing around and he attempted to try and start fingering me even though he never asked or told me he was going to and I started telling him I didn\u2019t want that and he was trying to convince me it would be okay and that it wouldn\u2019t harm anyone so he carried on thinking I was find with it then . I then started crying because the forcefulness and the words coming out of his mouth felt familiar but he didn\u2019t care and he started getting angry again and ignoring me while blaming me telling me I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want it . Online harassment is also a thing . I have also experienced this where who I thought was an alright mate asked me for nudes and I would get something in return . I never sent him nudes but I sent something suggest full where I was lying in bed but he kept asking for more but I told him there was no more than that . Even though I sent him the picture and it was kind of my fault I still felt peer pressured and horrible afterwards so I told my friend and he was completely on my side . I am telling you , rape is not always sexual assault / harassment . Blackmailing , guilt tripping , forcing are also slight examples of sexual assault . Do not be afraid to tell anyone or it will stick with you forever . Do not be afraid to say no and stick to no or it could lead to significant mental issues . Having someone by your side is not always a bad thing . They can help and stick by you . Even if you were slightly in the wrong , someone by your side is always mentally helpful .",

His girlfriend then burst into laughter and that\u2019s when I found out it was a dare. I felt so violated, it felt like I was naked in-front of the whole school, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t tell any teacher, I didn\u2019t know where to start or what to say, or what they would do. I didn\u2019t even know if there was anything to be done I instead kept my mouth shut. I later found out the same person (in year [date omitted to preserve anonymity]) also violated my friend. As she was handing out books she leaned over his desk, and that\u2019s when he took the opportunity to grope her boob, this time he was caught by a teacher as she was luckily watching, he was then punished. After my GCSEs I went to a sixth form. It was a very tight knit school and I felt like I didn\u2019t fit in. In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I found out a guy I liked was interested in me and I perused the relationship, it felt nice to be recognised and accepted. Though after we broke up, on a second glance I realised the relationship was sour. He had taken advantage of me. I felt manipulated and used. I had come out of the hospital high on anaesthetic from my procedure. I wanted him to be with me and he obliged coming to my house. There we laughed and joked about how high and out of it I was, he commented on how my pupils were huge. We then went to my room and cuddled nothing new, but as it does it progressed and he was trying to penetrate me. I learnt that I couldn\u2019t have consented because of my state, I felt violated and used, really upset. I felt let down, we had discussed the consequences of my anaesthetic, how I couldn\u2019t consent to anything legal because I want sober. consent is often mentioned in school, but only the stereotypical examples of no means no, never that someone who isn\u2019t sober can\u2019t consent, I felt let down. Later after our break up - which was for other reasons, I discovered before we were a couple he asked his sexualised me behind my back, asking his friends if they would \u201cfuck that\u201d when I was out of earshot. Who knows what else they discussed. This particularly is the most difficult part, I struggle to trust people when they mention the talk about me with friends. I don\u2019t know what else he said, what else they discussed and what they know about me that I thought was private and confidential. He violated me in so many ways but most of all my trust. It\u2019s hard knowing someone who was so kind and loving was in private so horrible and destructive. I was going through a lot at the time and he would often comment on how strong I was, how I was the strongest person he knows and how he was proud of me. I\u2019ve never told my mum that I\u2019ve been raped I don\u2019t know how to, it feels too private. There is so much more to this situation, but these are the essential, bare bones parts. To who ever reads this, you are strong and I am proud of you, don\u2019t let what they did define you. You are more than that. In time you will heal and grow but until then talk to people, always always talk. If not a teacher or parent, talk to your trusted friends xxx",

I stayed with him after all that. I let him cheat on me, manipulate me, guilt trip me and mentally drain me.

And since we were pretty much in the same class throughout school he would follow me to where I would hang out and chase me so he would hug me tight and bring his friend to make me feel pressured to hug him back. Then my teachers changed seating plans and they put me next to him since he asked them, and that was when it really started to get worse since he would bring me gifts and in return he would expect something which I refused then in classes he begun to feel me up like grabbing my inner thighs in class and staring at my chest and always had his eyes on me. And during science practicals he would \"accidentally\" trip and grab my chest multiple times and I was happy that a girl who I didn't know stood up for me I was thankful someone spoke up for me. But it continued anyway since he would follow me and I would feel his eyes on mine. Then online he began getting worse saying vulgar things and how he felt when he saw me at school which made me feel even more hyperaware of what he would do if he caught me alone. I would lock myself in bathrooms at breaktimes since he knew where I usually went and I just never came into school much. Then he began threatening me online and because I was a stupid kid I gave into those threats and gave him nudes which he then threatened me more with and he sent them to his friends and I never felt more humiliated. I was only 14. I mustered the courage to just block him on everything and speak to teachers in private to let me sit somewhere else and I ignored him in school and always had someone with me since he would try to get me alone. I'm so glad I finished school. But everyday I go to work I have to drive past where he works and I see him. I only decided to write this since he made an alternate account and added me again. I blocked him.",

It scarred up and the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i did it again, another 5 (This time i went deeper). I was sat in bed with my mum and my school trouser leg lifted up, showing the cuts that had now scabbed, on my legs. I told my mum it was my dog but i knew she knew it was self harm, I went to school and by the time i got back i confessed to my mum about my self harm and she told my school without my consent or telling me. My school did nothing to support me or help me when they found out about my self harm and i told my mum i would never self harm again. I was supposed to reach a year clean in 20 days from the day i wrote this but i relapsed 2 months before i was supposed to reach a year clean. I never confessed to anyone about this but all i can say is that my school didn\u2019t attempt to help me, they caused me to relapse when i opened up to them about having a stalker and after he sexually assaulted me on campus i told a staff member and they laughed it off and said he was just being silly because he was \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d. In the same year i was sexually harassed by a 17 year old boy in a room with CCTV. He pulled out his penis and started masturbating infront of me and looking at me at a close distance (About 2 Meters). I was shocked and stood still and was so scared to leave in case he grabbed me or tried to hurt me so i stood there, I feel like it was my fault but after my school found out when i opened up and it was all on CCTV for proof they told me he didnt understand and he was confused. The sexual harrasment and assault gave me flashbacks from when i was sexually assaulted by 3 different men (With no connection to eachother) and got my innocence and rights taken from me when i opened up about it i was silenced. I HAVE A VOICE, AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT BEING SEXUALLY HARRASED(ASSAULTED) BY 5 DIFFERENT MEN AND I WILL NOT BE SILENCED. This is the first time i have opened up about it.

I had gone on a night out with some girlfriends and bumped into a new, male friend who I had only started socialising with. I did fancy him so spent some time in the club flirting and having a couple of drinks. I had been drinking so I was drunk, but all of a sudden I was incredibly drunk and not in control. My memory of the whole night is very hazey. I\u2019m not insinuating he put anything in my drink, I had been drinking and at the time I was going off the rails and was drinking a lot so it is very likely that I had drunk too much. The next thing I woke up in a room that I didn\u2019t recognise and I was completely naked. I realised I was sharing the bed with someone and was actually relieved when I saw it was him and not a complete stranger. I asked him if we had had sex [date omitted to preserve anonymity] to which he replied with a yes so calmly as if it was all fine. I do not remember leaving the club, let alone arriving at his house and being undressed! At the time I was in a really low place and had no self-esteem. And I am ashamed to say that I had consensual sex with him in the morning. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand the severity of what had happened and I was just grateful I wasn\u2019t alone. It\u2019s been a few years now and it\u2019s something I think about a lot. I blame myself for not seeing what was wrong with it and sleeping with him in the morning. As I can\u2019t remember the night at all, I also constantly wonder what happened during the period of time between leaving the club and waking up. I question myself all the time about how things could have happened - how did I get up the stairs, how did I get undressed, how could I have had sex?! I\u2019ve been reading a lot on unacknowledged rape which is where this meets the legal definition of rape but at the time the victim (me) didn\u2019t see it in that way and saw it as a misunderstanding or a bad night. I am still very confused about the whole thing. I don\u2019t think he is a bad person but what happened was wrong. We continued to be friends and classed it as a one-night stand.",

He was clearly a little bit unhappy. He also kept trying to get into my bra but I said no but he kept trying so I was like not [date omitted to preserve anonymity], this went on for the whole evebubg. Then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] we met up at his house again and it was just bad. Like we made out consensually at first but then he kept pushing and pushing for me to sit on top of him in a specific position. Like and make out that way, he did it to me but I kept saying maybe not or finding excuses but he still did it . We couldn\u2019t even watch the TV because he would not get his hands off me for two minutes and just watch the film. Then later on he kept using this excuse saying people form school have said we should do this or that etc etc and then said they\u2019re saying I should finger you, I said maybe not [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because it\u2019s a bit too soon. Then he proceeded to show me his hard penis and put my hand on it. I left it there a for a few seconds because I felt bad and then took it away. I was uncomfortable and tried to get him to put it away but he kept trying to make out with his penis outside his pants while on me but I kept pushing him away saying maybe put it away. Eventually he put it away, thank goodness but he kept trying to get inside my bra , I was wearing an open neck top so he could feel my chest, not boobs, I was okay with this, but wasn\u2019t tooo keen. Then he kept going inside my bra and I would put my hand over it so he couldn\u2019t get to my nipple or anything but he kept trying to move my hand and kiss it. It was actually disgusting but there was genuinely nothing I could\u2019ve done . Like this kept going on, eventually he just restrained my hands and said wait a minute you\u2019ll love this and proceeded to kiss my boobs and stuff. Like I genuinely didn\u2019t want this, but he kept doing it, i also kept saying maybe later maybe later to try and delay it. I understand I never said \u2018 no\u2019 to the boob stuff but I said maybe another day and I was clearly uncomfortable and told him to please slow things down. Eventually 10 mins before dinner I told him maybe u should wait for ur penis to go floppy because ur parents might see. He then said his parents wouldn\u2019t mind, so I was like but it won\u2019t look good on me and it\u2019s important for them to like me. He stopped the boob and penis stuff but kept pressuring me to make out and get on top of him. I did it once to make him happy and so he would stop asking. And then dinner came. After dinner I used breath bot smelling nice and using that as an excuse, he bought it but kept pressuring me, but I kept persisting with the excuse until my mum came to pick me up. Then at school this rumour that is did a hand job on him went round. I denied this and told one close friend (who doesn\u2019t gossip at all) that he put my hand on his penis, not realising it was sexual assault until I got called in by the school . I only told them about the penis stuff as that was what was reported and soet of defended the boy in a sense because she said she may have to get the police and my parents involved. Because I don\u2019t get on well with a parent and couldn\u2019t risk this coming out I defended the boy saying he just got too caught up in the moment and it was nothing serious. When he got interviewed about the penis stuff the school concluded that it was \u2018experimentation\u2019 that went a little too far. my reputation is trashed because of this and it\u2019s horrible that he can just get away with this but I know I hould\u2019ve said something when I was getting talked to.",

Teachers will flip the blame onto girls saying how it is our fault or try to say we are being aggressive or starting drama. I feel unsafe around boys in my year and i feel as if girls in our school are silenced.",

But now I\u2019m not because now I know it wasn\u2019t my fault. When I was in primary school I was heavily bullied and only really had one friend at the time. This friend was in almost all of my classes which wasn\u2019t an issue at the time really because well I thought she was my friend. She began being really creepy and obsessive later on that year, she would give me pens and pencils that she would boast about having fingered herself with, she would constantly grab at my private parts and play it off as \u2018a joke\u2019 but I knew it wasn\u2019t. Then we had swimming together and we had to change in front of our peers but she dragged me behind a wall on the other side of the changing rooms. She proceeded to touch me and grab at me and push me against the wall to hold me in place. She forced me down to feel at her parts and forced me to do very sexual things. She did this about 7 times and I never told anyone. She told me never to tell anyone anything because \u2018real friends keep secrets\u2019. I soon got her out of my life luckily and I could not be happier. But this was secondary school and bullying was so much worse. I told one of my friends who proceeded to belittle me and tell me \u2018that\u2019s not even a big deal if you\u2019re even telling the truth\u2019. I felt disgusted and ashamed and I just felt dirty. I felt that I couldn\u2019t get the feeling of her hands off of me. I felt like I could never be clean. From a young age I had been self harming and this only got worse. Just when I felt I was getting over it something happened again. I went out on my own late at night to go get myself a small drink and snack from the shops because I couldn\u2019t sleep and the corner shop didn\u2019t shut. When I was walking out I got pulled into this alleyway. This man pushed me against the wall and pinned me there. He touched me, groped me, he made me take his d*ck down my throat and almost r*ped me but I kicked him a lot in a final attempt to get away and I did. I ran for over an hour as he chased me and I finally got away. I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere ever. It\u2019s even harder because I\u2019m trans, and I feel like if I was just born a boy then there would be less of a chance this would happen to me. I feel like I will never be a boy because I was touched in that way. My mental health is incredibly bad but I\u2019m trying my best to work through it These experiences still haunt me and I feel that they always will but I won\u2019t let them control me",

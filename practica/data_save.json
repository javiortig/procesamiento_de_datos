He started sending me pictures of knives and threatening me with them. Then one day we had a really bad aurgement over a boy making me uncomfortable. He started getting really mad calling me names, showing my knives, telling me to shut up or fuck off. I left him alone for abit to cool off, then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I got a text from him saying \"im so sorry about what happened babe. To make it up to you. Ill come meet you.\" I was suspicious but forgot about it soon. I met him at a local shop near my house. I saw him, I ran up to him and went to hug him. Then I realised he had a knife in his hand. He pressed it up against my back and said \"better fucking behave\" I immediately froze. I was terrified. We got on a bus back to his house it was a large house but not very large. His room was painted a beige colour and he had a desk next to his bed and a window. He pushed me up against thr bed. Pinned my hands above my head against the wall. N started taking our clothes off. I started kicking. Really hard. And he got more and more pissed and proceeded to molest me. I can remember a pain in my stomach and back. And can remember blood everywhere. I cried. And cried. And cried. He held me and fell asleep when he was done. I manged to get off him without waking him up and jumping out the window. I still had like 20 quid on me so I ran to the bus stop n caught a bus back home.",

He had a job to do at his cousin's house, and I was left to play with her secondary-school age son. At some point he convinced me to climb under his bed and help him with his homework. He then put a thermometer inside my vagina. I don't recall much about it, but know that he told me it should be a secret. The second instance was during my early teens, my second year of secondary school. I used to get off the bus at my grans house and stay with her until my mum got home. I would usually either go and sit in the kitchen or front room and watch telly. I don't remember the details of how it came about but I think it started that I'd always go and give my grandad a kiss on the cheek as a greeting when I came in, and he must have turned his face towards me one day. Eventually, it became that I would sit next to him on the sofa and he would kiss me inappropriately for minutes at a time. I don't remember when or why it stopped, but I just remember being glad it had. I felt so confused, was he cheating on my gran? I was only 12. I let both of these memories pass in to the distant memories of my early life as I had clearly decided to not report the behaviours so couldn't see any point in hashing it up in my mind. I didn't realise that I should have sought help for the mental repercussions, as I feel these two instances are the reason that I spent my teenage years putting myself in increasingly dangerous situations and having sex with strangers, being taken advantage of and being abused by men who took my lack of no to be a yes. I am now a stable, settled 30 year old and am married with two children and my husband is the kindest, most respectful and caring man you could meet. I am one of the lucky ones.

From sexual conquest lists to being treated like objects of sexual desires we have faced many obstacles throughout. When reported to the staff the biggest consequence given was a verbal warning. Even though we all sat through a briefing at the start of the university year about how sexual harassment was not tolerated in the navy and that it would be instant dismissal. The staff wonder why we don't take welfare issues to them, but how can we if we don't feel like our voices can be heard. One incidence [date omitted to preserve anonymity] a major perpetrator of the sexual harassment was promoted into a position of leadership. One of the very people we are meant to go to when we have an issue. The staff even found what he did funny, Our commanding officer even referring to his sexual conquest list as his \"ultimate orgy list\". A member of staff once made me feel as though I hadn't earned my place in my unit fairly and suggested that my bruises were not from an obstacle course that I had just done but because I had a boyfriend. Repeatedly making comments similar to this even once I had made it clear that it was making me uncomfortable. I have faced multiple sexual harassment comments made by people who have previously been on verbal warnings.

The whole issue is perpetuated by the boys club in the leadership team. They just want to protect themselves. When it came out that a large percentage of the girls in the unit were unhappy and had complained we all received messages from the boys about how they felt they had done nothing wrong and why hadn't we told them before. When we had all tried on so many occasions. The fact that the person in charge of welfare [date omitted to preserve anonymity] was part of the 'boys club' only made the issue worse.

        "body": "I was emotionally, financially and physically vulnerable at the time - at 15 my father had been jailed, our house, money and belongings repossessed and trying to carry on with education and life while hiding this situation from the small middle class white community we lived in and already felt alienated from. My mother who had not worked for +20yrs was also found guilty in the court case, while doing her court ordered community service hours she struggled to get a paid job to help provide for the household, claiming benefits and always counting her pennies; we were all trying our best to make ends meet and build a stable life again. At the time, I aspired to be a doctor just like some of the richest and smartest family members I had, and so pursued as much work experience and volunteering as I could. I joined a local disabled charity, one that ran weekly activities and summer camps for disabled children. All the volunteers were around my age and up to mid 20s, with the managers being from mid 20s to 40s. I was successful in the interview process and was onboarded into an establishment I could not have imagined existed given it is a charity with a mission to provide life-long support to the local disabled community. There was a clear position of power for the managers and leaders in their mid 20s, both directly and indirectly - in working conditions they were the boss, in social positions they would openly discuss the female volunteers sexually and compare us. On numerous occasions, 3 of the leaders leveraged settings like 1:1 car shares, 1:1 tasks that were away from the group, and after-work drinks to sexually harass and eventually sexually assault me which is the story I want to share. One of the leaders had been giving me a lot of attention - one on one I would receive flattery, kind words, sometimes tasteful jokes, but in group settings would find ways to make me feel small, weak and ugly amongst the other volunteers. Without realising, I was being groomed to yearn for his validation and make him happy; this went on 5days a week for 2months. Nearing the end of the summer camp, us volunteers and leaders were helping prepare the charity building for renovation - clearing out items and putting rubbish in skips, I was 16 and couldn't drive, so as per his information, I told my mother to pick me up at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. As [date omitted to preserve anonymity] approached, the volunteers and leaders started grabbing their belongings and said their goodbyes, I called out to one of the leaders and said \"where's everyone going? [name omitted to preserve anonymity] told me we're finishing at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]\". That leader laughed and said \"no, we finish at [date omitted to preserve anonymity] but maybe he has something for you to do\", gave a smirk to two of the older boys and left with everyone. I wanted to text my mother to tell her to pick me up as soon as she can, it was only me and [name omitted to preserve anonymity] in the building, but he told me not to, gave me comforting words that he just wanted to spend some time with me without everyone getting in the way. He began touching my body. He described what he loved about my body, how he found me attractive and how much he liked me and began kissing my neck and then my lips, and pulled me into, what was, the soft play area. I said to him I felt uncomfortable, I felt weird and told him we should leave, it's weird and wrong to be doing this and asked him to stop. He used his winning tactic; he started demeaning me, compared me to the other women, and said in summary that he would humiliate me if I didn't put out. He started removing my clothes, I felt stuck. I was so groomed into doing what he wished. He removed his clothes and started touching himself, groping my body and muttering what he wanted to do to me. I was on my period and I was both scared he would see my pad and use that to humiliate me, but also hoped it would be a way to stop him. It didn't, he brought me to the floor, now on top of me, pinning me down, grinding on me and moaning, forcing his fingers inside me and then his dick and took my virginity. In a minute he finished inside me. My jeans were stained with both fresh blood and my period and I was in pain, was spacey and mute. He got dressed, and held me, comforted me. And told me to ask my mum to come pick me up. We waited in silence while he scrolled his phone walking in and out of the room. When my mum arrived I went out to her car and he went to his and we went our separate ways. I never shared this with my family. This was the beginning of a coercive relationship that spanned 2yrs. He would take pictures of me naked, post them on [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] and threaten to share it with others if I didn't perform sexual acts on him. I was weak and let him have access to my body when he wanted and how he wanted. When I confided in a fellow female volunteer, the conversation was dismissed, she told me she was already aware that I was sleeping with [name omitted to preserve anonymity], \"everyone has had their time with [name omitted to preserve anonymity]\", he'd already been sleeping with her friends and even herself. She would flirt with him at work drinks, and resent when the boys would discuss the acts he would do to me. It was entertainment, and it became a competition of which girl is best in the sack. A new female volunteer joined, 16yo at the time, and she was the new girl he pursued, he would send me naked photos of her and ask me why I didn't have an amazing body like hers, he would describe how much better she was in bed, he shared his [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] account that had hundreds of faceless nudes of other women he had fucked including her and me. And that day was when I realised I was part of his sick game. Even to this day I blame myself for being a part of this, for allowing him access to my body, and it's taken 10yrs and discussions in therapy to understand that what I experienced was sexual coercion, and I was targeted for my vulnerability. The charity community was in fact culpable, as I heard in our community socials, managers in their 40s would find entertainment in discussing the sexual acts these boys were doing to female volunteers. Even the father of one of the boys who was chairman of the charity would find these stories entertaining and high five the boys. Blurred lines and my not-so-aggressive approach to saying \"no\" was what made me feel like I am the one to blame. It destroyed my sense of self-worth, regularly considering suicide between 17 and 18yrs old, and even attempting at a nearby railway line near my house. I am grateful I have grown a thicker skin, I am grateful I have confidence to leave situations I don't feel comfortable and call out sexually coercive behaviour - but learning the hard way affected my youth and the healing process was painful. I was hiding a dark and painful life for years, I certainly didn't need it while my family and I were, and still are, rebuilding our lives after my fathers conviction and the subsequent repossession, and it didn't serve any good to my education.",

I had never got into any trouble or had any real issues until I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] [date omitted to preserve anonymity].

I can see now in hindsight that this was linked to unresolved issues around loss and death, but at the age of [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I didn't know why I was doing what I was doing and I just felt angry at the world. This time coincided with becoming romantically/sexually involved with boys from school but as the drinking increased, my power and control over my decisions diminished. I ended up with a reputation as a girl who would do sexual acts and boys would capitalise on that - waiting for me to be drunk and then getting me to do things when I could barely stand. As a young person I thought I had control and choice over this, and in some instances I still think I did but there was a whole bunch of situations where I can now see I was sexually assaulted. There were some times that I don't remember, or that I do remember parts of, and distinctly remember not wanting to do things and saying no, but they still happened. It was only recently that I saw one man who I went to school with, who I have not seen since leaving school, that it really hit me. I felt physically sick seeing him. I was dragged straight back to being 15 in a woodland to an experience I had not thought of in 20 years. It was then I started to think about other situations and other boys. I wonder if the boys think about it in the same way, or whether they still think of me as a drunk girl, a sure thing, as someone who is consenting through their actions of being too drunk to say no, consenting through their reputation. I started to think about the fact that the staff at the school must have known what was going on - I know they did as one particularly awful teacher commented on me being 'promiscuous' in a class once. I have gone on to have a very sucessful career where I support people, some of whom have experienced sexual abuse.

        "body": "The first time I was assaulted was backstage in a theatre by a co-actor during a theatre camp the summer I turned 15. He was 21. Because of him, I formed an eating disorder right as I was hitting puberty. I would refuse to eat until I couldn't recognize myself until I was no longer the girl he saw and liked so much. I have always wanted to be an actor, and the fact that it was backstage at a theatre was devastating for me. I remember I was learning to drive and once I started driving alone, I would have panic attacks while driving on the freeway because I would see his face in the backseat. I would have to pull over and convince myself he wasn't actually there. It took me most of high school to work through that experience. I finally was getting much better and truly not thinking about him and I felt confident in myself at college, I overcame my eating disorder and I was comfortable in myself. Then, in [date omitted to preserve anonymity], the beginning of my sophomore year of college, I went out to a bar with some of my friends, I wasn't that drunk and my roommate started dancing with this guy. I'm gay and only like women but sometimes it's fun to just fuck around at bars, especially bars that mostly just have straight men and women. So I started dancing with the guy's friend. My roommate and I were dancing next to each other with these guys. And the guy I was dancing with somehow pulled us away from my friends and my roommate and raped me in the corner of the bar. It was so crowded no one could see us, my friends had no clue where I went and I didn't know where they were. I'm not sure how long it lasted, but I was just trying to lock eyes with someone I knew. Finally, one of my friends saw me and pulled me further into the dance floor. I didn't report it because I didn't even know the guy's name, I would not be able to identify him if he was right in front of me. That experience set me into the deepest depression I have ever been in in my life. I was showing signs of alcoholism because of it, coming home every night from classes and drinking half a bottle or a full bottle of wine by myself. I was actively suicidal and almost attempted on two different occasions. But now, [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I finally feel like I am in a good place, I still can't go to that bar but I feel confident in myself, and my sexuality, and I don't feel like it was my fault anymore. And it is still hard because I feel like these things will never go away. And sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I had tried to report it. But I am so proud of myself for how far I've come and I am so proud of the person I've become and how I was able to pick myself back up and try to love living again.",

Me and my other cousin, his sister, who is a year younger than me would constantly bombard him on the couch, trying to get him to play with us. He would, but different than the way that I would with my own brothers. Me and my girl cousin would sit on his legs, our signal that we had won the fight. Then, he would tell me to \"sit on his face\". I didn't know what he was saying, what it meant or implied, I just thought it was how I would officially win our so-called battles. I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for following his orders. Sometimes, he would place his hands on his face when I sat, and squeeze my butt. I would say \"ew, you're touching my butt\". \"Eww\" he would repeat, while further digging his boney fingers into my ass. I don't know how many times this happened. A lot. I knew it felt wrong but I didn't know why. I also didn't know why I couldn't sleep in my own room at night, or why I would check behind my door and under any bed a total of 10 times before I could sleep. It wasn't one specific moment when I discovered I was assaulted, but as I got older I gradually realized what happened and I swore I would take it to my grave. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I told my therapist and some close friends. I was diagnosed with anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. My parents would yell at me for being rude and antisocial at family events (most of which I felt physically sick during). I want to mention that my parents are my two best friends, I told them everything other than this. I didn't want to ruin my moms relationship with her sister (his mom). I felt I would be responsible for our families demise. I was scared of most men. Eventually, I told my parents, they were very understanding and do not make me see him, letting me skip out on some family events. This will forever alter my relationship with sex, and men as a whole. And I live with the knowledge that he will most likely be at my wedding, because he is family and unless I tell my other extended family who I am close to, he can't be the only one I don't invite. I live my life in fear of being raped, because I could barley survive being assaulted. The worst part is, I always feel like I am overreacting and unjustified in the trauma I feel. And this is disgusting, but sometimes I almost wish worse had happened to me so that at least the trauma I feel would match what my mind tries to tell me is worthy of that response. If that makes sense. People tell me to not let it define me, but I don't even know who I would be if it hadn't happened. Thank you for taking your time and reading this.

I want to talk to them about their growing beauty and self confidence and not feel like I have to warn them not to act certain ways or dress certain ways. But I was once a young and blossoming teenager. And I was on a uni trip. In my first year at uni. We went to a famous landmark in a foreign city. My friend and I met some local boys. We went to their flat. I had sex with one of the three boys. Then they wanted me to have sex with his friends too. Which I didn\u2019t want to. They wanted my friend to. She didn\u2019t want to. Suddenly I felt like the situation had changed. There were three of them and two of us. We were in a strange city, no one knew where we were. It was scary.

The only thing I didn\u2019t \u201clet them\u201d do was put their penis in my mouth. I said I\u2019d bite it off. But they put it in my vagina and anus. Two of them at once. I felt like a dead weight being spun. pulled and poked and just waiting for it to be over. The trip went home the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] with me included. Thank goodness. Afterwards I had cuts and bruises and scratches. And I went home from uni to my parents and they took to me to a rape centre. I didn\u2019t have HIV or any STIs. I didn\u2019t have counselling.

The guy was supposedly gay and i didnt think anything of it. we were in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] so i knew that what he was doing was wrong i just wasnt sure what to do. i told myself that because he was gay maybe he acted wierd to other girls? Im not sure ive never had a gay friend. It started off with hugs, then turned into grabbing my boobs and slapping my butt. i was in a friendship group with all boys so they all though i was a pussy if i was to tell anyone about it. it kept getting worse and worse. He did it to plenty of other girls too, about three or four? But not to the extent of what he did to me. I felt like i didnt have a voice as i know my schools history of mental health problems and sa. He was in most of my classes and that made me feel very uncomfortable and i skipped school alot and faked being sick just because i wouldnt have to see him. I went into my photography class and he decided to join my group. it was okay for about 10 mins but then he sat under the table and was pretending to be on his phone even though it was obvious he was taking pictures up my skirt. I crossed my legs and was contemplating saying something but im too socially anxious for that, he then got up and sat extremely close to me and rested his head on my shoulder. He then proceeded to put my hand on my thigh and proceeded to go higher and higher, nobody was there to witness it and i felt like if i was to tell anyone nobody would believe me. He put his hand up my skirt and was pulling it up, thats when i decided to take photos of him doing this whilst he was on his phone. i tried to tell my friends but as i thought none of them believed me and even when i showed them the photos they thought i was just over exaggerating. I told my mum [date omitted to preserve anonymity] it happened. she immediately contacted the school and we had a meeting. i wasnt in school for weeks because i have anxiety of going to school now because of that. it took the school about 2 days to actually have a meeting with me. I hated seeing him do it to other girls to so i knew i had to do something. we had the meeting and the first thing the person said is who is it and when? it had been going on for months but i only just bulit up the courage to say something. i showed her the photos and said that they will have a meeting with him asap. it wasnt asap he was in my classes and didnt have a meeting until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] which i think is absolutely disgusting!!!!! i was told that he denied everything he was accused of even though we had evidence. His parents didnt do anything to punish him and just blamed it on him being gay. the school said that there isnt much they can do atm and i was so mad. it took them 2 weeks to get him out of all of his classes and he had another meeting about how sa is wrong? isnt that common sense! He got excluded from my school about a month or two after reporting it. not suspended for the time being so they can wait for the paperwork to go through so he can be excluded. I had to see him everyday even after everything. My school is absolutely awful at dealing with sa and mental health. They need to get it sorted, because i dont want anything to happen to any other girl because the constant fear to even sit next to a man, i am traumatized by it and its still [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Couldve been resolved so easily if the school dealt with it better. Appauling. My school is a horrible school and dont even bother going to any of them for any of your problems.",

But all this happened every day I was round wherever he could find a good hiding spot whether that was after dinner , in my little play tent , in my parents bed or anywhere else . It still haunts me [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because no one else knows ; not even my own dad and I trust and love him more than anything , nor my boyfriend who has stuck with me through everything . There were multiple other times when I was young including when I was 11 when I went to the cinema with my Auntie and she left me with a friend , a boy , a few years older who wouldn\u2019t stop stroking my face even when I said no so I went out to my Auntie and told her I hated the film then after many months building up the hatred , terror and courage I told my mum and now I never see that boy anymore . I was also 13 roundabout when my dad had a different girlfriend who had two sons ; one bratty 12 year old and a slobbery but cute 3 year old . I only got on with the younger one as I would have constant arguments over unnecessary stuff with the older one but one day when me and the older brother were play fighting in the bunk bed he flipped me , pinned me and sat on top of me . I could feel him attempting to dry hump me while I was still stuck but I wriggled out and he pretended like nothing happened , probably hoping I didn\u2019t notice but I did and I couldn\u2019t sleep that night . [date omitted to preserve anonymity] from now , I had a year long boyfriend and I thought he was amazing at the time but slowly he started to show his true dark colours where he would mentally , sexually and emotionally abuse me . He would constantly want to do sexual acts like play with me or me \u2018 help \u2018 him finish and if I was ever not in the mood he would get angry and then get upset with me to which I felt like I had to comply with him because his excuse was we cuddle all the time and we never do what I want or if I genuinely never gave in he would suggest and start watching porn because he assumed it would turn me on every time and it never did but I wanted him to shut up so I would \u2018 help \u2018 him . One time we were messing around and he attempted to try and start fingering me even though he never asked or told me he was going to and I started telling him I didn\u2019t want that and he was trying to convince me it would be okay and that it wouldn\u2019t harm anyone so he carried on thinking I was find with it then . I then started crying because the forcefulness and the words coming out of his mouth felt familiar but he didn\u2019t care and he started getting angry again and ignoring me while blaming me telling me I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want it . Online harassment is also a thing . I have also experienced this where who I thought was an alright mate asked me for nudes and I would get something in return . I never sent him nudes but I sent something suggest full where I was lying in bed but he kept asking for more but I told him there was no more than that . Even though I sent him the picture and it was kind of my fault I still felt peer pressured and horrible afterwards so I told my friend and he was completely on my side . I am telling you , rape is not always sexual assault / harassment . Blackmailing , guilt tripping , forcing are also slight examples of sexual assault . Do not be afraid to tell anyone or it will stick with you forever . Do not be afraid to say no and stick to no or it could lead to significant mental issues . Having someone by your side is not always a bad thing . They can help and stick by you . Even if you were slightly in the wrong , someone by your side is always mentally helpful .",

His girlfriend then burst into laughter and that\u2019s when I found out it was a dare. I felt so violated, it felt like I was naked in-front of the whole school, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t tell any teacher, I didn\u2019t know where to start or what to say, or what they would do. I didn\u2019t even know if there was anything to be done I instead kept my mouth shut. I later found out the same person (in year [date omitted to preserve anonymity]) also violated my friend. As she was handing out books she leaned over his desk, and that\u2019s when he took the opportunity to grope her boob, this time he was caught by a teacher as she was luckily watching, he was then punished. After my GCSEs I went to a sixth form. It was a very tight knit school and I felt like I didn\u2019t fit in. In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I found out a guy I liked was interested in me and I perused the relationship, it felt nice to be recognised and accepted. Though after we broke up, on a second glance I realised the relationship was sour. He had taken advantage of me. I felt manipulated and used. I had come out of the hospital high on anaesthetic from my procedure. I wanted him to be with me and he obliged coming to my house. There we laughed and joked about how high and out of it I was, he commented on how my pupils were huge. We then went to my room and cuddled nothing new, but as it does it progressed and he was trying to penetrate me. I learnt that I couldn\u2019t have consented because of my state, I felt violated and used, really upset. I felt let down, we had discussed the consequences of my anaesthetic, how I couldn\u2019t consent to anything legal because I want sober. consent is often mentioned in school, but only the stereotypical examples of no means no, never that someone who isn\u2019t sober can\u2019t consent, I felt let down. Later after our break up - which was for other reasons, I discovered before we were a couple he asked his sexualised me behind my back, asking his friends if they would \u201cfuck that\u201d when I was out of earshot. Who knows what else they discussed. This particularly is the most difficult part, I struggle to trust people when they mention the talk about me with friends. I don\u2019t know what else he said, what else they discussed and what they know about me that I thought was private and confidential. He violated me in so many ways but most of all my trust. It\u2019s hard knowing someone who was so kind and loving was in private so horrible and destructive. I was going through a lot at the time and he would often comment on how strong I was, how I was the strongest person he knows and how he was proud of me. I\u2019ve never told my mum that I\u2019ve been raped I don\u2019t know how to, it feels too private. There is so much more to this situation, but these are the essential, bare bones parts. To who ever reads this, you are strong and I am proud of you, don\u2019t let what they did define you. You are more than that. In time you will heal and grow but until then talk to people, always always talk. If not a teacher or parent, talk to your trusted friends xxx",

I stayed with him after all that. I let him cheat on me, manipulate me, guilt trip me and mentally drain me.

And since we were pretty much in the same class throughout school he would follow me to where I would hang out and chase me so he would hug me tight and bring his friend to make me feel pressured to hug him back. Then my teachers changed seating plans and they put me next to him since he asked them, and that was when it really started to get worse since he would bring me gifts and in return he would expect something which I refused then in classes he begun to feel me up like grabbing my inner thighs in class and staring at my chest and always had his eyes on me. And during science practicals he would \"accidentally\" trip and grab my chest multiple times and I was happy that a girl who I didn't know stood up for me I was thankful someone spoke up for me. But it continued anyway since he would follow me and I would feel his eyes on mine. Then online he began getting worse saying vulgar things and how he felt when he saw me at school which made me feel even more hyperaware of what he would do if he caught me alone. I would lock myself in bathrooms at breaktimes since he knew where I usually went and I just never came into school much. Then he began threatening me online and because I was a stupid kid I gave into those threats and gave him nudes which he then threatened me more with and he sent them to his friends and I never felt more humiliated. I was only 14. I mustered the courage to just block him on everything and speak to teachers in private to let me sit somewhere else and I ignored him in school and always had someone with me since he would try to get me alone. I'm so glad I finished school. But everyday I go to work I have to drive past where he works and I see him. I only decided to write this since he made an alternate account and added me again. I blocked him.",

It scarred up and the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i did it again, another 5 (This time i went deeper). I was sat in bed with my mum and my school trouser leg lifted up, showing the cuts that had now scabbed, on my legs. I told my mum it was my dog but i knew she knew it was self harm, I went to school and by the time i got back i confessed to my mum about my self harm and she told my school without my consent or telling me. My school did nothing to support me or help me when they found out about my self harm and i told my mum i would never self harm again. I was supposed to reach a year clean in 20 days from the day i wrote this but i relapsed 2 months before i was supposed to reach a year clean. I never confessed to anyone about this but all i can say is that my school didn\u2019t attempt to help me, they caused me to relapse when i opened up to them about having a stalker and after he sexually assaulted me on campus i told a staff member and they laughed it off and said he was just being silly because he was \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d. In the same year i was sexually harassed by a 17 year old boy in a room with CCTV. He pulled out his penis and started masturbating infront of me and looking at me at a close distance (About 2 Meters). I was shocked and stood still and was so scared to leave in case he grabbed me or tried to hurt me so i stood there, I feel like it was my fault but after my school found out when i opened up and it was all on CCTV for proof they told me he didnt understand and he was confused. The sexual harrasment and assault gave me flashbacks from when i was sexually assaulted by 3 different men (With no connection to eachother) and got my innocence and rights taken from me when i opened up about it i was silenced. I HAVE A VOICE, AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT BEING SEXUALLY HARRASED(ASSAULTED) BY 5 DIFFERENT MEN AND I WILL NOT BE SILENCED. This is the first time i have opened up about it.

I had gone on a night out with some girlfriends and bumped into a new, male friend who I had only started socialising with. I did fancy him so spent some time in the club flirting and having a couple of drinks. I had been drinking so I was drunk, but all of a sudden I was incredibly drunk and not in control. My memory of the whole night is very hazey. I\u2019m not insinuating he put anything in my drink, I had been drinking and at the time I was going off the rails and was drinking a lot so it is very likely that I had drunk too much. The next thing I woke up in a room that I didn\u2019t recognise and I was completely naked. I realised I was sharing the bed with someone and was actually relieved when I saw it was him and not a complete stranger. I asked him if we had had sex [date omitted to preserve anonymity] to which he replied with a yes so calmly as if it was all fine. I do not remember leaving the club, let alone arriving at his house and being undressed! At the time I was in a really low place and had no self-esteem. And I am ashamed to say that I had consensual sex with him in the morning. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand the severity of what had happened and I was just grateful I wasn\u2019t alone. It\u2019s been a few years now and it\u2019s something I think about a lot. I blame myself for not seeing what was wrong with it and sleeping with him in the morning. As I can\u2019t remember the night at all, I also constantly wonder what happened during the period of time between leaving the club and waking up. I question myself all the time about how things could have happened - how did I get up the stairs, how did I get undressed, how could I have had sex?! I\u2019ve been reading a lot on unacknowledged rape which is where this meets the legal definition of rape but at the time the victim (me) didn\u2019t see it in that way and saw it as a misunderstanding or a bad night. I am still very confused about the whole thing. I don\u2019t think he is a bad person but what happened was wrong. We continued to be friends and classed it as a one-night stand.",

He was clearly a little bit unhappy. He also kept trying to get into my bra but I said no but he kept trying so I was like not [date omitted to preserve anonymity], this went on for the whole evebubg. Then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] we met up at his house again and it was just bad. Like we made out consensually at first but then he kept pushing and pushing for me to sit on top of him in a specific position. Like and make out that way, he did it to me but I kept saying maybe not or finding excuses but he still did it . We couldn\u2019t even watch the TV because he would not get his hands off me for two minutes and just watch the film. Then later on he kept using this excuse saying people form school have said we should do this or that etc etc and then said they\u2019re saying I should finger you, I said maybe not [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because it\u2019s a bit too soon. Then he proceeded to show me his hard penis and put my hand on it. I left it there a for a few seconds because I felt bad and then took it away. I was uncomfortable and tried to get him to put it away but he kept trying to make out with his penis outside his pants while on me but I kept pushing him away saying maybe put it away. Eventually he put it away, thank goodness but he kept trying to get inside my bra , I was wearing an open neck top so he could feel my chest, not boobs, I was okay with this, but wasn\u2019t tooo keen. Then he kept going inside my bra and I would put my hand over it so he couldn\u2019t get to my nipple or anything but he kept trying to move my hand and kiss it. It was actually disgusting but there was genuinely nothing I could\u2019ve done . Like this kept going on, eventually he just restrained my hands and said wait a minute you\u2019ll love this and proceeded to kiss my boobs and stuff. Like I genuinely didn\u2019t want this, but he kept doing it, i also kept saying maybe later maybe later to try and delay it. I understand I never said \u2018 no\u2019 to the boob stuff but I said maybe another day and I was clearly uncomfortable and told him to please slow things down. Eventually 10 mins before dinner I told him maybe u should wait for ur penis to go floppy because ur parents might see. He then said his parents wouldn\u2019t mind, so I was like but it won\u2019t look good on me and it\u2019s important for them to like me. He stopped the boob and penis stuff but kept pressuring me to make out and get on top of him. I did it once to make him happy and so he would stop asking. And then dinner came. After dinner I used breath bot smelling nice and using that as an excuse, he bought it but kept pressuring me, but I kept persisting with the excuse until my mum came to pick me up. Then at school this rumour that is did a hand job on him went round. I denied this and told one close friend (who doesn\u2019t gossip at all) that he put my hand on his penis, not realising it was sexual assault until I got called in by the school . I only told them about the penis stuff as that was what was reported and soet of defended the boy in a sense because she said she may have to get the police and my parents involved. Because I don\u2019t get on well with a parent and couldn\u2019t risk this coming out I defended the boy saying he just got too caught up in the moment and it was nothing serious. When he got interviewed about the penis stuff the school concluded that it was \u2018experimentation\u2019 that went a little too far. my reputation is trashed because of this and it\u2019s horrible that he can just get away with this but I know I hould\u2019ve said something when I was getting talked to.",

Teachers will flip the blame onto girls saying how it is our fault or try to say we are being aggressive or starting drama. I feel unsafe around boys in my year and i feel as if girls in our school are silenced.",

But now I\u2019m not because now I know it wasn\u2019t my fault. When I was in primary school I was heavily bullied and only really had one friend at the time. This friend was in almost all of my classes which wasn\u2019t an issue at the time really because well I thought she was my friend. She began being really creepy and obsessive later on that year, she would give me pens and pencils that she would boast about having fingered herself with, she would constantly grab at my private parts and play it off as \u2018a joke\u2019 but I knew it wasn\u2019t. Then we had swimming together and we had to change in front of our peers but she dragged me behind a wall on the other side of the changing rooms. She proceeded to touch me and grab at me and push me against the wall to hold me in place. She forced me down to feel at her parts and forced me to do very sexual things. She did this about 7 times and I never told anyone. She told me never to tell anyone anything because \u2018real friends keep secrets\u2019. I soon got her out of my life luckily and I could not be happier. But this was secondary school and bullying was so much worse. I told one of my friends who proceeded to belittle me and tell me \u2018that\u2019s not even a big deal if you\u2019re even telling the truth\u2019. I felt disgusted and ashamed and I just felt dirty. I felt that I couldn\u2019t get the feeling of her hands off of me. I felt like I could never be clean. From a young age I had been self harming and this only got worse. Just when I felt I was getting over it something happened again. I went out on my own late at night to go get myself a small drink and snack from the shops because I couldn\u2019t sleep and the corner shop didn\u2019t shut. When I was walking out I got pulled into this alleyway. This man pushed me against the wall and pinned me there. He touched me, groped me, he made me take his d*ck down my throat and almost r*ped me but I kicked him a lot in a final attempt to get away and I did. I ran for over an hour as he chased me and I finally got away. I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere ever. It\u2019s even harder because I\u2019m trans, and I feel like if I was just born a boy then there would be less of a chance this would happen to me. I feel like I will never be a boy because I was touched in that way. My mental health is incredibly bad but I\u2019m trying my best to work through it These experiences still haunt me and I feel that they always will but I won\u2019t let them control me",

We got on well but I made it clear to him I was not interested. He started hanging out with my flatmate as a way to get to me until she broke off their friendship when she realised he was using her.,Once, on a night out, he snuck up groped my breasts. I froze. He giggled and ran away. I left the club in tears and very angry. He then emailed me the next day telling me that he was sorry but he felt entitled to do this because I was a tease and he had liked me for ages and he was drunk and could we \"keep it between the two of us? That was the last straw and I threatened him with violence.,I showed the email to my close friends in our department. Only one girl really supported me in the way my flatmate had. Sadly, I found out that this was a pattern for this person - he had been harassing a woman who sat next to him before he moved on to me. He attempted the same thing with another close friend of mine but she shut him down very quickly - I had made a point of describing my experience with this man to as many colleagues as possible. With hindsight I wish I had taken it further.,It sounds insane to write this now, but It was only talking about my experiences years later with another group of friends that I actually realised I'd been victimised and sexually assaulted. At the time it never occurred me to report this to anyone - and if it had, I probably wouldn't have as I have little faith anything would be taken seriously. I have no idea if my university or funding body had a policy.,I've been a lot luckier than many of the women and girls posting on here - and how fucked up is that?!",

As one of the first serious relationships in our year it was almost forced that we hadn\u2019t had sex by the boys in our year. I felt some pressure to give myself up and just do it because all the boys would be like \u201cyou still haven\u2019t beat yet, it has only been 2 months\u201d. I was 14 at the time I wasn\u2019t ready for anything yet and I guess I put myself in that position because I got into a relationship. We clicked instantly we had the best chemistry and got on so well, so I trusted him and I trusted that what we did wasn\u2019t going to be told to anyone as it is private and I said to him please don\u2019t tell anyone I don\u2019t want anyone to know. I go to school on the Monday and people are coming up to me saying \u201chow was it\u201d before I had even spoken to him that day. I went straight to the toilets and cried because everyone was talking about it. During the relationship because we had done so much stuff earlier on I felt he would get bored of me and would try things I didn\u2019t want to do nor were ready to do. He would always ask let\u2019s try this and when I would be like \u201cI am not sure yet\u201d, he would move me and put me in that position anyway. Constantly during the relationship I would say no or not be in the mood to have sex and would feel like because I was in the relationship I had to do it. There was another time where he wanted to try something new and i wasn\u2019t sure and told him I am not sure, I told him please stop it is hurting pushing with all my force against his shoulder to get him away from me but he said \u201cI am in now I might as well carry on\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s just a bit of pain, do it for me\u201d. He would ask I can stop if you want me to but I knew from experiences before that with him that he would be grumpy or make me feel guilty. Another time was when I said no and he said \u201cwhen you say no it means yes\u201d, I said to him that this doesn\u2019t mean that and when I say no it means no. There was another when I wasn\u2019t in the mood and I think I had only said I wasn\u2019t in the mood and I probably didn\u2019t make it clear enough but that day he would put his whole body weight on me and I would struggle, I nearly cried and was in shock laying there on his bed while after he was done he just went to sleep. There were also multiple times when he would make me feels so guilty by saying \u201cI am so horny and you\u2019re my girlfriend you should want to have sex with me\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t like me anymore do you?\u201dand I would just feel like I had to give in and say fine just get it over with. There were times so that he didn\u2019t feel upset I would let him have sex with me and I would just tell myself it will be over soon. These are just a few times. When we got out of the relationship, I told a close friend what had happened she told me that is wasn\u2019t right and that I need to speak to someone about it, she was disgusted and she was the one who made me realise that what had happen to me was not right at all. When I think back to these times, my heart aches like it is now, IT ACTUALLY ACHES. I can\u2019t explain how I felt during the first lockdown I thought because no one believes or would believe me that I had to deal with the whole situation myself so I did. I cried every day and night, I cried whilst drifting off to sleep and this happened for about 2 months. I finally opened up to my mum and told her exactly what happened. I also opened up to friends who were and are friends with him and told them about what had happened to me. I didn\u2019t explain in depth because I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to as I thought that they would believe me straight away but I was wrong. I told the wrong person and then it got back to my ex. This then caused him and I to have a conversation where he admitted to himself and I that he had pressured me, but then till this day tells everyone the opposite making me feel and seem like a liar and someone who is doing this all for attention. After this conversation he went downstairs to the party where he had found out and this then started to speak to my friends and tell them that he didn\u2019t do anything to me. This was then left till the next weekend when I was at goose green with my new school friends and my friends who were still friends with him came along I specifically asked them to not bring him along, yet he proceeded to come along and then threatened me that he would come to my house and speak to my parents. He then told his mum and this caused my mum and his mum to have a phone call. His mum on the phone told me that I need to get over him and that I was still in love with him after my mum had told her what he had done to me. She then proceeded to tell my mum what drugs I had done and how I would be drunk a lot of the time (this was because I was so hurt and confused of why he would do things like that to me) as if it was part of the conversation almost to say I was in the wrong and I was asking for it. She also proceeded to say stuff about my mum and mine\u2019s relationship and stuff that I told her in private about my mum and how we didn\u2019t get along. It was almost like I was doing everything wrong and that I was in the wrong. A day later she photocopies all of the letters I had sent my ex and put them in a letter saying and wrote that I was a beautiful woman and that I should move on from him, making it out like I was in the wrong for ever accusing her son of doing that. Meanwhile all of my friends were choosing who to believe and this made me feel like I was nothing and what had happened to me was nothing. Eventually they asked me to \u201ctell the fully story then\u201d and \u201cexplain myself\u201d. They where either like \u201cit\u2019s bro code\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t pick a side because you\u2019re both my friends\u201d. I think that the most hurtful thing was that, my friends that I loved dearly not believing or trusting me. Things people have done/said to me who like and believe him: \u201cyou have ruined his life\u201d, ashed their blem on me, given me death stairs, laughed at me on the street, \u201cget out of our area\u201d. I feel like I can\u2019t tell my story because of how many people love him and trust him. It is the hardest thing to see someone who hurt you this live a happy life when you\u2019re not living a happy life and you are the victim. It\u2019s not only that he got away free and I will never be able to get away from what happened to me.",

It honestly could not have been a worse decision. The boys there treated girls like property, saying they had 'shotgunned' a girl so no one else could try to sleep with her, with no consideration for what the girl wanted at all. One of the boys there fingered a girl while she was passed out drunk , and everyone knew it had happened but just accepted it and didn't care. He was popular and no one ever called him out for sexual assault, and whenever someone did mention his behaviour was horrible the other boys would either make jokes about it or just try and excuse him by saying his parents just got a divorce. His name on their group chat was 'ruthless ravenous rapist' because he always targeted very drunk/ passed out girls and his friends thought it was hilarious. One night after a party we had all slept in a living room, and after falling asleep alone on the sofa, I woke up in the morning to find that same boys hands in my bra and in my pants, touching me while I slept and rubbing his boner into my back. I pretended I was waking up and he moved, and then I ran out and went home. I was so scared to think what would have happened if I hadn't woken up and left. I was too scared to tell people because they all thought it was just some big joke, and when I told my boyfriend at the time he said 'well thats just what he's like'. Another boy in the year above stole my phone and told me he had my nudes and he would send them round (even though there were none) and that he wouldn't give it back unless I went to his house alone. He only stopped when I started to cry and another boy told him to give it back. He also ripped my top off at a party, and grabbed me by the neck, forced vodka into my mouth and told me there would be 'trouble' if I hadn't got with him by the time he'd left the school.

I had parties most weekends and was drinking a lot because of this. With the number of parties my alcohol tolerance was increasing so I was starting to drink more at the parties. ,Come late September I'm going to a long awaited all nighter at a close friends with a group of about 20, it was gonna be a night to remember. I turn up early with another friend to help get the house setup as the host is working and we want to get everything ready to go. After a bit of prep me and the friend leave to get our drink and when we come back another has turned up early.,The friend who had just arrived was a long term friend from the beginning of high school. We had been in pe and a lot of other classes together throughout school, we were close and got on well. I even helped him with his head boy campaign. He saw us bringing a lot of drink to share between the three of us throughout the night (me, the host and the original helper). ,All was well and when people started turning up we started drinking. Needless to say after about an hour and a half I'm drunk. I'm about 2 litres of cider and half a liter of Jaeger in and well past the point of consent.,Feeling how drunk I am I go to lie down in the parents bedroom because even though they weren't there we were supposed to stay out and so it would be quiet in there. While I'm in there the friend who ran for head boy came in. He lay on top of me and started to kiss me. Never had I said I was gay, never had I even hinted at wanting to engage in anything with this boy but he saw me there, drunk and not in control, and decided, after years of commenting on my body in changing rooms, that he wanted to do something with me.,I was frightened and instead of fight, flight or freeze, my body chose to appease. I never showed intent but I went along with what he wanted out of fear. Even if I had initiated it, he was very slightly tipsy and I was almost blackout, I was in no position to consent.,Skip forward a few hours and I was going up to a room where the few who wanted sleep were lying down to rest. Not wanting to disturb anyone I lie down on the floor next to the door and again he brings himself across and lies on top of me. Due to the layout of the room no one can see us even if they're awake, and he knows this. He starts kissing me again, this time I freeze. I do nothing. I just simply lie there.,He kisses me for what feels like forever before deciding this isn't enough for him. He pulls down my jeans and starts trying to give me a hand job but I'm not hard. He can't do anything with that so instead of deciding to stop he instead takes my hand and puts it on him, moving my hand himself while I lie there unmoving. After he's decided he's had enough fun he rolls off me and goes back to lie in the corner, leaving me lying on the floor unsure of what to do.,A week later at a smaller gathering without him present I break down and a couple friends take me to a room to talk to me, that's the first time i learn about another time that night. While I was blacked he had taken me into a room and had me pressed against a wall kissing me, the girl that walked in didn't realise anything was wrong at the time but it scares me to think what might have happened.,Thankfully when I told the school they kept him off school until things were in place to keep us separate. He was never out with my friend group again and those that knew what happened were very supportive. But I fear I am a rare happy case, it took a lot to speak to someone about what happened, and even afterwards there was nothing I could really do unless I wanted to spend the next 2 years of my life going through a court system trying to get him charged.,Even whilst he was gone there was still people giving me funny looks and spreading rumours about what happened, school was not fun.,A year and a half on I'm recovering and while I may have an occasional dip I've been to counseling and have put the majority of it in my past, I am moving on and better for it.",

The party started to calm down and I really fancied this boy, so I decided to sleep outside in my sleeping bag to be nearer him. The girls were in a tent together, where I probably should have been, but I was curious. Then out of the blue 2 older boys came to the party, they were drunk and had been clubbing and they thought they'd pass by and see what was going on. One of the 17 year old boys threw himself on me in my sleeping bag and kissed me, I was trapped. He then fondled me and I felt violated. He then told me to get out of the sleeping bag and go with him. He said he'd seen me around school and thought I was fit. I was very scared as I thought if I protest this he will make a scene and all my friends were in a tent, the lads were younger so didn't want to speak up. I went with him and he got me to lie down and rubbed himself all over me. We walked back up to the tent and he asked me to get in a tent with him, they had removed the lads sleeping in there. I didn't want to get in so I stayed crouched near the tent, feeling scared and afraid. He grabbed my arm several times to get me to go in with him. After many attempts I went into the tent as I was afraid he would make a scene. He then lay me down and raped me, I was a lot of pain and felt that I wasn't in my own body. He did this whilst his friend looked on. I left the tent and walked home, I felt so alone, my parents grounded me as they knew I'd been out at a party and I was bullied at school as rumours started to spread that I was easy. It affected my confidence for the rest of my life and I have been in and out of counselling. I didn't tell any family until I was 22. I did manage to do well in my career and have a family but I never reported it as I always thought I would be blamed for being out and encouraging it when I was a very scared, niave 14 year old young girl.",

Any normal person would stop doing it as it would be uncomfortable for them, as their knees are literally on someone\u2019s bum. I know I would anyways. Like in assembly for example in those tiktoks where your knees touch the others persons and u instantly move it as ur uncomfortable. It was this but his knees on my bum. It would stay like this until the teacher was done talking and I turned around. I would shift forward a bit and he would stop for a bit only to do it again in a few mins. Then it was him \u2018dropping\u2019 his pen and it always landed in front of my stool (chair) .instead of him kicking it out with his foot like any normal person, he would put his head down all the way so it was right at my crotch or thighs. He ALWAYS dropped his pen and ALWAYS done this. One day when we were marking our exam, he went up to the teacher to try and get extra marks for something he thought he should\u2019ve gotten the mark for.

So I told them how it was affecting me and most of them were very supportive but a few of my guy friends who are also friends with him kept just telling me to move on and get over it, but I can't until I know he will stop doing it to others aswell so I took him aside at break and tried to tell him my side and what he had done but he denied it all and said he did absolutely nothing wrong and that I was a horrible person because I had gone around telling everyone that he had raped me which I never did and he doesn't see how wrong it is. So my friend showed him this website and he said it made him less sympathetic because he thought most of us were lying and now I am just stuck knowing that he will never change and everytime I go to my best friends house I see where it happened and get reminded.",

I was extremely shy and nervous as I was new at the school and didn\u2019t have much confidence. I was also experiencing bullying not long after this - it seemed that these two boys saw it as easy as it was quite clear to my class that this teacher seemed to not like me. These boys were loud and would try to aggravate people and they would make sexual comments all the time or show pictures of porn on their phone during the chemistry class. These boys used to grab my butt and when I was trying to sit down they would try and quickly lift my skirt. They used to make comments about the category of porn I should be in and would also tell me to shut up if I tried to complain. They used to also mix this alongside picking on me about my hair and making fun of me trying to say that I\u2019m poor and stuff like that. This teacher would allow them to do all of these things. And then months down the line this teacher decided that she wanted to create a seating plan and she put everyone else on a couple of tables and then made one small table only with these boys that were sexually harassing, assaulting and bullying me and with me as the only girl in the middle of them. When I spoke to her about why she had done that as she knows they bully me and she said it\u2019s because she found it entertaining. I still feel a bit upset and let down when I think about the way some teachers at this school were allowed to act there was so much unprofessional behaviour by teachers that this just seemed like it was allowed and that teachers could do what they want because they think it\u2019s fun or funny. Even allowing a child to be bullied and sexually assaulted and watching it for months. And weirdly enough, these boys were never told off or told to stop at all. There were too many incidents especially from the science block of teachers, there needs to be culture change at this school and teachers need to stop perpetuating bullying or sexual abuse and rape culture as at least from my experience at this school the teachers made things worse especially for girls that were shy or timid or lacked confidence in themselves to do anything about it.",

Despite telling the college about the behaviour, furnishing them with screenshots and telling them the names of people who had witnessed the behaviour, the promises of action were not followed through despite my daughter\u2019s mental health deteriorating as the stalking continued despite the boy being warned. The head of safeguarding even told my daughter she was concerned about ruining the boy\u2019s life chances if they excluded him and asked my daughter how she would feel about that and was it what she wanted, she was made to feel that by complaining she was being malicious. She was also told they felt she was exaggerating her distress at the situation as she had been seen laughing with her friends. This was said to her as she was sobbing. No follow up took place and my daughter has been left with no confidence in the structures meant to support her. The safeguarding staff member who dealt with the initial calls when this started avoids eye contact with my daughter in the corridor. We feel that the college has not only failed my daughter but missed an opportunity to intervene in the boy\u2019s life before he escalates.

Majority of the times we would try to stop them, we would get scolded for being a distraction or disrupting the flow of the class/school. From middle school to high school, the same people would joke about touching others inappropriately. Some have reported these people but they have gotten nothing but a slap on the wrist. Thankfully we\u2019re still remotely learning, because me along with others know they would still continue to act this way if we weren\u2019t. 12 to 14, those two years were filled with so much confusion on whether it was my fault, if it was normal, if it was ok for this to happen.

But throughout this relationship there were times where I wanted to keep it non sexual, or I wasn\u2019t ready to do anything more than kissing. I was only 13. But he would say it was fine but when in the moment during kissing, he\u2019d say to me \u2018you\u2019ve got to give me a bj because i hate how you leave me with blue balls.\u2019 Naive as I was, I thought that was the worst thing possible and that what he was saying was what I needed to do. So I was manipulated into doing sexual things for him in case he would get angry at me for leaving him like in that state. In hindsight now in a better relationship, I realise how manipulative he was and how I was used for his own benefit. One time we were making out and he asked me if we could have sex (no condoms and out of the blue), bear in mind i was still 13 and he was nearly 15. Thankfully I persistently said no, but because I said no he went and sought that elsewhere and ended up cheating on me because I wasnt ready for sex. To this day its rewired my mental state and has taken me so long to revert how me saying no will not equate in someone leaving or cheating on me. He would always make me feel as though I was incompetent and wrong and that if i didnt fulfil his needs, that he would just go and find a girl who would. He made me believe that that was normal boy behaviour.",

        "body": "My all boys' school had a rape culture that was endemic throughout the school and it often felt like teachers condoned it and even encouraged it. Male teachers would tell us 'not to play hockey like women drive' and that women were there to 'make steak and give us blowjobs'. When I was on a school trip when I was 14, I heard two male teachers talk about which female teachers on the trip they'd have sex with in graphic detail and how they'd discussed this with some of the male students on the trip. Female students in the sixth form were told to not wear 'sexually revealing clothes' because it would give younger male students 'the wrong idea' and 'distract them while they were learning'. One science lesson, two boys who sat behind me described in graphic detail how they were going to rape my mum and my sister, I found it so distressing that after everyone left the lesson I stayed in my seat and burst into tears, the male teacher didn't know how to react and after I explained to him what happened, there didn't appear to be any repercussions and no one spoke to me about it again. As a young gay man who wasn't out, I didn't feel like there was any support for me and my experience only made me feel more shame towards my sexuality and gender expression. Sexual assault was so common I would never have even considered what I experienced assault until the last year, or so, when I've started to reflect more on what happened. One male student forced me over a table and started humping me, he was much bigger than me and I was scared he was going to rape me and only stopped when another student told him to. The same male student would often corner me and offer me money to perform sexual favours which I refused. I stopped going to my PE lessons because male students would grope me and harass me. When my sisters were attending the mixed sixth form at the school, the boys forced every girl to walk through a line of chairs in the common room and rated them from 1-10. This all happened in a general culture of misogyny and homophobia, where slurs like 'pussy' 'faggot', 'batty' and 'bender' were just an accepted part of your existence. I know there are some people who struggle to believe that the words and actions I've described translate into bigger things, but they do. My female friends were raped, harassed and assaulted by the same boys who bullied me. I won't go into detail on those instances because those are not my stories to tell. It often felt like the school was complicit in these actions, we never had any assemblies or education about misogyny, assault, harassment, homophobia or other forms of discrimination and I can't believe they were ignorant to the fact that misogyny and homophobia were so widespread. I believe the school's sports culture encouraged this sort of behaviour, the PE department would describe themselves as 'bantanomo bay' and I was made to run a race, which your place in determined your PE set, without any socks on because I had 'the wrong colour socks' and by the end, my feet were blistered and bleeding. I'm in my early 20s now and still experience trauma from my time at school.",

Some months went by, my friend and her boyfriend had broken up. A few weeks after that I saw one of his friends in this place we call \u201cthe bridge\u201d I was in there for practicing my reading and writing as I am dyslexic. He came and sat on my table which was empty other than me , after a while and we both said hi but nothing more and this happened for about two weeks after. Then one day I get a text message on Instagram from this person and for the his privacy I\u2019ll call him James. James had told me that he got my Instagram handle from my friends ex. I had no problem with this as James seemed quite nice and I didn\u2019t think he had any bad intentions. After a few days we starting messaging more until eventually he asked me for my Snapchat which was probably the first red flag because he told me he didn\u2019t use Snapchat because he deleted his account. As soon as the conversation was moved to Snapchat I noticed a change in his behaviour, both over text and in person. He would ask me inappropriate things and he would ask what I was doing before school, during my breaks and after school and every time I made up an excuse because I didn\u2019t know him well enough to go and meet him. When I would ask why , he would make inappropriate comments about me and my body and say that he wanted to do this or that to me and how and go into detail. And as I am already a rape survivor I was creeped out by this behaviour and immediately told my older sister who was in the year above James. After she found out she got me to stop talking to him and to block him. But it didn\u2019t end there. As my sister was in year 11 she was going in early to her interventions so i was going with her as my mum didn\u2019t want me to walk to school by myself. However when we would get to the gates, him and one of his friends would already be there walking up , I never knew why they were there so early as well but I knew some kids just turned up early. When we were walking up James would always turn around and stare at us, making faces and then turning to his friend and laughing. I didn\u2019t think it could get much worse than that until he started coming up to me in school and asking the same questions and this time trying to get me to go with him then. Once again I refused but James never gave up. After a while it calmed down to the point where I started to think that maybe he would leave me alone. That was until I was walking into the inclusion area to go take some medication, I didn\u2019t know he was coming out and I bumped into him as I wasn\u2019t looking where I was going, of course I apologised but it wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He tried to grab my arms to force me to go to the toilets with him but at the same time the first aid teacher who gives me my medication walked out of her office and he immediately stopped as she spoke to me. I never told anyone that happened and my sister still doesn\u2019t know to this day. It took me almost a whole year of all this going on to actually tell a safeguarding teacher about it. They looked through all the messages and took my side of of what happened and as James had already left the school they didn\u2019t do anything. Then when I was in year 10 And i was in what we call the \u201cplc\u201d (personal learning centre) and I turned around as the teacher had called my name for something and as I turned around , James walked in, instantly I felt fearful and anxious. After the lesson, I went and spoke to the deputy head who was also and designated safeguarding lead (DSL), I told her what had happened as she was one of the treachery who looked through the messages and she just said \u201cnothing is going to happen, stop being silly and overreacting \u201d and in that moment I started crying, I walked away and realised that the school didn\u2019t care. They never did and I was going to have to get through it in my own. 2 years later and I\u2019m now in college, I\u2019ve spoken to James since the situation and he seems to be different and he\u2019s doing good I think. He has apologised which is something I never thought I\u2019d get from him so I was surprised. But I just hope no one in that school has to experience what I did and the teachers not care about it.",

That day I was eating lunch, he came up to me and started telling me what to do and acting like a domme. I told him to stop but he continued to do it. He then push me against the wall and put his hands down my pants. I yelled stop, but still he did it. I ended up leaving my food and running away from him. I cut off all ties, and completely ignored him for my last year of school.",

At 17, after a failed attempt to be coerced into sex, I was orally raped by a boy in the year below me. At 18 being violently vaginally and anally raped by a 20 year old whilst blackout drunk at a party. If I dig deeper, I remember more. Being forced to go swimming naked at an inappropriate age. Being catcalled by men on the street as I walked home in my school uniform. Being groomed online at 12 in the guise of a modelling agent to solicit \u2018sexy\u2019 pictures. Being told I had \u2018blow job\u2019 lips and asked for pics by boys at school. The time I was backed up into a wall and aggressively kissed and groped by a 40 year old stranger in a club. The time I resurfaced out of a k-hole go find myself having sex with someone, who I proceeded to get into a casual relationship with. When two days after I was anally raped, drunk and upset, a guy who was supposed to be consoling me ended up having sex with me and tried to instigate anal. When a month later I confronted him and he replied \u201coh that was definitely on purpose- I have a thing for anal when I\u2019m drunk\u201d. Times I had slept next to good friends at house parties and been felt up without consenting to it.

I knew they where peers and in our year as I recognised the girl from hanging out with her a couple years prior I didn\u2019t know any of the guys though. So I just thought they might be a bit loud but ultimately harmless. BUT NO. They started off loud but then started laughing and I could feel my chair being kicked and it just felt bad, I didn\u2019t know this at the time but they where scratching and touching my friend. Ripping stuff up being loud and obnoxious. Then they started chanting MY NAME and then my friends name then singing a song about how my area smells like fish. My friend has somewhat severe social anxiety so they just freezed up and that\u2019s fine because for them it\u2019s a literal living nightmare. I didn\u2019t retort I didn\u2019t even turn around I mainly just felt this burning pit in my stomach and I\u2019m really bad at confrontation and they probably wanted some kind of retort. I just felt violated mainly due to we couldn\u2019t get off early because we where going over a large area known to be somewhat dangerous and I was unfamiliar with. And I just felt as though my boundaries have been crossed big time. I never expected to be a victim of this level of sexual harassment in public let alone on a bus with my friend. And to know people will try and humiliate you in a place jammed full of adults who don\u2019t even know your name or that it was targeted at me or my friend is the most scary thing. I never reported because I just don\u2019t feel like it and I don\u2019t feel like ruining their job prospects with a harassment case. Even though I could because our busses have cameras everywhere nothing could get by them.

The first time it was december. He begged and begged me to have sex with him and I REALLY did not want to because I just wasn\u2019t in the mood. I made excuses after excuses and said I was sick but he still kept begging. He pulled the back of my trousers and underwear down and began to attempt to fuck me. I kept saying I didn\u2019t want to and I kept saying stop but he didn\u2019t listen and I just stayed silent until he stopped. I picked my stuff up afterwards and went home crying on the tube. I didn\u2019t properly process the fact that this was rape until later so I carried on talking to him probably because I was infatuated. It then happened again in January while he\u2019s just gotten back together with his girlfriend but it was so so much worse. When I spoke out about it he told everyone that I\u2019d lied about it, I felt so alone and isolated I attempted to take my life. Because of this event I now have substance abuse issues and extreme diagnosed PTSD. I know he\u2019s done this to other people and it\u2019s time for it to stop.",

I was cornered in classrooms, pressured to send nudes and threatened that if I didn't he would find them or take them himself and distribute all round the school and all social media platforms. He sent me unsolicited nudes and said I then owed him the same in return. This kind of behaviour carried on for 3 months. In lessons he would put his hand on my upper thigh and try put his hand up my skirt making me visibly uncomfortable. In locker rooms he would do the same as well as trying to put his hands in my shirt and bra, physically restraining my hand if I tried to move it away or stop him. He even went as far as slapping me across the face if I disrespected him. I came in to school multiple times with bruises on my arms and legs that he forced me to cover up with uniform. He would make public comments about the size of my chest in-front of other pupils and even teachers. If I ever mentioned leaving him he would threaten to kill himself and I received multiple texts saying he was about to commit suicide if I didn't send images of a sexual nature. When I refused he would send all kinds of threats and that it would all be my fault if he killed himself and he would make sure everyone knew that. He said multiple times if I went to the school he would turn it round on me and I would get kicked out. When I did leave him I told a friend what had happened and was strongly advised to talk to a teacher. I went to the head of pastoral care and told them everything that had happened. All though I did not have evidence to back up everything I could prove the main things and knew the school had cameras to prove other things along with witness statements from friends and teachers to further prove this. The school sat me in a room and told me they could not do anything. They did not check any CCTV footage, they did not look at my evidence and they did not talk to any of my friends. Instead, they told said I could go the the police if I wanted but I would have to stand in front of people and tell everyone what 'I' had done and how badly it would reflect on me and I would have to be stood in front of him the whole time. I was asked multiple times if I had done anything to lead him on or provoke him and every time I said no I was meant with 'Are you sure?' 'It's ok if you didn't mean to.' They never took into consideration how it affected me and continues to do so to this day, and this time of my life will stay with me forever, affecting all my relationships since and having nightmares about the experience I had which school have done nothing to help with or rectify.

Having gone to a girls\u2019 school all my life, I was so na\u00efve and had no self-esteem so I believed the things he said and accepted the abuse because he made me feel it was what I deserved.

The impact with a corner against my stomach hurt so badly that I can\u2019t remember how many minutes I was lying in pain on the ground for.

He would comment on my appearance every single day, telling me I was ugly and how I had to straighten my hair because he wasn\u2019t attracted to me with my natural hair. He criticised every part of my body, leaving my cripplingly insecure. He told me he was so disgusted that he didn\u2019t want to look at me on days where I had acne on my face. Getting pimples became my worst fear because of the abuse I knew I\u2019d get, and I\u2019d try to scratch them off my face to the point of scarring to protect myself from it. He said that I should be so grateful that he allowed me to have sex with him. He forced me to block other boys who showed interest in me, and the one time we hung out with other people \u2013 his friends who didn\u2019t know anyone from our school \u2013 he groped me and forcibly fingered me under the table in front of them to assert his claim over me as I engaged in conversation with one of them. He made me feel so ashamed about the sexual nature of the relationship, he constantly called me a slut for doing the things he asked me to do. He waited until just before my A level exams to dump me and tell me that he had only used me for sex and that the entire time he had manipulated me and taken advantage of the fact I liked him. He said he chose to dump me at that time because I was already extremely stressed and reeling from other personal losses, and so he wanted to be the one to send me to rock bottom. At the time, I felt so dirty and corrupt that I couldn\u2019t bring myself tell anyone about what he did to me. I stayed silent out of fear of his threats against me if I ever spoke out. And even if I did, I was terrified that information would get passed around the school and, as the girl, I\u2019d take the blame for being a whore, and while he\u2019d be respected by his friends for playing a girl so brutally and gaining sexual experience I\u2019d be seen as untouchable damaged goods.

If I wore a brightly coloured sports bra so that my shirt fit I'd be told off for showing my underwear. Similar incidents occured to me and other students where female teachers (most no longer at the school) would ask what boys or male teachers we were trying to impress by literally wearing regulation uniform, further aiding the idea that women are responsible for the sexualisation of their bodies. Our year 7,8 and 9 PSHE teaches that assault is bad, consent is saying yes clearly and how to use a condom. Then its over. But its those early years where teachers, often female teachers reinforce the idea that your body is a sexual object and this translates to the feeling of responsibility that prevents reporting.,I distinctly remeber such comments being made abt going to impress the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with my cleavge or whatever coming from female teachers, which left me feeling incredibly low abt a part of my body I had no control over and hence I wld dress for it, only to have my bum and breasts grabbed outside [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] station after a gig, leading me to react in the exact opposite way and yet I still get catcalled constantly when literally wearing trackies and a tshirt on a journey to school.

I was an attention seeking, lying slut, who cried rape because I couldn\u2019t take regrets. So I\u2019ve started this sixth form, and instantly I have guys asking if because I\u2019m \u201ceasy\u201d, will I take their virginities, and will I do stuff with them in the bathrooms. I\u2019d walk down a hallway and have people literally mutter \u201cwhore\u201d under their breath, believing I wouldn\u2019t hear. I dated someone for three weeks, and it only lasted for three weeks because his friends couldn\u2019t stand him dating ME. His friends all sent me extremely inappropriate messages, which he is unaware of, asking how far we\u2019d gone and if I\u2019d go further with them, and how they\u2019d make me or tell him I\u2019d sent them \u201cpictures\u201d. We ended up breaking up after an argument about my ex, who assaulted me repeatedly, where his friends told me I was a slut and wouldn\u2019t respect him if he got back with me, or even stayed friends with me. This carried on, and only got worse to the point where I\u2019d wear a skirt or skinny jeans to school, and my thigh gap got commented on to the point where I deliberately stopped exercising and eating more crappy food to get rid of it, especially when one guy balled up his fist to see if he could fit it in between my thighs under a table. When I tried speaking about it, I\u2019d already been painted as a \u201cliar\u201d, simply because of claims I\u2019d made strongly about my ex who raped me, and people were friends with him. Nobody would listen, and I was alone. There was a school trip to New York, which I went on. Whilst I was on the coach, I got a message saying how much one of the boys wished he could\u2019ve gone and shared a room with me, just so he could get some \u201chot, sleeping arse\u201d. He vividly described what he\u2019d do to me once I fell asleep, which tainted the trip. Lockdown obviously happened, and I was the end of several jokes - people would screenshot pictures off my Instagram, zoom in on my cleavage and rate it, saying what they\u2019d like to do. I knew I couldn\u2019t carry on in this year group, and so I petitioned my school to drop a year group, to bring my grades up.

It just goes to show how influenced children are by this toxic culture that surrounds us. That boy was also the first person to grope me without consent. I felt awful and embarrassed about it for a very long time. My primary school was full of boys harassing girls, whether physically or verbally, including saying the most inappropriate, sexual things about them in front of them or behind their backs. I personally felt very uncomfortable around lots of the boys in our year once I reached puberty. It\u2019s awful to think that this sort of behaviour was happening from the age of 9, but at the time it was completely accepted and laughed off by the girls. Education about this sort of harassment needs to happen earlier, as the mindset of being entitled to women\u2019s bodies is ingrained in boys at such a young age.

The boys would slap or grab my butt in the hallways and would always ask me for nudes iver text. The kid who started touching me was also the first guy to ask me for nudes. I told him I didn\u2019t do that and i didn\u2019t want to get in trouble or show him anything iver and over again. he wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. He told me he was going to ruin my life and i believed him. he was a bad kid and had friends who could easily hurt me. i just did what he said and tried not to make a big deal. i sent him a booty pic and he sent it around the school. from that day on my life was over. every guy started texting me and asking me for nudes and if i said no, they threaten to send the other picture around and tell other people super bad rumors about me. My friends knew about this and saw the guys always grabbing my butt in class. They told me i should report it to the principal or a teacher. I went down to the office and reported it and they told me it was probably just nothing and said \u201cboys are immature that\u2019s what they do\u201d I was sick of it and the kid got away with it. the next year, i had a close friend group and one of the guys who i thought was my friend, ruined my whole life. He was addicted to porn and a super creepy guy. When we first started \u201cdating\u201d i had been on vacation and he told all my friends that me and him were dating. All my friends texted me and asked me if it was true and i was shocked and texted the kid immediately. I asked him why and he said that he wanted nudes and that he really liked me sk he assumed we were dating and told everyone that. He was diabetic and so when i told my friends i didn\u2019t want to be with him they made me feel like a jerk bc they told me i didn\u2019t wanna date him bc he was diabetic and i felt bad. This kid had forced me to hnagout with him and forced me to pay him and forced everything. I got attached bc he manipulated me. On new year\u2019s eve, (going into 2020) He planned to have sex with me and when all of my friends pushed me into the bathroom where he was i told him i didn\u2019t want to and he forced me to have sex with him. i didn\u2019t tell anyone until August 2020. When I did tel my story, nobody believed me and i lost everyone. not even the school did anything. the police did nothing",

In year 10 several of my friends older boyfriends forced them into having sex with them, which we only realised and understood years later was rape. Throughout my whole time at this school I was pressured into nudes by older boys, sexual acts by boyfriends, groped, objectified and not one adult said anything about the boys behaviour but instead put it on the girls behaviour.

When we started dating it was just before we ended year 11, he didn\u2019t talk to me much at school but I didn\u2019t make mad to much because I was too busy with my friends anyway. After our last day of school the relationship properly started, he took me on the most amazing dates and would never let me pay even when I tried to pay when he wasn\u2019t looking I thought it was the best relationship as we had been friends for 3 years and always sort of flirted with eachother he met my family and it was going well but I noticed few things like he always seemed to get looks of snaps from girls and would say \u2018she won\u2019t stop sending me nudes\u2019 but never blocked her or told her to stop. He started to text a girl that he talked to a few months before we started going out and he would talk to her when I wouldn\u2019t do \u201cthings\u201d with him. He broke up with me over text at a motive in a field and left me with no way home while I was blackout drunk. The next day we got back together because he said \u2018you don\u2019t give me enough \u201caffection\u201d\u2019 and I believed it was my fault. He started fingering me when I didn\u2019t want him to and then when we started having sex stoped taking me out. I couldn\u2019t feel much so I pretended and even when I didn\u2019t want to would feel like I had to and would think \u2018well I can\u2019t really feel it anyway so I should just do it\u2019 he started becoming more aggressive and hurt me a few times without meaning to. I\u2019ve had bad past relationship and carried bit of trauma so I was nervous to give oral, but he would say \u2018if I don\u2019t force you, you won\u2019t do it\u2019 and would always push my head down or put it in front of my face and try to force me to put it in my mouth. He always tried to make our like he was giving me anything and I wasn\u2019t giving anything back and he deserved me to get over it and just do it. The time that has affected me the most was when the euros was on, I was celebrating with my family and he asked me to come over I was drunk but I was at the football club and he lives 2 minutes away so I went. He convinced me to have sec that night when I didn\u2019t want to but I said he had to wear a condom as I missed my pill 2 days ago and it takes two days of not missing be protected, he told me he was going to put it on and when to the bathroom and then come back. He didn\u2019t wear a condom and I got pregnant. I didn\u2019t find out till a week before my prom, I had an infection in my leg and the tested me as I hadn\u2019t gotten my period and the prescription. I was 7 weeks pregnant and my then boyfriend was away for over 3 weeks to see his dad and visit his home country. It was also a week before my school prom and I was panicking, I didn\u2019t tell anyone because I was angry at myself that I was so weak to allow all this to happen to me. On my prom night he cheated on me and posted this girl all over his insta to make my night about him. I broke up with him the next day as I saw it a 3 in the morning. I was scared and stressed out about what I was going to do. A couple of days later I went to my best friends house to try to cheer me up I had a metallic taste in my mouth, like coins but more irony, and had a bad feeling I was getting terrible stomach pains and heavy bleeding and I had no idea what to do because I still hadn\u2019t told anyone I tried to pretend to was ok and I was just my period and nothing else. My best friend at the time dragged me to the gym so I could take my mind off him. Anyway later I was at my Nanna\u2019s for her birthday and to stay for a while and this is when my best friend decided to start an argument I didn\u2019t want one and I was trying to mediate it but after a while I just snapped all the trauma I was burying came out in a burst of anger And I said things I really shouldn\u2019t have and I\u2019m so sorry for that. When I went back to school me and the guy had spoken after he had shown up at my work and we decided we were going to be civil as we were going to be in sixth form together. I also told him about the miscarriage as he needed to know I wasn\u2019t pregnant he shouted while following me down the road as we live only afew minutes away from eachother. He spread around the school the other was all my fault that I had a miscarriage and that I cheated on him. The school didn\u2019t do anything, they told people to stop gossiping about it but didn\u2019t talk to him. A few week of this still going on the help a poorly presented assembly about sexual assault which made it worse. I tried to have a real but I just don\u2019t feel safe anymore and i cant have a guy touch me or have sex because it scares me and I have flashbacks. It\u2019s been a few months but I still feel numb and think about the miscarriage every night and I don\u2019t think u will ever be fully over it. I so badly want to press charges and go to the police because I fell like I would be being selfish if I didn\u2019t to help others but most cases get rejected because there\u2019s insufficient evidence or no one believes you, so I\u2019m not sure if I can\u2019t do it yet as I\u2019m still not over the loss.

I was in year 10 and a boy who had recently came back to the school after leaving came to speak to me. Me and this guy were school friends but outside of school we would just say hi and that\u2019s it. He was outgoing everyone knew him and he was actually Immature asf tbh he was like a child like his mindset was so childish. He didn\u2019t have any special needs btw . Anywahs so I had an English lesson and I asked the teacher to go to the toilet. As I was leaving into the coridoor I saw the boy. He was excited to see me after such a long time and came close to me. He then literally grabbed my wrists and pushed me against the wall IN THE CORIDOOR OPENLY and was so close to me literally chest to chest. I was so uncomfortable to the point where I was red and laughing KEEp in mind I\u2019m Asian so GOINF red isn\u2019t that noticeable. He literally wouldnt let go off me and was holding my arms so tight and he was SO CLOSE TO Me like I couldn\u2019t feel his breath when he was talking. He wouldn\u2019t let go after I kept saying move and stop until I kneed him and ran to one of my friends. I literally felt so nasty because why would he even do that knowing I wear hijab and that I\u2019ve never shown interest in him. I felt like he had a crush on me anyways because of the way he would always approach me and try to speak to me and complement me even after this situation. My friend who\u2019s outgoing once told him to fuck off and leave me alone because she could see how obsessed he was getting and how uncomfortable and annoyed I was getting with it. I remember a guy in mt year walking past and staring because the sight actually looked so weird he was pinning me to a wall and I was laughing but because I\u2019ve never felt that uncomfortable in my life and the feeling I had when I ran away was actually traumatic. When I tell my friend s they\u2019re so used to being sexualised that they probably didn\u2019t think it was deep but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never forgotten and EVERYTIME I see him I pray he doesn\u2019t come up to talk to me.

Before we started dating it was not unusual for a guy to show that he liked you by grabbing your breasts or bottom, both which I had experienced, it even went as far as him putting his hand in between my legs as I was walking upstairs. Bearing in mind this all took place down school corridors in the open, nothing was ever said by the teachers to explain why this was wrong. In sex ed we were educated on contraception, sexual orientation, masturbation and the hardships of parenthood. We were never told about consent and healthy relationships. I wasn't educated on how to react when my boyfriend told me he had a dream one night of how he would force himself on me. (Something he had seen in pornography),As a young girl who had never really seen porn, I never really knew how I was expected to act, or how extreme these boys wanted to take things. He would sexually assault me, and I didn't even know it. When he did rape me, I struggled to come to terms with it, I always thought rape would be violent, involving punches and hands held down. But this was coercion. He invited me into his bedroom, and simply would not take no as an answer, he would keep asking me until I gave in and said 'OK'. He didn't stop when I laid there silently and clearly was not enjoying the experience.,Although he raped me, which I will never be able to forgive him for, I do feel a sense of pity towards him.,Afterwards, he knew it felt wrong because I didn't react in the way a woman would in consensual intercourse. He told me he spoke to his male friend about it, and was comforted because his friend said he did nothing wrong. I too spoke to my girl friends about the experience and how empty and lost I felt, I was told this was normal and to simply get over it.,Everyone was on his side because I said 'OK'. All of us didn't understand that pressuring someone to agree to something is not consent.,I even told my strict parents about what happened because if it was consensual, why did I feel so dirty? Although disappointed in me for having sex outside marriage, my parents also never said to me that what happened was wrong.,It was 2 years after it happened, chronically depressed and in therapy when my therapist explained to me that I had been raped.,There is a serious lack of understanding of consent and coercion, and I believe that there are thousands of people who have been raped and not known it, simply because they had not been educated about it. And more seriously, the perpetrators have not been educated that this is wrong.,I think there needs to be a service outside the police for people who question if they have raped someone, or questions what they have done is wrong. Because I feel that if this service was available, I do think my rapist would have spoken to them and got the help he needed, and so would have I.",

This sadly was not an isolated incident as it was followed up by more sexual harassment from a group of his friends. This included being publicly shamed for being sexually abused as well as cornering me in a nightclub and discussing my private and traumatic sexual experiences out loud, commenting on my body and why this boy did what he did. In addition to this a friend and I were told to take our tops off and expose our private areas to a group of boys at a house party that year, whereby I felt extremely intimidated as I was one of the only girls left at the party. It took a whole load of confidence from me to stand up to them and leave. To say this probably the most embarrassing thing I have ever experienced is a huge understatement, not only to be treated like a sexual object but also to justify why I deserved to be sexually abused.

One time, we were in a car with a few of the in-country teachers on the way to a bar. At this point, we had a few drinks already. It was a squeeze in the car, so I had to sit on one of the in-country teachers lap. I was a little bit awkward about it, but I tried not to dwell too much. Then he kept putting his hand up my dress, even when I told him it made me feel weird. That night, I argued with him and he told the rest of the girls on the trip. The most hurtful thing was that they told ME that I needed to apologise to him. I told them what he did, but they immediately brushed it off. I wasn't terribly affected by it, but that's because shit like that happens all the time. I'm so used to men trying to grope me that it's starting to seem normal. That's the hardest thing.",

It\u2019s quite a blur but has never left me, through therapy I have been able to understand how that situation (and the public ridicule and total lack of understanding I faced over the coming weeks of school) was the beginning of years of depression, the start of my anxiety which I still deal with now and a 7 year long eating disorder which I have only just been able to break free from. Not only are these situations traumatic at the time, but my life has been changed ever since. I am now 21 and still find the male figure and it\u2019s presence in credibly hard to feel comfortable and safe around. Recently I was sexually abused again, by a university friend who was staying the night. We had kissed briefly in the evening leading up to it but I had changed my mind and clearly vocalised that to him, he didn\u2019t want to hear it. In fact he was completely unable to hear anything I had to say, and created his own crazy narrative about how we have an \u2018appreciation\u2019 for each other. We did not. That night whilst I slept he continuously made passes at me and tried to touch (with success) whilst I lay next to him wishing I could run away or scream or do anything that would get him to stop. This event caused me to spiral, quite dramatically and my bulimia came back after I had made so much progress. I understand now that these two men have changed my life forever. This is rape culture. Silently asking my tutor if I could move out of his group rather than have him confronted by his mistakes is rape culture.

The weeks following he bragged to everyone that we slept together and I denied it and told everyone he was lying but never told anyone the truth, and everyone including my girlfriend would just called me a liar and asked why I\u2019m so easy etc. Of course the guy I liked believed him and never spoke to me again.

At the time the police were contacted but did nothing at all, to the point I don't even think they spoke to him.

I later found out that the same person had sent unsolicited dick pics to nearly every single girl in my year group and probably beyond. A few years later I was groped by a childhood friend in a classroom, no teacher was present but at the time this person thought that was okay - there has never been any sort of sexual relationship between us and nothing to justify this. This past year I have been beeped at or shouted at when I've been out for a walk alone more times than not, no matter what time of day it is. When I was 12, a boy who was 14 or 15 at the time hassled me to the point I asked my friend to come with me where he was so I didn't have to do it alone. I know countless stories from other girls who have experienced similar things to me and we are 16. The boys in my year group were allowed to get away with it all. ,When I went to report my own assault I was reluctant to say who it was and the member of staff told me that some pupils don't realise what they are doing is wrong which could explain it so if I told them who it was we could figure out if they meant it or not. What I gathered from that is that there is an amount of pupils that have a history of doing this sort of thing and that makes it okay?,Casual sexual assault has been normalised in that school and it is not okay.",

        "body": "The first sexual encounter I had with a boy ended in me being forced to do everything with them apart from sex. I had just gone to sixth form and met a group of boys I didn\u2019t really know on a night out who were from another school in my city. I started speaking to one of them, but on a night out his friend spiked my drink and kissed me, then tried to make me get a cab home with him but my friends intervened and took me home. I was asleep for like 5 days after that, I thought it was a come down from drugs (I had taken MDMA that night and it was one of the first times I\u2019d taken it). The boy kept messaging me, and being naive and young, having little experience with boys I was flattered by the attention as he was considered cool and good looking. A few weird things followed- him turning up at my friends houses when I was there uninvited (they didn\u2019t know him at all) and getting kicked out of clubs for not buying tickets or having ID (we were 16) and he\u2019d wait outside for me until 4am without my knowledge, he\u2019d been kicked out at like 10pm. We ended up becoming friends, and spending a decent amount of time together so I stopped thinking he was weird. He came to my house after a night out, after we kissed he tried to get me to do stuff with him and when I refused. he left and sent me loads of angry texts questioning if I\u2019d ever done stuff with anyone, that it was so embarrassing if I hadn\u2019t etc etc. I then went to his house and he fingered me (with my consent) and I stayed over. I was ridiculously drunk that night so I didn\u2019t remember much of it. The next time he came to my house, and engaged in an argument with my older sister about how young girls posting nudes on insta should be okay. I was in a bad mood, ended up going to bed at like 5am. The next part is hard to talk about so I don\u2019t want to go into much detail but he tried to do stuff with me and when I refused, took my underwear off, picked me up and placed me on his head holding my legs down and trying to make me do 69. I refused and managed to get off, then he did a count down moving his head under the covers while I said no repeatedly and sexually assaulted me again. He then asked me to give him a blowjob, I begged not to and he said I had to do something back, I did it for about 5 seconds and then said I had cramp and turned away. He then said I wasn\u2019t ready for sex yet and that I was too tight but we would do it soon. That same night he told me he had spiked me on the night out when we first kissed as a \u2018joke\u2019 then denied it and said it was another girl who he knew did it and not him. I just went to sleep, the next day was really awkward and my mum drove him home not having a clue what happened. I then found out from the first time I stayed at his and he fingered me that he had videoed himself engaging in a sex act with me and sent it to all his friends. (I didn\u2019t know this video even existed). My sisters friend told me because her boyfriend at the time was friends with him. He and another boy made him delete the video but tbh I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still out there or what. Things then ended with him and I quickly moved on and got a boyfriend. Once we broke up the boy who sexually assaulted me started harassing me, trying to meet up and sending me explicit videos and stalking me on nights out, following me and a friend down roads etc. When I finally told people what happened he started calling me a liar, accusing me of attention seeking and his friends were horrible to me too. Since going to uni everyone was still friends with him, one of my best boy friends and my new boyfriends best friend was best friends with him. In my boyfriends uni house I had to deal with pictures being displayed of him because others in the house were friends with him. Baring in mind at this point I\u2019d moved from Manchester to london and I still had to deal with seeing him everywhere. My boyfriend was friendly with him until recently which I found really hard too. Everyone would talk to him and invite him everywhere, while knowing we were in a constant argument over what had happened. Finally now people have realised what he is like and stopped being friends with him but I told people a long time ago and it was ignored, I told a boy I was seeing at one point and he didn\u2019t care, he only cared when his new girlfriend was raped by him. I had to deal with 4 years of every night out I went on him being there, festivals, even staying over at my friends house in leeds hed be there. Everyone knew what I\u2019d said about him as well and either didn\u2019t believe me or didn\u2019t care, until it got so out of hand that he was doing it to girls on nights out and it couldn\u2019t be denied. For me it happened 5 years ago and took 4 years until people finally stopped being friends with him and some people still probably are. His friend apologised to me a year ago and told me he believed what I had said but that\u2019s the only apology or recognition I have received.",

In the end, my friends helped me get into bed, and shut the door behind me. Knowing I was there, he came in whilst I was half asleep and started having sex when I barely knew what was going on. Even though I allowed it, I felt vulnerable and uncomfortable because I was confused. Right after it, he left and went home. I still think about this every day and what I could have done to stop it. Another time, I was walking home with my dog from the park. These guys on bikes were in my path so I had to walk round them. As I moved around them I got to the end of the pathway and they followed me. They kept shouting things to me like \u201chey, what\u2019s your name?\u201d And he came right in my face and was insisting on my name. However, I carried on walking and ignored him, but he kept persisting and following me. He got in my face and was saying \u201care you just gonna blank me, yeah? You\u2019re horrible you aren\u2019t ye\u201d. He was with all his mates, I was terrified on my own, they were all laughing whilst he was in my face. I was at a family party and some guy was there, on my way home he seen me walking woth no shoes on because my heels were hurting that bad. He said he will give me a lift home and so I believed him. He got to my house and instead of slowing down, he sped up and said \u201cyou are coming to mine\u201d. I said \u201cno I don\u2019t want to can you let me out?\u201d However he locked the doors and carried on driving to his house. I kept saying take me home., then he starting trying to comfort me by saying if I just go to his for 10 minutes he will drop me off home soon. Of course, I believed him when he said this and he said we would just sit downstairs. He took me to his room and kept trying to touch me. I felt pressured into kissing him but did no more. I kept asking can you take me home and he said no, get a taxi. So I did. Then, the next day he told all his friends that he \u201cfucked me all night\u201d.

They were also part of the Christian youth group I attended sometimes. Me, my brother, his little brother and him were in my house, having a good time together. He was 17. Everything was fine until we had a lot to drink. My brother and his brother left the room, and we were beside eachother sort of cuddled up. I used to get very cuddly with my friends when I was drunk but I have since learned from this. He started groping my boobs and asked if he could do so, even though he\u2019d already started. Uncomfortable with the situation, I hesitated but drunkenly said yes. I didn\u2019t like it. He started putting his hand down my pyjama bottoms and groping my bum. This was even more uncomfortable. Thankfully I saw my brother coming in so I told him to stop and also reminded him that he had a girlfriend so I thought that this would get him to stop being weird with me. Many drinks later, we decided to go to sleep in my living room. I was on the sofa, the three boys were on the floor on mattresses. We were all very drunk, so I decided to attempt to go to sleep. The others stayed up, but then went to go to sleep shortly after. But he didn\u2019t. I felt a hand creep up my blanket and up my leg. It honestly didn\u2019t feel real. \u201cMaybe if I pretend to be asleep he\u2019ll stop?\u201d I thought to myself. It didn\u2019t. I just kept hoping that it would stop at that. I was wrong. He took my trousers down and I stiffened my legs as an attempt for him to not get them off. It didn\u2019t work. He penetrated me with his fingers and it hurt. A lot. I desperately sort of hoped \u2018maybe if I just lie here I\u2019ll maybe like it?\u2019. Funnily enough I never did like it. I froze in the moment because I was so drunk and it didn\u2019t feel real. He then began to perform oral sex on me and it was then I finally plucked up the courage to ask him what the fuck he was doing. He urged me to just go to sleep and \u2018we\u2019d talk about it in the morning\u2019. I just stared at him in shock. He then told me to go into the kitchen and we\u2019d talk about it there. He began to panic and say \u2018he thought I wanted it\u2019. then my brother entered the room and asked what was going on, and I explained. My assaulter broke into tears. So did I. I don\u2019t know if he did that because he genuinely was sorry or if he was doing it as a pity act and so I would feel as though it was my fault and not his. I wanted to share my story as I have been struggling since this incident and still sometimes feel like it was my fault. I felt as though if I hadn\u2019t of acted in certain ways, said certain things, If I hadn\u2019t let him grope my boobs earlier that night it wouldn\u2019t have happened. But I want to tell you, anyone who is reading this, not saying no doesn\u2019t equal consent. Freezing doesn\u2019t equal consent. The way you acted previously, what you were wearing etc does not equal consent. If you agreed to anything else prior such as a small cuddle or touching it DOES NOT mean you wanted or agreed to anything further than that. The only way you consent to a sexual act is by saying \u201cyes, I am comfortable with this.\u201d Or \u201cYes, you can do this.\u201d I did not say any of these things with what happened when I was trying to sleep on the sofa, and I am still coming to terms with this situation and reminding myself that it was not my fault.

I still have problems in relationships now, it is hard for me to feel ok when I\u2019m a sexual situation, my anxiety goes through the roof and I end up embarrassing myself. It is still hard to come to grips with the fact I was sexually abused and assaulted. My friends would tell me that I\u2019m lucky to have such an eager girlfriend, but it never felt right. It still doesn\u2019t. She would bite my fingers even when I would recoil in pain, bite marks would be left on them for days/weeks, drawing blood on occasion. No matter how much I would express my discomfort and pain. She would punch me and leave bruises simply because I was \u201cstrong\u201d and could \u201ctake it\u201d.

I considered the male to be trustworthy and we were very close friends. I introduced him to a huge group of my friends outside of school (most of which are a year younger than us). We had just finished year 12 and most of them had just finished Y11. We hung out in a big group a lot over summer and one time my male friend from sixth form invited a bunch of us to his for a party. We all went and on that night is when he assaulted/harassed me and a friend of mine. The girl in question was the year below and being the oldest female in the group, I felt incredibly responsible for what happened, seeing as I was the one who introduced my friends to him in the first place. He groped her ass and forced her face into his to kiss her. I wasn't aware of this until a few days later. The same night, when I was leaving I had said bye to everyone already and went into the bedroom alone to collect my bag (that's where everyone had put their stuff). He followed me in and gave me a hug which I reciprocated but then things turned nasty. He was very drunk (on several shots of vodka) and wouldn't let go. I tried to tell him that I needed to leave but he wouldn't let go of me and I tried to push him away but he gripped onto me harder and grappled my top with one of his hands. I tried to push him away with no luck and instead he pulled me onto the bed on top of him. I tried so so hard to push myself off and just couldn't do it. He was gripping me like it was fucking life or death. His hands started feeling up my top and at this point I panicked and managed to get up off the bed but not without him still attached to me. He then tried to grab my face and kiss me but I turned it away so instead he kept kissing me on the cheek. This went on for a while before he finally let go and I ran out of the room. On a separate night, another one of my female friends was also preyed on by him. She was very drunk and high that night and didn't even know what was going on. We had laid her on the sofa and gotten her water and were keeping an eye on her when he swooped in and decided to look after her. (This was before the party at his). To make a long story short, while she was completely out of it, he began making out with her forcefully and because she was in a state, she couldn't push him away or stop it. This happened months ago but I feel so wholly responsible and angry at myself that I trusted him and introduced him to friends of mine who are younger.",

He was 18, and in the sixth form attached to my secondary school. We started speaking on social media; I didn't intend for anything to happen. I was 15, and I was just having a generic chat with someone from school. During this time, I was at the peak of my mental illness (undiagnosed back then, out of a personal fear of seeing a doctor and confidentiality being broken - so my family finding out). Because he was older, and seemed less likely to panic and tell other people than those my age - I opened up to him about my struggles with mental health. It felt like nobody my age understood anyway. Mental illness wasn't really talked about then, and i didn't know anyone personally who had similar experiences at that age. He was reassuring at first. This was a relief because I had never told anyone, and he was actually being ok to me about it. He didn't think I was a freak, like I'd thought he might. As I opened up to him, he manipulated me. He was telling me how beautiful I was, and how sexy I was. I had only just told him how suicidal I was feeling, so I wasn't thinking clearly. It was nice to hear validation then, but I was mid-panic attack and didn't really consider the extent of the issue. I told him I thought I had an eating disorder. I had severe body confidence issues and I'd been starving myself. He manipulated me into sending explicit photos of myself to him. I didn't want to. I told him how uncomfortable I was with my body, how much I hated it. It was clear I didn't want to send the photos. He kept persisting, and I was so overwhelmed, I did it anyway. I cried and cried. I was scared of him. He was very tall and I saw him a lot at school - what could I have done? I was very embarrassed. One day, we were in the same block (the same department we had extra-curricular activities in). He got me to meet him in a small room so we could be alone. He touched me inappropriately. I froze. I just wanted to talk to him about what happened. I wanted to tell him we couldn't be together or do anything. He had sent me lots of graphic messages, and nudes before. He told me what he wanted very clearly. I felt so stupid for even going into that room, but I didn't consent to him touching me. Even if I had, it wouldn't have mattered - because I was underage and he was an adult. He knew he could take advantage of my mental state and my severe anxiety. If I said anything, he had my secrets and my photos. I felt like I couldn't do anything or he would expose me. I now have several diagnosed mental illnesses and I wish my first ever intimate experience wasn't taken from me like that.",

He only stopped when another teacher knocked on the class room door and I left as quickly as possible. Wasn\u2019t school supposed to be a safe place?",

The invalidation had almost erased this memory from my consciousness.,Trauma amnesia brought this memory back to me 3 years later at 19 setting off a whole range of issues like depression, anxiety and addiction which I have thankfully overcome.,Then comes 2nd Year, 1st Term at Uni and on my first day back I got drunk with my housemate. We decided to go by some more drinks and on our way asked to borrow a lighter from a guy walking past. He took us to his house just next to him where he let us into a party. We took Mandy from his mum who confusingly was at the party too. My friend was no where near as drunk as me and I\u2019d left her to go upstairs and get with this guy.,After questioning him the next day on what happened that night he was adamant we never had sex yet couldn\u2019t explain how my clothes came off and why i\u2019d found cum was inside of me.

Whispers of sexual assault happening at parties and catcalling from members of the public while we walked to and from school also happened and nothing was ever done - no assembly, no talk, no action.

I changed schools in Y9, in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I had been at an all girls' school, where (looking back) some of my peers were interested in boys, but boys still weren't talked about much. At the new school, a mixed one, I remember boys being the subject of girls' conversation most of the time, and probably vice versa. Girls and boys regarded an attraction as a relationship if dating had lasted 3 weeks. A couple who had been dating for a year were seen almost as freaks. I wasn't interested in boys yet, certainly not sexually. And I was bullied, and treated as a freak, for that, by both girls and boys, for three years, until I left at the end of Y11. I remember some of the girls deciding to tell me how sex works. I think it was on the bus home. Their comments included the phrase \"pull down your pants and jump into bed\". The bullying meant that I was reluctant to even talk to boys, especially boys that I liked, for fear or being made fun of. After all, if I was bullied for my views when I wasn't even interested in a boy, what on earth could happen if I was interested? I seemed to be the only child who wasn't interested in a relationship - there simply wasn't space in the pupil community for children like me. And that feeling has persisted far into my adult life. It's only since #MeToo took off, and in some ways only in the last few months, that I've begun to realise that it was ok that I wasn't interested in boys sexually, that there were probably many girls at that school who felt the same and who couldn't speak out because of the prevailing culture.,The school did nothing. I can't believe that the staff didn't know about the bullying or the reasons behind it - the culture was so clear that they must have known something. Discipline in classes was bad, so even if staff didn't hear what was said at lunch and break times, they must have heard what was said in class.",

Until he took me to his car where I blacked out to the memory of him forcing himself inside me. I woke up unconscious in a corridor of the party having lost my shoes, my pants and my bra, having a hazy recollection of what had happened. When I went into school the next day I was labelled a slut for having had sex so young and so publicly, while a photo of my lost bra and shoes circulated around school. Surely people would have realised that if I was so drunk to have lost my shoes and underwear, I couldn\u2019t have had the capacity to give consent? The lack of awareness of consent at the time (and failure to provide sex ed at my school) meant that I didn\u2019t realise I had been raped until years later - I thought the fact I hadn\u2019t screamed, I hadn\u2019t run away, that I was so drunk that I let myself get in that situation, that the lines were blurred, meant it was my fault. I hadn\u2019t realised why I\u2019d cried every time I saw myself naked for six months after, why this fear of my body eventually manifested itself through an eating disorder which I presume was an attempt to get control back over it when I felt like it wasn\u2019t mine anymore.

No. No. No. No. No. Over and over. I couldn\u2019t have been any more explicit. No. When I realised he wasn\u2019t listening I felt a sort of disassociation. I felt like I was watching myself from above and I could see what was happening but I couldn\u2019t stop it. I can vividly remember lying and just resigning myself to my fate. This was happening. He started by kissing my neck, cheek, ears then lips. I said no. He then went on to rolling me over to him and making me touch him, forcefully moving my hands to his crotch when I was trying to move it away.

No one else was in there. He came and sat next to me, asking if I was alright, asking if I could dance with him, I told him to just give me a minute to myself and I\u2019d be back in the garden. He got closer, started running his hand up and down my leg, I asked him to get off of me and that it made me uncomfortable, he then started putting his hand up my dress, saying \u201cwhy? Do you not like this then?\u201d I tried to get up off the sofa, he pulled me down, I was 9st7 and he was about 16st. He pulled me into the sofa, I shouted get off and he grabbed my face with one hand, my waist with another. He was kissing me, despite me crying and squirming he wouldn\u2019t stopped kissing me, moving his hands up and down my body. He only stopped because a good friend of mine came in to see if I was ok. Afterwards, he told me I should be grateful because my \u2018lumpy body\u2019 and \u2018fat legs\u2019 were disgusting for him to grab. I was a size 8. It made me develop an eating disorder, I was scared of my own male friends, this was 4 years ago, and it still haunts me. 4 years ago, a size 4, and a mere 113lbs later, I still have nightmares.

These photos or videos would be sent (I'm ignorant to the contexts, consent or wilfulness of the original exchange) personally and then rapidly circulate to schools around [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. This also took place with one male in our school, who was himself, known to solicit intoxicated and previously not known girls for photographs and harass them frequently.

A boy in our year got expelled for up-skirting a teacher (who also left the school shortly afterwards) and sharing the photo. The discourse (myself included) was less focused on condemnation for the sex crime that had occurred and more of the (what we saw as humorous) outlandishness of the attempt to do such a thing or the so-called unknown 'grass' or guy who 'baited' him (discussed perplexity on why he would do that etc).\",\u201cIt genuinely makes me feel violently ill how I used to spend time with those boys.

I as a 13-14 year old young girl didn\u2019t deserve the sheer amount of bullying and sexual abuse from boys in my year circulating sexual videos of me without my consent and slut shaming me for being raped (the same boys were trying to sleep with me) I am angry about the fact that the staff at the time and the school as a whole didn\u2019t deal with the situation as they should\u2019ve of done. I was vulnerable and I even remember at one time an English teacher blamed me for other peoples actions. I had older years physically assaulting me in the school premises when school should have been a safe environment for me to feel comfortable in. The school failed me and I am still currently in therapy right now. I sent them a petition so other young girls/ boys don\u2019t go through the same things as I did. I know they can\u2019t do anything for me now but I hope they change the way they educate children on consent/ sexual harassment, so what I went through doesn\u2019t happen to other young people.",

He would wrap his leg around mine, run it up and down, put his hands up my skirt, up my thighs, tried touching my area. I told him to stop so many times and he kept going. One day I didn\u2019t wear a jumper and he grabbed my bra strap at the back and started asking my size, and I told him to stop. He didn\u2019t like that. He got worse, touching me more in my private area, on my stomach, tried getting up my shirt.

He kept asking and asking to have sex and my answer remained the same. I said I was tied and was going straight to sleep so I could just wake up and leave to get the fist train home at like 5 am. He then said \"its fine you can just sleep and ill fuck you\", this was so disturbing I knew I wouldn't be able to properly sleep incase I woke up and he was having sex with me.

I instantly froze and just lay there with my eyes closed waiting for it to be over, after about 10 mins he stopped as he could see I was unresponsive and silent.

After we couldn\u2019t have sex he said \u201call I wanted to do this summer was lose my virginity\u201d and it was clear that was all I was there for. We tried to have sex again and it just hurt even more. He never once asked if I was okay with any of this or asked specifically for consent and I could see how annoyed he was that I couldn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d him lose his virginity.

"I was dating a lad I met of a friend (never met him) and at the start he was very nice and loving. Always caree about what I had to say and my opinions. Then around 2-3 weeks into the relationship he started to act weird. Causing aurgements over having boy mates, saying hi to a boy. Literally the smallest things ever. He started sending me pictures of knives and threatening me with them. Then one day we had a really bad aurgement over a boy making me uncomfortable. He started getting really mad calling me names, showing my knives, telling me to shut up or fuck off. I left him alone for abit to cool off, then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I got a text from him saying ""im so sorry about what happened babe. To make it up to you. Ill come meet you."" I was suspicious but forgot about it soon. I met him at a local shop near my house. I saw him, I ran up to him and went to hug him. Then I realised he had a knife in his hand. He pressed it up against my back and said ""better fucking behave"" I immediately froze. I was terrified. We got on a bus back to his house it was a large house but not very large. His room was painted a beige colour and he had a desk next to his bed and a window. He pushed me up against thr bed. Pinned my hands above my head against the wall. N started taking our clothes off. I started kicking. Really hard. And he got more and more pissed and proceeded to molest me. I can remember a pain in my stomach and back. And can remember blood everywhere. I cried. And cried. And cried. He held me and fell asleep when he was done. I manged to get off him without waking him up and jumping out the window. I still had like 20 quid on me so I ran to the bus stop n caught a bus back home.",APRIL 24 2023,TUNISIA

"I was six years old when I was first subjected to a form of assault by a family member. That person and I were playing a game. But then I accidentally fell so then they took that chance, pressed up against me, then proceeded to kiss me and touch me inappropriately. After that incident, they never touched me again. I thought this thing was normal and I basically almost did the same thing to my childhood best friend, but luckily they were smarter than me and said no.Then another few incidents happened when i was seven.

Every time i met up or got babysat by said person I would get locked up in a room, they would make me straddle them and touch them.

"I was raped continuously throughout my 5 years at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] first school in [location omitted to preserve anonymity]. There was only one male teacher present at the school at the time and he seemed very nice and friendly, clearly not. He was a pedophile who unfortunately never got caught for his actions and moved away when he ran out of people to abuse. Noone at the school believed me when I told them about what he was doing because I was so young ( aged 5 - 9 years old ) and told me that I was just being silly and that he was ""helping"" as he was one of the only people at the school trained in first aid and he didn't teach any subjects, so he took the opportunity to whenever a child came in, rape them and say that it was helping. [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] was such an amazing school when I went but eversince it has become a horrible school.

Everyone does it and so on but I just kept replying saying I don’t want to just yet we haven’t been together long and I’m still really young and he used to get so ma diver it I just have in but then over time it just happens every single day and it was so draining he wouldn’t let me go out I had to be with him 2[date omitted to preserve anonymity]/7 and all he wanted was sex all the time and it got to paint where I told him I don’t want to anymore and one day he got so mad at it to the point where he grabbed me and choked me shouting your going to do what I say end of and he raped me.

"When I was a first year at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity], I lived in the infamous [location omitted to preserve anonymity] and honestly I loved it. I was always a party girl and this new found freedom was magical to me. I had just got out of a relationship and I was on tinder a lot and I met up with a guy in my student accommodation let’s call him D, we had consensual sex a good few times at halloween time and after that we didn’t speak and honestly I had moved on with my life. After a while I noticed a lot of red flags in him and I just generally lost interest. When I got back from the christmas holidays I started buying weed from him and therefore out of necessity we’d talk occasionally (nothing flirty or even that friendly just civil). In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he invited himself to an afters at my house at which I was very drunk, once the majority of people had gone home he was begging me to stay at mine “because his friends was sleeping in his bed” after saying no multiple times I eventually gave in under the understanding I just wanted to go to sleep. However once he got into my bed he wouldn’t leave me alone, grinding up against me and kissing my neck despite my protests. He then said he wouldn’t let me sleep till I’d had sex with him. This guy was a 6ft very big guy, and I mean weightlifter kinda build, I am fairly tall (5ft 8 ish) but at the time was only 62kg so I knew I couldn’t do anything to stop him. I kept saying no but he wouldn’t take it for an answer, he had raped me in my own bed and I question whether it was rape because I let it happen I guess but it was easier than fighting with him. I begged him to use a condom and not to cum in me but he listened to neither, I am greatful I never got pregnant/ an STD. But I cried for the entire day after and for months I felt so uncomfortable during sex. My body felt dirty and I have never felt so much like a slut, idk the fun stopped when I realised I didn’t even really have control over my own body anymore, I can’t even describe how worthless that made me feel. I think universities should make more of an effort to protect young students in halls because I know so many people who have been raped in those halls, it is up to [location omitted to preserve anonymity] uni to step up.",APRIL 22 2023,SCOTLAND

I walked into my classroom a mess and asked if I could talk to my teacher I had told her I needed to see the head and she agreed, police came to my house and questioned me and they gathered the cctv and my statement and he was expelled from the school only to come in for his GCSEs.

"My last relationship was physically abusive. I’m quite mentally ill and they used this against me a lot. A lot of the time it would be ‘i’ll be quick’ or ‘you owe me it’ or ‘come on i know you want to’ kind of thing throughout. Then it came to it where they were telling me that if i don’t have sex with them they’ll tell authorities everything that i’ve done, probably resulting in me being in a hospital, so i was terrified of them and they raped me and i still get flashbacks when im not distracted. it just kind of creeps up on me. they made me lose all my friends and family and when i asked to leave the relationship they started a physical fight with me.

"I was raped a while ago by a man a few years older than me, he held me captive in my university accommodation and forced me to perform degrading acts on him. All the while he was extremely aggressive and continually choked me, telling me that I better be a ""good girl"" for him or he'll hurt me badly. One key phrase also stuck in my mind, as he remarked that ""it's so cute how weak you are"" when he was raping me. I feel so ashamed having done what he said, and since then there have been multiple incidents of sexual assault from other men in moments when I least expect it. I can't seem to recover or trust men because every time I begin to feel confident in myself and my sexuality, someone takes away my autonomy in a brief moment with a gesture or action and I'm back to feeling helpless and ashamed.

"When I was in kindergarten there was a group of 3 children (boys) who liked to go around and put their hands under girls skirts and tickle you there. We were allaround 3 to 4 years old. I remember that I used to go to class in summer just wearing the apron of the uniform, which was basically as a dress, as it was too hot. Since this started happening I didn't want to do it anymore and didn't want to put skirts neither. I also remember that one day I entered the little wooden house we had in the garden and I saw the same 3 children and another girl of my age.

"I was about 7 when I was first sexually abused. My parents had separated and I was with my dad at the weekend. He had a job to do at his cousin's house, and I was left to play with her secondary-school age son. At some point he convinced me to climb under his bed and help him with his homework. He then put a thermometer inside my vagina. I don't recall much about it, but know that he told me it should be a secret. The second instance was during my early teens, my second year of secondary school. I used to get off the bus at my grans house and stay with her until my mum got home. I would usually either go and sit in the kitchen or front room and watch telly. I don't remember the details of how it came about but I think it started that I'd always go and give my grandad a kiss on the cheek as a greeting when I came in, and he must have turned his face towards me one day. Eventually, it became that I would sit next to him on the sofa and he would kiss me inappropriately for minutes at a time. I don't remember when or why it stopped, but I just remember being glad it had. I felt so confused, was he cheating on my gran? I was only 12. I let both of these memories pass in to the distant memories of my early life as I had clearly decided to not report the behaviours so couldn't see any point in hashing it up in my mind. I didn't realise that I should have sought help for the mental repercussions, as I feel these two instances are the reason that I spent my teenage years putting myself in increasingly dangerous situations and having sex with strangers, being taken advantage of and being abused by men who took my lack of no to be a yes. I am now a stable, settled 30 year old and am married with two children and my husband is the kindest, most respectful and caring man you could meet. I am one of the lucky ones.

I would always arrive home with bruises on my arms my parents would ask me why i had bruises but I always lied to them by telling them I 'fell off' the swings. the touching got so bad over the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he would sometimes finger me and tell me I felt 'nice' I would go home crying because I felt stupid for letting him do that, one day I went to school in a skirt and I sat next to him in class for our last lesson I had one of my girl classmates sit next to me so I could feel comfortable at that time she didn't know why I felt comfortable around her, it was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] before lesson ended the classmate next to me dropped her ruler so the guy obviously took advantage and went to 'pick' it up I was sitting there right in front of the ruler and he grabbed it and pushed the ruler right in between my legs I jolted out of my chair and told him I had enough he was begging me not to tell the teacher but I felt like I needed to do something so I went to the teacher and told her. She was furious with what I told her she immediately went up to him and pulled him out of class (she pulled me out of class as well) she asked me how long this was going on for and I told her 3 years she didn't hear his side of the story because she saw how I acted around him when he was near me. after minutes of waiting my mum got called and so did his the police got involved as well, in the end he got removed from school for 1 month and I got therapy for the rest of my school year. the feeling of him touching me is still engraved in my head and I cant get rid of it.",APRIL 19 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

The first few times we had sex was entirely on my terms, he had done it before and so was okay with it. About two months into the relationship he started wanting to have sex a lot more. Every time I saw him the first thing he would try and do was have sex. Even if I was on my period or not in the mood. It got to the point where I never wanted to have sex, but he would always talk me into it. He would spend ages - up to 40 minutes one time - trying to get me to say yes. I always would, but that was because I was scared about how he would react if I carried on saying no. For four months of our relationship we only had fully consensual sex once. I started to think that was all he wanted from me, he wouldn't talk to me much during the day and then we were both back from school the conversations would always turn sexual, constantly asking for nudes and especially at night. He once held me by my neck during sex after I had continuously said I didn't want him to. I broke up with after six months. Right now, I am conflicted. I cant tell if what I experienced was sexual assault or not, because I would always say yes in the, even if I didn't want to and always after he would spend ages pressuring me into it.",APRIL 19 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

"The girls within my unit have constantly been harassed both sexually and otherwise by both male cadets and male members of staff throughout my time in the unit. From sexual conquest lists to being treated like objects of sexual desires we have faced many obstacles throughout. When reported to the staff the biggest consequence given was a verbal warning. Even though we all sat through a briefing at the start of the university year about how sexual harassment was not tolerated in the navy and that it would be instant dismissal. The staff wonder why we don't take welfare issues to them, but how can we if we don't feel like our voices can be heard. One incidence [date omitted to preserve anonymity] a major perpetrator of the sexual harassment was promoted into a position of leadership. One of the very people we are meant to go to when we have an issue. The staff even found what he did funny, Our commanding officer even referring to his sexual conquest list as his ""ultimate orgy list"". A member of staff once made me feel as though I hadn't earned my place in my unit fairly and suggested that my bruises were not from an obstacle course that I had just done but because I had a boyfriend. Repeatedly making comments similar to this even once I had made it clear that it was making me uncomfortable. I have faced multiple sexual harassment comments made by people who have previously been on verbal warnings. Proving that the welfare system doesn't work but when asked if we could change the system the staff close themselves off to protect themselves. The whole issue is perpetuated by the boys club in the leadership team. They just want to protect themselves. When it came out that a large percentage of the girls in the unit were unhappy and had complained we all received messages from the boys about how they felt they had done nothing wrong and why hadn't we told them before. When we had all tried on so many occasions. The fact that the person in charge of welfare [date omitted to preserve anonymity] was part of the 'boys club' only made the issue worse. The issue led to the involvement of one of the most senior officers involved in the organisation where their suggestion was to only give verbal warnings. Even though this contradicts all of the policies that the navy has. No action has been taken against the staff member that complaints were made against, not even a recognition of an email that was sent to the commanding officer where the staff member was named. It has all been hidden away in an attempt to protect careers above the welfare of the female cadets.",APRIL 18 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

"I was emotionally, financially and physically vulnerable at the time - at 15 my father had been jailed, our house, money and belongings repossessed and trying to carry on with education and life while hiding this situation from the small middle class white community we lived in and already felt alienated from. My mother who had not worked for +20yrs was also found guilty in the court case, while doing her court ordered community service hours she struggled to get a paid job to help provide for the household, claiming benefits and always counting her pennies; we were all trying our best to make ends meet and build a stable life again. At the time, I aspired to be a doctor just like some of the richest and smartest family members I had, and so pursued as much work experience and volunteering as I could. I joined a local disabled charity, one that ran weekly activities and summer camps for disabled children. All the volunteers were around my age and up to mid 20s, with the managers being from mid 20s to 40s. I was successful in the interview process and was onboarded into an establishment I could not have imagined existed given it is a charity with a mission to provide life-long support to the local disabled community. There was a clear position of power for the managers and leaders in their mid 20s, both directly and indirectly - in working conditions they were the boss, in social positions they would openly discuss the female volunteers sexually and compare us. On numerous occasions, 3 of the leaders leveraged settings like 1:1 car shares, 1:1 tasks that were away from the group, and after-work drinks to sexually harass and eventually sexually assault me which is the story I want to share. One of the leaders had been giving me a lot of attention - one on one I would receive flattery, kind words, sometimes tasteful jokes, but in group settings would find ways to make me feel small, weak and ugly amongst the other volunteers. Without realising, I was being groomed to yearn for his validation and make him happy; this went on 5days a week for 2months. Nearing the end of the summer camp, us volunteers and leaders were helping prepare the charity building for renovation - clearing out items and putting rubbish in skips, I was 16 and couldn't drive, so as per his information, I told my mother to pick me up at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. As [date omitted to preserve anonymity] approached, the volunteers and leaders started grabbing their belongings and said their goodbyes, I called out to one of the leaders and said ""where's everyone going? [name omitted to preserve anonymity] told me we're finishing at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]"". That leader laughed and said ""no, we finish at [date omitted to preserve anonymity] but maybe he has something for you to do"", gave a smirk to two of the older boys and left with everyone. I wanted to text my mother to tell her to pick me up as soon as she can, it was only me and [name omitted to preserve anonymity] in the building, but he told me not to, gave me comforting words that he just wanted to spend some time with me without everyone getting in the way. He began touching my body. He described what he loved about my body, how he found me attractive and how much he liked me and began kissing my neck and then my lips, and pulled me into, what was, the soft play area. I said to him I felt uncomfortable, I felt weird and told him we should leave, it's weird and wrong to be doing this and asked him to stop. He used his winning tactic; he started demeaning me, compared me to the other women, and said in summary that he would humiliate me if I didn't put out. He started removing my clothes, I felt stuck. I was so groomed into doing what he wished. He removed his clothes and started touching himself, groping my body and muttering what he wanted to do to me. I was on my period and I was both scared he would see my pad and use that to humiliate me, but also hoped it would be a way to stop him. It didn't, he brought me to the floor, now on top of me, pinning me down, grinding on me and moaning, forcing his fingers inside me and then his dick and took my virginity. In a minute he finished inside me. My jeans were stained with both fresh blood and my period and I was in pain, was spacey and mute. He got dressed, and held me, comforted me. And told me to ask my mum to come pick me up. We waited in silence while he scrolled his phone walking in and out of the room. When my mum arrived I went out to her car and he went to his and we went our separate ways. I never shared this with my family. This was the beginning of a coercive relationship that spanned 2yrs. He would take pictures of me naked, post them on [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] and threaten to share it with others if I didn't perform sexual acts on him. I was weak and let him have access to my body when he wanted and how he wanted. When I confided in a fellow female volunteer, the conversation was dismissed, she told me she was already aware that I was sleeping with [name omitted to preserve anonymity], ""everyone has had their time with [name omitted to preserve anonymity]"", he'd already been sleeping with her friends and even herself. She would flirt with him at work drinks, and resent when the boys would discuss the acts he would do to me. It was entertainment, and it became a competition of which girl is best in the sack. A new female volunteer joined, 16yo at the time, and she was the new girl he pursued, he would send me naked photos of her and ask me why I didn't have an amazing body like hers, he would describe how much better she was in bed, he shared his [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] account that had hundreds of faceless nudes of other women he had fucked including her and me. And that day was when I realised I was part of his sick game. Even to this day I blame myself for being a part of this, for allowing him access to my body, and it's taken 10yrs and discussions in therapy to understand that what I experienced was sexual coercion, and I was targeted for my vulnerability. The charity community was in fact culpable, as I heard in our community socials, managers in their 40s would find entertainment in discussing the sexual acts these boys were doing to female volunteers. Even the father of one of the boys who was chairman of the charity would find these stories entertaining and high five the boys. Blurred lines and my not-so-aggressive approach to saying ""no"" was what made me feel like I am the one to blame. It destroyed my sense of self-worth, regularly considering suicide between 17 and 18yrs old, and even attempting at a nearby railway line near my house. I am grateful I have grown a thicker skin, I am grateful I have confidence to leave situations I don't feel comfortable and call out sexually coercive behaviour - but learning the hard way affected my youth and the healing process was painful. I was hiding a dark and painful life for years, I certainly didn't need it while my family and I were, and still are, rebuilding our lives after my fathers conviction and the subsequent repossession, and it didn't serve any good to my education.",APRIL 18 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"I am in my 30s now but I have come to realise that I was sexually exploited as a teenager by my peers. I had never got into any trouble or had any real issues until I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Around this age I started to self sabotage - drinking, smoking, skipping school, just not really caring about things. I can see now in hindsight that this was linked to unresolved issues around loss and death, but at the age of [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I didn't know why I was doing what I was doing and I just felt angry at the world. This time coincided with becoming romantically/sexually involved with boys from school but as the drinking increased, my power and control over my decisions diminished. I ended up with a reputation as a girl who would do sexual acts and boys would capitalise on that - waiting for me to be drunk and then getting me to do things when I could barely stand. As a young person I thought I had control and choice over this, and in some instances I still think I did but there was a whole bunch of situations where I can now see I was sexually assaulted. There were some times that I don't remember, or that I do remember parts of, and distinctly remember not wanting to do things and saying no, but they still happened. It was only recently that I saw one man who I went to school with, who I have not seen since leaving school, that it really hit me. I felt physically sick seeing him. I was dragged straight back to being 15 in a woodland to an experience I had not thought of in 20 years. It was then I started to think about other situations and other boys. I wonder if the boys think about it in the same way, or whether they still think of me as a drunk girl, a sure thing, as someone who is consenting through their actions of being too drunk to say no, consenting through their reputation. I started to think about the fact that the staff at the school must have known what was going on - I know they did as one particularly awful teacher commented on me being 'promiscuous' in a class once. I have gone on to have a very sucessful career where I support people, some of whom have experienced sexual abuse. Yet the realisation that I too was a victim or survivor (depending on what language you use) never hit me until very recently and I think it is now something I need to work through for myself.

"I was living with my boyfriend, who I felt like didn't find me attractive anymore, and wasn't putting a lot of effort into our relationship.

"This is a long read so if you do choose to read it, thank you. I don’t know if this story counts because I wasn’t physically assaulted but I’ve always been cautious around a certain family member of mine and have recently been told some horrific things about them. When I was about 14 I had an ‘outing’ with said family member that lasted a whole day and we were alone all day. It was about thirty degrees so I was in shorts and a vest top. Not long into the day he started asking me inappropriate questions like ‘have you had sex?’ Then when I said no he listed sexual acts and asked me if i had done any of them. I replied with no to every question of course. He then proceeded to ask me about what sexual things friends my age have done and asking me to go into detail. I replied with ‘I don’t know’ and made it clear i was uncomfortable with the situation but this didn’t stop him. Im putting this on here to raise awareness because this was supposed to be someone I feel safe with. A blood relative who watched me grow for 14 years. A person I used to cuddle and tell them I loved them. That day has been haunting me ever since and I can’t help thinking that if my answer wasn’t no when they asked if I had sex then maybe they would had assaulted me. I told my mum [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because we were going to be seeing this particular person soon. I begged her not to tell my dad in fear of what he would do to them. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I told my dad. It come out to the whole family in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and they have not attended any family events since and have been cut off by some family because of it. Although I wasn’t physically assaulted (by this person anyway) it haunts me more than the times I have been. Every time I think about it I feel sick. No one talks about it. No one has addressed it to me at all since it came out, not him or his wife or any of his kids. It’s just life as normal like it never happened. But it did happen and it has traumatised me.",APRIL 16 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

"The first time I was assaulted was backstage in a theatre by a co-actor during a theatre camp the summer I turned 15. He was 21. Because of him, I formed an eating disorder right as I was hitting puberty. I would refuse to eat until I couldn't recognize myself until I was no longer the girl he saw and liked so much. I have always wanted to be an actor, and the fact that it was backstage at a theatre was devastating for me. I remember I was learning to drive and once I started driving alone, I would have panic attacks while driving on the freeway because I would see his face in the backseat. I would have to pull over and convince myself he wasn't actually there. It took me most of high school to work through that experience. I finally was getting much better and truly not thinking about him and I felt confident in myself at college, I overcame my eating disorder and I was comfortable in myself. Then, in [date omitted to preserve anonymity], the beginning of my sophomore year of college, I went out to a bar with some of my friends, I wasn't that drunk and my roommate started dancing with this guy. I'm gay and only like women but sometimes it's fun to just fuck around at bars, especially bars that mostly just have straight men and women. So I started dancing with the guy's friend. My roommate and I were dancing next to each other with these guys. And the guy I was dancing with somehow pulled us away from my friends and my roommate and raped me in the corner of the bar. It was so crowded no one could see us, my friends had no clue where I went and I didn't know where they were. I'm not sure how long it lasted, but I was just trying to lock eyes with someone I knew. Finally, one of my friends saw me and pulled me further into the dance floor. I didn't report it because I didn't even know the guy's name, I would not be able to identify him if he was right in front of me. That experience set me into the deepest depression I have ever been in in my life. I was showing signs of alcoholism because of it, coming home every night from classes and drinking half a bottle or a full bottle of wine by myself. I was actively suicidal and almost attempted on two different occasions. But now, [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I finally feel like I am in a good place, I still can't go to that bar but I feel confident in myself, and my sexuality, and I don't feel like it was my fault anymore. And it is still hard because I feel like these things will never go away. And sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I had tried to report it. But I am so proud of myself for how far I've come and I am so proud of the person I've become and how I was able to pick myself back up and try to love living again.",APRIL 14 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

One of my friends noticed something was up but I didn't say anything. I had dance that night. I went to change in the bathrooms and started to cry. I made sure to not be loud as my dance teacher would easily be able to hear. The first person I told was my best friend the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] on the bus, I just started crying.

"During my maths classes I sat next to a boy who I liked, and I was pretty sure he liked me. But then he started touching my leg and I’d move away, but every lesson it would get worse and he’d have his whole hand up my skirt, I would push him away, ask him to stop and try and move but it didn’t stop him. I requested to move seat and was told no, and one day for dress as you please he came up behind me and grabbed my ass and slapped it, even after I messaged him and asked him to stop he never did.

"This is going to be long, but thank you for reading. I don't even remember how old I was when it started. I think under 9. I don't know if that is a trauma response or if I didn't even consider what happened to be an event worth noting at the time. I loved to play fight, just like I would my cousin. Me and my other cousin, his sister, who is a year younger than me would constantly bombard him on the couch, trying to get him to play with us. He would, but different than the way that I would with my own brothers. Me and my girl cousin would sit on his legs, our signal that we had won the fight. Then, he would tell me to ""sit on his face"". I didn't know what he was saying, what it meant or implied, I just thought it was how I would officially win our so-called battles. I don't know if I will ever forgive myself for following his orders. Sometimes, he would place his hands on his face when I sat, and squeeze my butt. I would say ""ew, you're touching my butt"". ""Eww"" he would repeat, while further digging his boney fingers into my ass. I don't know how many times this happened. A lot. I knew it felt wrong but I didn't know why. I also didn't know why I couldn't sleep in my own room at night, or why I would check behind my door and under any bed a total of 10 times before I could sleep. It wasn't one specific moment when I discovered I was assaulted, but as I got older I gradually realized what happened and I swore I would take it to my grave. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I told my therapist and some close friends. I was diagnosed with anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. My parents would yell at me for being rude and antisocial at family events (most of which I felt physically sick during). I want to mention that my parents are my two best friends, I told them everything other than this. I didn't want to ruin my moms relationship with her sister (his mom). I felt I would be responsible for our families demise. I was scared of most men. Eventually, I told my parents, they were very understanding and do not make me see him, letting me skip out on some family events. This will forever alter my relationship with sex, and men as a whole. And I live with the knowledge that he will most likely be at my wedding, because he is family and unless I tell my other extended family who I am close to, he can't be the only one I don't invite. I live my life in fear of being raped, because I could barley survive being assaulted. The worst part is, I always feel like I am overreacting and unjustified in the trauma I feel. And this is disgusting, but sometimes I almost wish worse had happened to me so that at least the trauma I feel would match what my mind tries to tell me is worthy of that response. If that makes sense. People tell me to not let it define me, but I don't even know who I would be if it hadn't happened. Thank you for taking your time and reading this. I love you and you are worth so much. You can and will survive what has happened to you.",APRIL 05 2023,VIRGIN ISLANDS (US)

"I am now a middle aged woman. A mum with three children. One of whom is 14. One of whom is 11. Both are developing breasts and look so beautiful. I look at my children and try so hard not to see them as targets. I want to talk to them about their growing beauty and self confidence and not feel like I have to warn them not to act certain ways or dress certain ways. But I was once a young and blossoming teenager. And I was on a uni trip. In my first year at uni. We went to a famous landmark in a foreign city. My friend and I met some local boys. We went to their flat. I had sex with one of the three boys. Then they wanted me to have sex with his friends too. Which I didn’t want to. They wanted my friend to. She didn’t want to. Suddenly I felt like the situation had changed. There were three of them and two of us. We were in a strange city, no one knew where we were. It was scary. I felt like if one of us didn’t do what they wanted we were in danger. I was quite sexually active. My friend had only slept with one person ever. I felt scared. For her and me. The situation felt very threatening. We were all in the same room. I was naked. Which in itself was weird in front of my friend. The two other boys brought her in to see what was happening. I have just read about the freeze or friend response. It now explains what happened next. I let them have sex with me. I let them pull me around and use my body. They used me and I just let them. The only thing I didn’t “let them” do was put their penis in my mouth. I said I’d bite it off. But they put it in my vagina and anus. Two of them at once. I felt like a dead weight being spun. pulled and poked and just waiting for it to be over. The trip went home the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] with me included. Thank goodness. Afterwards I had cuts and bruises and scratches. And I went home from uni to my parents and they took to me to a rape centre. I didn’t have HIV or any STIs. I didn’t have counselling. My friend said she had heard me laughing - during the act. I wasn’t laughing out of pleasure I was laughing out of fear. I have spent two decades trying to understand what happened, my part in it, which bits were my fault. What I could have done differently. I am still genuinely proud of my instinct to protect my friend. Because it was a true selfless act. So I must be a good person. But what did those boys think was happening? Did they think I was having fun? I can still remember being limp. Like an unconscious person with my eyes open. Did they think they were raping me? Did they think I was having fun? “You’ve had your fun what about us?” They said at one point. Fun??? It wasn’t fun. It was terrifying. Did I say no? I don’t remember? Did they know we didn’t want to? That it wasn’t what we’d gone with them for? How many other girls did they do this to. They lived right by this monument I feel like they would have done this over and over. My liberated sexual encounter with a stranger in a foreign city had gone from lovely adventure to a confusing assault. And now so much time has passed I’ll never know. This is why I fear for my daughters. I don’t know how to warn them or protect them. How to give them confidence but not over-confidence. I dread the day when one of them comes to me having been assaulted or raped. But I feel like it’s almost inevitable. In my lifetime I’ve been raped, assaulted, groped and spoken to - in a way … like they own our bodies for their amusement. So many times. Haven’t we all.",APRIL 01 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

"I was sexually assaulted in my first term in [location omitted to preserve anonymity]. I told the uni about it and I was not heard properly. the uni completely dismissed my claim and suspended him for 3 months during the internal look about it but then he was released. after a night out i left my flatmates to go and get food with him and a few other guys before i went back home with them and was chatting to them in my flat’s communal kitchen. i then went to bed and left my room unlocked (as i would as i trusted my flat.) i then was falling asleep while half drunk when he came into my room and into my bed. he then went to my bed and tried to kiss me. i told him stop and he kept saying “i’ve always wanted to do this” and “i know you want it… tell me no if you don’t want it”. i continued to say stop and he continued to the point where he was trying to finger me. eventually i told him to fuck off, still in my drunken state, and he finally left. i then ran to my door, locked it and told the boy i had been very close with about it over phone (waking him up) as i was in his hoodie and i felt so terrible about it. he was the one who then got me to screenshot the next messages he sent me saying “that shouldn’t have happened” “i’m crying can you let me in to apologise” “we shouldn’t have been together”. that last message hit me the most. we weren’t together in the first place. the only reason he was in my flat was because he was having sex with my flatmate the door next to me. she was still awake through this. i sent her the screenshots as soon as i sent them with a message below explaining everything before i then sent it to my whole flat as they all knew him. she then let him sleep in her room [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. she has then continued to see him outside of the flat, not believing a thing i say. i can’t wait to get out of first year and not to live with her. living with a person who hangs out with him all the time kills me. living with another flatmate, a guy, who is living with him [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and again, doesn’t believe a thing i have sent and proven has also hurt me an immense amount. i am very lucky to have the friends around me that i have as my first term has been especially tough. this term has been much worse seeing him hanging out outside in places that i regularly go to has also been extremely hard but my friends have helped me through it.",APRIL 01 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"i was sexually assaulted for months at this school. The guy was supposedly gay and i didnt think anything of it. we were in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] so i knew that what he was doing was wrong i just wasnt sure what to do. i told myself that because he was gay maybe he acted wierd to other girls? Im not sure ive never had a gay friend. It started off with hugs, then turned into grabbing my boobs and slapping my butt. i was in a friendship group with all boys so they all though i was a pussy if i was to tell anyone about it. it kept getting worse and worse. He did it to plenty of other girls too, about three or four? But not to the extent of what he did to me. I felt like i didnt have a voice as i know my schools history of mental health problems and sa. He was in most of my classes and that made me feel very uncomfortable and i skipped school alot and faked being sick just because i wouldnt have to see him. I went into my photography class and he decided to join my group. it was okay for about 10 mins but then he sat under the table and was pretending to be on his phone even though it was obvious he was taking pictures up my skirt. I crossed my legs and was contemplating saying something but im too socially anxious for that, he then got up and sat extremely close to me and rested his head on my shoulder. He then proceeded to put my hand on my thigh and proceeded to go higher and higher, nobody was there to witness it and i felt like if i was to tell anyone nobody would believe me. He put his hand up my skirt and was pulling it up, thats when i decided to take photos of him doing this whilst he was on his phone. i tried to tell my friends but as i thought none of them believed me and even when i showed them the photos they thought i was just over exaggerating. I told my mum [date omitted to preserve anonymity] it happened. she immediately contacted the school and we had a meeting. i wasnt in school for weeks because i have anxiety of going to school now because of that. it took the school about 2 days to actually have a meeting with me.

His parents didnt do anything to punish him and just blamed it on him being gay. the school said that there isnt much they can do atm and i was so mad. it took them 2 weeks to get him out of all of his classes and he had another meeting about how sa is wrong? isnt that common sense! He got excluded from my school about a month or two after reporting it. not suspended for the time being so they can wait for the paperwork to go through so he can be excluded. I had to see him everyday even after everything. My school is absolutely awful at dealing with sa and mental health.

Eventually the disciplinary meeting happened after it being pushed back 2 times. They allowed his lawyer to victim blame me with no repercussions and no one stopped him at all.

If the uni have found it proven that he raped someone, they should be kicked out on the spot. There is absolutely nothing he could say to defend himself as it is inexcusable. they refused to let him hear my victim impact statement after i had requested they would multiple times. It seemed like they were trying to protect him throughout especially since he hired a lawyer. I was forced to keep the whole thing confidential the whole time and threatened that they would drop the case if i told people which meant i had to see mutual friends carry on being friends with him.

If you don’t complete it you are not meant to have access to any online [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] platforms which i believe means noodle [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] etc. Yet he didn’t complete it and had access to everything and there were no repercussions to it. He would have learnt about consent which possibly could have stopped me from being raped if the uni had just bothered to chase him up on the course as they should have given it was ‘mandatory’. We put in a formal complaint to the uni and haven’t heard anything and it has been around 3 months.",MARCH 28 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"I was 13 years old when this happened, a month into joining a new school when I was raped. I was getting changed, for my PE lesson in my study room, that I shared with another boy we'll call him x, when x booted the door open as he usually did but this time instead of sitting down on his desk, he pushed me to the floor. Lying on my chest unable to move he pulled off my underwear as he undid his belt and slightly pushed down his pants. X then continued to have gay sex with no time for me to consent. He came in closer to whisper in my ear, “If your gay then why aren’t you enjoying this.” He then continued until he finished, and I started crying. After he had gay sex with me, he held me stroking my hair as I continued to cry, this tortured me I never felt able to speak out about it because he made me feel safe in a way. It ruined my relationships because it almost felt out of love he did what he did. After a while he stopped holding me, he got changed and left. After he left, I got changed, covered in bruises and a crushing pain in my ribs I left for my PE lesson. The day after, he threatened to kill me if I spoke out & he went on to rape and assault many people. I blame myself for what happened to them every day. Others spoke out I did not, the school does their best to cover up what happened to us. They have a reputation to protect as this is extremely important for them as they are a private school. I then went on to self-harm almost every night. With a couple of suicide attempts along with it. Then two and a half years after the first incident when I was 15. The same boy beat me up in front of a group of people for no reason, aware to me. I told a friend about this incident who had been hurt sexually by [name omitted to preserve anonymity] I was called into the safeguarding lead’s office, she had built a reputation for covering shit up, where I was forced to tell her what happened about the second incident. Now I am still haunted by him. Scared for my life. Scared to be who I am, as someone who is pansexual who is non-binary because of what this boy did to me. I am angry and yet disappointed in myself for not being able to speak.",MARCH 28 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"When I was in first year of University, I kissed a guy on a night out in the students union. When I left to go home he kept asking to come with me and I said no, but he followed me and my friends back to our flat. I refused to let him in and left him outside. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he got into the building and someone let him into the flat, which really annoyed me. He would not leave me alone or take no for an answer. I wouldn't let him in my bedroom but he kept picking me up/pinning me to the sofa and trying to touch me and calling me a prude or whatever. He was really, really strong and I actually could not physically push him off which was pretty scary and I can still remember the panic even though it was [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Don't remember how, but I did manage to make him stop and he did leave but it has always stuck with me. The worst thing was my flatmates were aware of what was happening and did nothing to stop it or help. I bumped into him at a later date and realised he had given me a fake name which I also thought was just weird and creepy and added to him being an all-round not great person.",MARCH 27 2023,SCOTLAND
"When I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] , my mum and dad were split up so every two weekends I would go round to my dad’s house where he lived with his wife and her son . It was that long ago and I was that young that now I hardly remember any good , funny memories with my dad’s family . But every day , I get constant flashbacks ( not PTSD ) to the times when me and my then stepbrother would have finished dinner and I would run upstairs as quick as I could and hide behind my curtains above my bed from him . I never understood how he kept finding me but it was because it was my ONLY hiding spot . It sounds like a normal harmless game of Hide and Seek but it really wasn’t . I never ran laughing . I never ran while he counted . I ran to get away from him so he wouldn’t force me to do stuff I didn’t like . I ran because I knew I would feel pressured into doing it as I was young and never knew I could say no . Once he ‘ found ‘ me , he would say roundabouts , “ Come on , it’s only for a second . I’ll do it back to you once you’ve done it ! “ I would then imply , with my reasoning above , and he would force me to kiss him wherever he asked and there was one spot he enjoyed me kissing the most . Very obvious where it was . I hated it . I didn’t even know it was and what it was called . But all this happened every day I was round wherever he could find a good hiding spot whether that was after dinner , in my little play tent , in my parents bed or anywhere else . It still haunts me [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because no one else knows ; not even my own dad and I trust and love him more than anything , nor my boyfriend who has stuck with me through everything . There were multiple other times when I was young including when I was 11 when I went to the cinema with my Auntie and she left me with a friend , a boy , a few years older who wouldn’t stop stroking my face even when I said no so I went out to my Auntie and told her I hated the film then after many months building up the hatred , terror and courage I told my mum and now I never see that boy anymore . I was also 13 roundabout when my dad had a different girlfriend who had two sons ; one bratty 12 year old and a slobbery but cute 3 year old . I only got on with the younger one as I would have constant arguments over unnecessary stuff with the older one but one day when me and the older brother were play fighting in the bunk bed he flipped me , pinned me and sat on top of me . I could feel him attempting to dry hump me while I was still stuck but I wriggled out and he pretended like nothing happened , probably hoping I didn’t notice but I did and I couldn’t sleep that night . [date omitted to preserve anonymity] from now , I had a year long boyfriend and I thought he was amazing at the time but slowly he started to show his true dark colours where he would mentally , sexually and emotionally abuse me . He would constantly want to do sexual acts like play with me or me ‘ help ‘ him finish and if I was ever not in the mood he would get angry and then get upset with me to which I felt like I had to comply with him because his excuse was we cuddle all the time and we never do what I want or if I genuinely never gave in he would suggest and start watching porn because he assumed it would turn me on every time and it never did but I wanted him to shut up so I would ‘ help ‘ him . One time we were messing around and he attempted to try and start fingering me even though he never asked or told me he was going to and I started telling him I didn’t want that and he was trying to convince me it would be okay and that it wouldn’t harm anyone so he carried on thinking I was find with it then . I then started crying because the forcefulness and the words coming out of his mouth felt familiar but he didn’t care and he started getting angry again and ignoring me while blaming me telling me I didn’t say I didn’t want it . Online harassment is also a thing . I have also experienced this where who I thought was an alright mate asked me for nudes and I would get something in return . I never sent him nudes but I sent something suggest full where I was lying in bed but he kept asking for more but I told him there was no more than that . Even though I sent him the picture and it was kind of my fault I still felt peer pressured and horrible afterwards so I told my friend and he was completely on my side . I am telling you , rape is not always sexual assault / harassment . Blackmailing , guilt tripping , forcing are also slight examples of sexual assault . Do not be afraid to tell anyone or it will stick with you forever . Do not be afraid to say no and stick to no or it could lead to significant mental issues . Having someone by your side is not always a bad thing . They can help and stick by you . Even if you were slightly in the wrong , someone by your side is always mentally helpful .",MARCH 26 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

I don't know if this really counts but a boy at school had been touching me and hugging me and making me uncomfortable for literal months but I didn't know how to say no because he had asked me out before that and I said no and he got really upset. A [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he decided to take it a step further and put his hand on my leg under the desk. He then tried to grab my boob later in the lesson saying he was finding a pressure point. I didn't report him cause I felt like it was my fault for not saying no but then the next lesson he started stroking my bum whenever he walked past me and my friend made me tell a teacher who made me tell safeguarding. Nothing was done about it for a week so I told the teacher that nothing had been done and now he's trying to deal with it himself. I really struggle with feeling guilty about it and like I did the wrong thing and that in a way he had a right to do that cause I never said no even tho i know he didn't have a right. Also I feel even worse cause before all this happened he was my friend so I'm grieving the end of that friendship at the same time as coming to grips with what happend and that I shouldn't want to be his friend and that he was probably manipulating me the whole time anyways,MARCH 26 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

She said I wanted it, and that it was my fault he had done it. She never broke up with him, and soon after my grandfather started doing it too.

"Man where do I start. In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] [date omitted to preserve anonymity] cooking class, a boy in my class grabbed my bum. I was only trying to get a spoon. His girlfriend then burst into laughter and that’s when I found out it was a dare. I felt so violated, it felt like I was naked in-front of the whole school, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I didn’t tell any teacher, I didn’t know where to start or what to say, or what they would do. I didn’t even know if there was anything to be done I instead kept my mouth shut. I later found out the same person (in year [date omitted to preserve anonymity]) also violated my friend. As she was handing out books she leaned over his desk, and that’s when he took the opportunity to grope her boob, this time he was caught by a teacher as she was luckily watching, he was then punished. After my GCSEs I went to a sixth form. It was a very tight knit school and I felt like I didn’t fit in. In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I found out a guy I liked was interested in me and I perused the relationship, it felt nice to be recognised and accepted. Though after we broke up, on a second glance I realised the relationship was sour. He had taken advantage of me. I felt manipulated and used. I had come out of the hospital high on anaesthetic from my procedure. I wanted him to be with me and he obliged coming to my house. There we laughed and joked about how high and out of it I was, he commented on how my pupils were huge. We then went to my room and cuddled nothing new, but as it does it progressed and he was trying to penetrate me. I learnt that I couldn’t have consented because of my state, I felt violated and used, really upset. I felt let down, we had discussed the consequences of my anaesthetic, how I couldn’t consent to anything legal because I want sober. consent is often mentioned in school, but only the stereotypical examples of no means no, never that someone who isn’t sober can’t consent, I felt let down. Later after our break up - which was for other reasons, I discovered before we were a couple he asked his sexualised me behind my back, asking his friends if they would “fuck that” when I was out of earshot. Who knows what else they discussed. This particularly is the most difficult part, I struggle to trust people when they mention the talk about me with friends. I don’t know what else he said, what else they discussed and what they know about me that I thought was private and confidential. He violated me in so many ways but most of all my trust. It’s hard knowing someone who was so kind and loving was in private so horrible and destructive. I was going through a lot at the time and he would often comment on how strong I was, how I was the strongest person he knows and how he was proud of me. I’ve never told my mum that I’ve been raped I don’t know how to, it feels too private. There is so much more to this situation, but these are the essential, bare bones parts. To who ever reads this, you are strong and I am proud of you, don’t let what they did define you. You are more than that. In time you will heal and grow but until then talk to people, always always talk. If not a teacher or parent, talk to your trusted friends xxx",MARCH 24 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
At school the toilets are unisex. This guy told me to come into the cubicle with him. I agreed as we were mates and I thought he just wanted to vape together. When I’m there he locked the door and approached me. I asked what he was doing. He then continued to say that I needed to stop playing with him and slipped his hand under my shirt and grabbed my tit. I told him to stop and he didn’t listen. I then pushed him away and he got the other side of the cubicle. He was then really mad and slapped and purposely hit my tit.

"I was in a relationship with him for 2 and a half years. It was about a year into our relationship that he assaulted me for the first time. We were laughing and kissing and then he suddenly pushed me onto the bed, pinned my hands behind my back and started touching me through my underwear. I kind of just froze, I went still and let myself dissociate and as he was doing it he said ""I can't tell if you've stopped moving because you want it or because you've given up"". I hear those words in my head multiple times a day, horrible, degrading, humiliating words. The second time I'd just come out of the shower, I laid down on my bed because I was dizzy from how hot the water had been and he laid down next to me and pushed my towel down to start groping my chest, I told him to stop, said no multiple times even going as far as to say ""no, I don't want that"" but he didn't stop, just slapped my hands away and kept groping me. I stayed with him after all that. I let him cheat on me, manipulate me, guilt trip me and mentally drain me. My breaking point was when he raped my other boyfriend (it was a polyamorous relationship), after I found out what he'd done I broke up with him and shortly after found out he'd also sexually abused the person he cheated on me with. Me, my boyfriend and his other victim reported him to our youth group and got him kicked out of it, but all my friends from the youth group have taken his side, keep referring to what he's done as a ""mistake"" and a ""misunderstanding"". I feel so betrayed and empty all the time now, I want to be high or drunk or just anything but sober all the time. The most fucked up thing about it to me is that I don't want to talk about it, I rehearse what happened in my head all the time but the idea of talking about It any more than I have is so scary, because as long as I keep it to myself it can't get twisted, it stays my story and nobody else can force their opinion on what he did on me.",MARCH 21 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

And since we were pretty much in the same class throughout school he would follow me to where I would hang out and chase me so he would hug me tight and bring his friend to make me feel pressured to hug him back. Then my teachers changed seating plans and they put me next to him since he asked them, and that was when it really started to get worse since he would bring me gifts and in return he would expect something which I refused then in classes he begun to feel me up like grabbing my inner thighs in class and staring at my chest and always had his eyes on me. And during science practicals he would ""accidentally"" trip and grab my chest multiple times and I was happy that a girl who I didn't know stood up for me I was thankful someone spoke up for me. But it continued anyway since he would follow me and I would feel his eyes on mine. Then online he began getting worse saying vulgar things and how he felt when he saw me at school which made me feel even more hyperaware of what he would do if he caught me alone. I would lock myself in bathrooms at breaktimes since he knew where I usually went and I just never came into school much. Then he began threatening me online and because I was a stupid kid I gave into those threats and gave him nudes which he then threatened me more with and he sent them to his friends and I never felt more humiliated. I was only 14. I mustered the courage to just block him on everything and speak to teachers in private to let me sit somewhere else and I ignored him in school and always had someone with me since he would try to get me alone. I'm so glad I finished school. But everyday I go to work I have to drive past where he works and I see him. I only decided to write this since he made an alternate account and added me again. I blocked him.",MARCH 17 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

"I was in my third year at university and had recently split up with a boyfriend of seven years. I had gone on a night out with some girlfriends and bumped into a new, male friend who I had only started socialising with. I did fancy him so spent some time in the club flirting and having a couple of drinks. I had been drinking so I was drunk, but all of a sudden I was incredibly drunk and not in control. My memory of the whole night is very hazey. I’m not insinuating he put anything in my drink, I had been drinking and at the time I was going off the rails and was drinking a lot so it is very likely that I had drunk too much. The next thing I woke up in a room that I didn’t recognise and I was completely naked. I realised I was sharing the bed with someone and was actually relieved when I saw it was him and not a complete stranger. I asked him if we had had sex [date omitted to preserve anonymity] to which he replied with a yes so calmly as if it was all fine. I do not remember leaving the club, let alone arriving at his house and being undressed! At the time I was in a really low place and had no self-esteem. And I am ashamed to say that I had consensual sex with him in the morning. At the time, I didn’t understand the severity of what had happened and I was just grateful I wasn’t alone. It’s been a few years now and it’s something I think about a lot. I blame myself for not seeing what was wrong with it and sleeping with him in the morning. As I can’t remember the night at all, I also constantly wonder what happened during the period of time between leaving the club and waking up. I question myself all the time about how things could have happened - how did I get up the stairs, how did I get undressed, how could I have had sex?! I’ve been reading a lot on unacknowledged rape which is where this meets the legal definition of rape but at the time the victim (me) didn’t see it in that way and saw it as a misunderstanding or a bad night. I am still very confused about the whole thing. I don’t think he is a bad person but what happened was wrong. We continued to be friends and classed it as a one-night stand.",MARCH 07 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"im in year 10, i recently dated a boy in the year below lasting about 3 months. one day he invited me to his house and we made out (consensually), things were fine but everytime i would say can we slow down he wouldn’t and just kept on going , and at one point he even pinned me down under him making out but i openly pushed him away but he just didn’t get off, in the end I turned my face away multiple times and just said can we not do it like this. He was clearly a little bit unhappy. He also kept trying to get into my bra but I said no but he kept trying so I was like not [date omitted to preserve anonymity], this went on for the whole evebubg. Then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] we met up at his house again and it was just bad. Like we made out consensually at first but then he kept pushing and pushing for me to sit on top of him in a specific position. Like and make out that way, he did it to me but I kept saying maybe not or finding excuses but he still did it . We couldn’t even watch the TV because he would not get his hands off me for two minutes and just watch the film. Then later on he kept using this excuse saying people form school have said we should do this or that etc etc and then said they’re saying I should finger you, I said maybe not [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because it’s a bit too soon. Then he proceeded to show me his hard penis and put my hand on it. I left it there a for a few seconds because I felt bad and then took it away. I was uncomfortable and tried to get him to put it away but he kept trying to make out with his penis outside his pants while on me but I kept pushing him away saying maybe put it away. Eventually he put it away, thank goodness but he kept trying to get inside my bra , I was wearing an open neck top so he could feel my chest, not boobs, I was okay with this, but wasn’t tooo keen. Then he kept going inside my bra and I would put my hand over it so he couldn’t get to my nipple or anything but he kept trying to move my hand and kiss it. It was actually disgusting but there was genuinely nothing I could’ve done . Like this kept going on, eventually he just restrained my hands and said wait a minute you’ll love this and proceeded to kiss my boobs and stuff. Like I genuinely didn’t want this, but he kept doing it, i also kept saying maybe later maybe later to try and delay it. I understand I never said ‘ no’ to the boob stuff but I said maybe another day and I was clearly uncomfortable and told him to please slow things down. Eventually 10 mins before dinner I told him maybe u should wait for ur penis to go floppy because ur parents might see. He then said his parents wouldn’t mind, so I was like but it won’t look good on me and it’s important for them to like me. He stopped the boob and penis stuff but kept pressuring me to make out and get on top of him. I did it once to make him happy and so he would stop asking. And then dinner came. After dinner I used breath bot smelling nice and using that as an excuse, he bought it but kept pressuring me, but I kept persisting with the excuse until my mum came to pick me up. Then at school this rumour that is did a hand job on him went round. I denied this and told one close friend (who doesn’t gossip at all) that he put my hand on his penis, not realising it was sexual assault until I got called in by the school . I only told them about the penis stuff as that was what was reported and soet of defended the boy in a sense because she said she may have to get the police and my parents involved. Because I don’t get on well with a parent and couldn’t risk this coming out I defended the boy saying he just got too caught up in the moment and it was nothing serious. When he got interviewed about the penis stuff the school concluded that it was ‘experimentation’ that went a little too far. my reputation is trashed because of this and it’s horrible that he can just get away with this but I know I hould’ve said something when I was getting talked to.",MARCH 06 2023,ENGLAND
"After a 3 year abusive relationship at 17, I fell into a bad habit of sleeping with guys so I felt good about myself. This boy who I went to school with, who was 4 years older than I was messaged me on Instagram. He was a very popular boy and so I was surprised why he’d want to talk to me. We had the same humour and spoke for ages. After the small talk ended he got sexual and flirty and asked when I could go over his. I knew it was for sex which I was ok with so we arranged a day. When I arrived he started kissing me straight away and I instantly I felt out of my depth. I brushed him off with a joke and hoped he read the room. He did and we sat on the sofa and spoke for a while. Eventually he started again in a nicer way and after we did some things we went upstairs. We were kissing and he was doing things to me when he grabbed my neck and sat me up. He took his boxers down and said “ let’s see how good you are” I really didn’t want to, I felt panicked and thought he was coming on a bit too strong so I said no. He kept prompting me saying “that’s what you’re here for”I felt scared incase he didn’t like what I was saying, but he grabbed my head and forced my mouth on him, he was so aggressive but after a few times I managed to pull away. He turned me over and pinned me down and said “that’s how it’s going to be is it?” We then had really rough sex which hurt. I didn’t speak or make a noise, It was awkward when he stopped, he didn’t talk to me and left the room. He left me there with my face down, I got up, got changed, I looked back at the bed before going downstairs and there was my blood everywhere. When I got home I was still bleeding, I had bruises on my chest and neck. It took a week for the pain to stop. We haven’t spoken since.",MARCH 06 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"Frequently, boys encouraged each other to take photos of girls. The majority of these photos were angled towards skirts, which many girls expressed how uncomfortable it made them feel to both teachers and the students involved. Very little was done to resolve this, and the behaviour was excused. Personally, I was made aware of a group chat where boys discussed what they wanted to do with me in bed. I felt unable to approach teachers about this matter after hearing about other people’s experiences. In addition, one time in class we had a cover teacher. He told me to come up to the front of the class, which was not uncommon if they needed a student to run to the printer. When I reached the front of the class, he told me to grab the bottom of his shirt so he could take his jumper off. I panicked and did as he asked, as I was scared of questioning his authority. It was only after class that I felt ashamed and embarrassed, as the entire class was laughing and joking about the situation. I still don’t understand why he needed anyone to hold down his shirt, let alone a young girl. A few years passed, and we had an ‘own clothes day’ for charity. It was a fairly cold day and I was wearing dungarees. He saw me down the down the corridor, and started pulling on the waist area of my dungarees, laughing and joking about how I must be cold. Of course, I took this as a joke, but looking back on both situations I feel extremely disappointed in his behaviour as a teacher.",MARCH 05 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

He said weird sexual things as a “joke” but that’s just what boys my age do and I didn’t think much of it. [date omitted to preserve anonymity], it got a lot worse.

Then the conversation escalated A LOT - he starts talking about his looks and telling me to be honest everytime I say he’s not good looking. He then starts asking me how old would I want to be to have sex. We’re 12. I told him 16 at the youngest because I don’t want to be a teen mum and he replied with “I have a condom” he then continues to ask me about my boobs and then I half swiped and he asks me for a picture and I don’t open it because I don’t know what to say and he gets mad and tells me to stop being a beg and he was joking. He sent me a video of him jerking off. And he asked me if I wanted to have sex with him when we were 14. He changed it to 13 after, I said no the first time. He pressured me into saying yes. Saying “why?” “I want to do it with you tho” he keeps making weird sexual statements after I’ve made it obvious lots of time I don’t wanna talk to him, leaving him on delivered, not replying, making up excuses saying I have to go.

When we got back he guilt tripped me into staying in my own room, repeatedly saying, ""don't you trust me??"".

"I was 13 and outside of school I consented to a boy from same school (14-15) to kiss me in a park. Within what felt like seconds he had his hand in my knickers and was violently trying to finger me and I said to him no. I wasn’t confident as I was half frozen whilst saying it. He continued until I cried. I foolishly thought he just wanted to kiss me and he started having a go and made me feel stupid for only wanting to kiss. I had never even thought of anything else being on the radar at such a young age. He humiliated me called me frigid and I remember feeling so ashamed and feeling stupid for being young. He even said ‘I should have expected this from a [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 8’ He left and came back with his friends and they all laughed at me. He then unbuttoned his pants and tried to have sex with me. I froze and didn’t know how to react. I wish I could have pushed him/ kicked him/ screamed at him but I felt paralysed with fear and shock. It was probably only moments but this replays in my mind every day. I’m still trying to figure out what actually happened as I was so distressed I tried to blank it out but I think he did penetrate me. My knickers and jeans were covered in blood and I was so sore for days. I went back to school on the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and he had spread awful rumours about me and I was so ashamed. I was bullied and tormented about this for the rest of my time at school. On the week at school after the incident, my head of year pulled me out of my form class.

At this point I thought he was coming to me with concern however the teacher went on to say “I should watch what I get up to or I’ll get a reputation” I felt crushed, helpless and scared. After that day I faked an illness to my dad so I didn’t have to go back to school for a few of weeks. I remember lying in bed crying for days. I self harmed and never told anyone.

Even [date omitted to preserve anonymity] some people still refer to me as the girl who got fingered/shagged by person x. I wish I had the courage to allow this to be published but I’m still scared of the back lash. Unfortunately my incident was one of many and the victims were always made to feel dirty and disgusting by teachers, even the school nurse.

"This is my whole story. I’ve posted on here before but back then I was afraid, afraid of sharing my story because I was ashamed. But now I’m not because now I know it wasn’t my fault. When I was in primary school I was heavily bullied and only really had one friend at the time. This friend was in almost all of my classes which wasn’t an issue at the time really because well I thought she was my friend. She began being really creepy and obsessive later on that year, she would give me pens and pencils that she would boast about having fingered herself with, she would constantly grab at my private parts and play it off as ‘a joke’ but I knew it wasn’t. Then we had swimming together and we had to change in front of our peers but she dragged me behind a wall on the other side of the changing rooms. She proceeded to touch me and grab at me and push me against the wall to hold me in place. She forced me down to feel at her parts and forced me to do very sexual things. She did this about 7 times and I never told anyone. She told me never to tell anyone anything because ‘real friends keep secrets’. I soon got her out of my life luckily and I could not be happier. But this was secondary school and bullying was so much worse. I told one of my friends who proceeded to belittle me and tell me ‘that’s not even a big deal if you’re even telling the truth’. I felt disgusted and ashamed and I just felt dirty. I felt that I couldn’t get the feeling of her hands off of me. I felt like I could never be clean. From a young age I had been self harming and this only got worse. Just when I felt I was getting over it something happened again. I went out on my own late at night to go get myself a small drink and snack from the shops because I couldn’t sleep and the corner shop didn’t shut. When I was walking out I got pulled into this alleyway. This man pushed me against the wall and pinned me there. He touched me, groped me, he made me take his d*ck down my throat and almost r*ped me but I kicked him a lot in a final attempt to get away and I did. I ran for over an hour as he chased me and I finally got away. I don’t feel safe anywhere ever. It’s even harder because I’m trans, and I feel like if I was just born a boy then there would be less of a chance this would happen to me. I feel like I will never be a boy because I was touched in that way.

I witnessed a girl with learning disabilities be constantly harassed by a boy from year 7 - year 11 he would jokingly ask her out, call her fit and make lude comments until her mother finally complained just to be told “oh that’s just *name*” and face no punishment. The girl even stop him to stop and he began to commit these offences to other students only backing off if a boy was involved. I also faced repeated harassment and assault by a specific individual who would choke me out, pull me onto his lap, grope me and even stole my shoe just for people including teachers to watch and do nothing. Several students spread others nudes with people even having sex at school. Sixthform students (16-18) also used to engage in relationships and sexual activities with those in year 8-9 (12-13) and this was normalised. I was once made fun of for not wanting to have sex at 13. The school knew of these relationships. Sexual assault, misogyny and violence against women is a massive issue at [location omitted to preserve anonymity] as well as homophobia. 12-13 year olds are being pressured into having sex and sending nudes and the school fails to act or prevent this. They deserve to be on this list.",FEBRUARY 21 2023,UNITED KINGDOM

"I was 15 and at one of my best friend's birthday parties. There were a lot of people there who I didn't know and I was drinking and I believe my drink was spiked. To this day, I'll never be able to be 100% sure whether I was or not and that's a really hard thing for me. There was a guy and we started doing stuff which was initially consensual. I was extremely drunk but I thought it was fine for a bit. By the time we were having sex, I was in and out of consciousness. I was very obviously in no state to consent or understand what was going on. I still don't remember how or exactly what happened. He left me in the room as soon as he was done to go downstairs to his friends and boast that he'd lost his virginity. Meanwhile, I took myself to the bathroom, in a completely shocked and distraught state and luckily was eventually taken away from the party by my friends. He texted me the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] saying he'd heard I was upset and asking why. I told him I couldn't remember exactly what had happened and asked did I need to get Plan B. He told me yes, I definitely should. I didn't really know what had happened. It's only a year on that I've started processing things a bit. I don't like using the word rape but instead sexual assault because that word still feels to scary to me. For a while, I just described it as 'dodgy sex' because I didn't think or want it to be a big deal. I am so angry and upset for my younger self.",FEBRUARY 21 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"I have the hat trick in sexual assault and rape. My first assault being when I was around 15 years old. I had been drinking down the park and woke up to a peer with his hands in my pants. Then i was raped by a male in my own home. He stalked and harassed me, picking up all my friends and isolating me. Even my parents liked him and insisted he was my boyfriend. Denying it was laughed off as being shy…. I am not shy. Next was the night I took drugs. Two males walked past me and invited me to a house party. It wasn’t a house party. I woke the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] covered in my own blood, and just walked home. I remember him asking my age because he was considerably older. A few years pass and I’m in a long term relationship. I’m happy. You don’t acknowledge people grabbing your bum on a night out. That’s nothing. But at last I was happy and my vulnerable days were over. Until they weren’t. In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I went on a hen do with a large crowd of friends. At the end of the night the stag of a party who we had made friends with asked if I would walk back with him ahead of the others as he really wanted to get back. As the stag and a police officer, I had no reason not to trust him. Of course we got back and almost instantly he pinned me down. I had to pretend to be sick to get him off. He did get off. He also apologised the following day. Unfortunately the most recent assault triggered all of my historical trauma, which I really hadn’t dealt with. My friends and family barely recognised me. I almost lost my relationship and my home because of my spiralling behaviour. I never reported anything to the police. Partly because when I was younger I didn’t actually realise what had happened to me. I have never reported the policeman because I will be branded a slag. Instead I worked hard to better my mental health and understand trauma. I work as a nurse and I work with victims/survivors of violence against women and girls (VAWG). One thing I wish someone told me when I was at my worst: It does get better.",FEBRUARY 20 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"It happened [date omitted to preserve anonymity] in [place omitted to preserve anonymity] and he was one of my guy friends who I thought I could trust. we were all at my friends house drinking and I got very drunk very quick so I decided to lay down on the sofa cause I was practically out of it.

I tried to get him off of me and he wouldn't get off as he was to heavy and I was to drunk. my friends at the end of the night pulled me off when I was sobering up and realised what the hell was going on. however it didn't stop there , he then called his sister and said ""I'm going to shag (my name)"" I was upstairs in bed and so afraid hiding under the covers. he tried to come upstairs multiple times and find me however my other guy friends were guarding the stairs and were pushing him down, if it wasn't for them I'm afraid what he would've done as this isn't the first time he has SA a girl. my school found out and [name omitted to preserve anonymity] did not do anything , he has had no form of punishment and it makes me so mad he's been able to get away with this again.",FEBRUARY 20 2023,UNITED KINGDOM
"It was my boyfriend. Before we even dated he pressured me into sending nudes as multiple times I said I didn't want to as this was all new for me, when I finally did he decided to show his friends whiteout asking me or even telling me. It got worse we had been dating for a while and there had been incidents where he would make me fell guilty enough that id have to have sex with him otherwise he would be angry , I used to think this was normal and now I know its not and can be is SA. There would be times I would of said no multiple times and he would roll over and not speak to me the rest of the day or he would walk out and say I never want to have sex which made me feel guilty enough that I ended up giving into it and have sex. There was one incident when we were at his and I told him I didn't want to do anything he the continued to get my hand and push it down his trousers multiple times I said no and he still tried and made me touch him, he then gave up and proceeded to try and pull down my trousers after I pushed he hand away he touched me. when I spoke to him about it he pushed my feelings aside and said it wasn't a big deal and that's what couples do, I listened to him and believed it was normal.

I was exhale assaulted at an after school field trip by one of the eighth graders at my school when I was in seventh grade.I haven’t told anybody yet but it has made me have very low self esteem for myself,,
I was raped when I was 15 by someone I thought I could trust. I was too drunk and vulnerable and he took advantage. I had never had sex before or been in any sexual contact with a mans genitals so it was a real shock for me. I feel like I grew up and fell apart over night. It’s taken me many years to come to terms with and not be detrimentally affected by it. It changed the course of so much of my life at a time when I was already vulnerable and alone.,,
"I was 14 and my boyfriend at the time was very nice and would never pressure me into doing anything. i gave him a hand job a couple of times and he fingered me once or twice, but i made it clear i did not want to have sex yet. after we had been together for about 8 months and i was 15 he started mentioning sex more and kept talking about it, but i said i’m not ready, to which he replied “it’s not deep but ok.” over the next couple of months this got worse and worse to the point that he would try to put his penis in me if we were doing bits and were naked, and when u confronted he would be sweet and act very sorry. i cant believe i was so naive to not realise how had this was. the main event this is about happened when we had been together for about 10 months and we were at a party. i was very drunk to the point i was nearly blacking out, and he was fully sober because i drank before the party but he didn’t and there were no drinks there. he asked me to go to a room and i didn’t say anything but i went with him. when we were there he said we are having sex and i said no laughing in my drunken state. he forcefully took off all my clothes and put his pen inside of me. i started crying and was trying hard to resist but he wouldn’t stop. he then finished all over me and i just sat there crying for hours. it’s been a year and i’ve only told my closest friends but the fact he’s had no consequences makes me sick and i don’t think i’ll ever be the same again.",,
"after saying no many times a boy coerced me into “going upstairs” with him and raped me while i cried and bled and repeatedly asked him to stop.

"""Through the ages 8-12 I was molested and groped by my step sister each night I stayed over as our parents would put our beds in the same room, it was pre puberty and I was clueless that being sexual was a thing and passed it off as a ‘game’ after some years I realised what was happening and I’ve tried again and again since then to get it out of my mind but it’ll never leave - it really did scar me and made me have an innate fear of being touched by anyone around me to this day I even tried to force a kink out of it to Cope but I feel disgusted at the thought (he/him)""",,

"When I was 14, I began high school. I met this boy in the next grade, we talked for months.

He pushed me on the bed, I couldn’t stop it because I was already starting to blackout and I felt so weak. At 14, I had a pregnancy scare. No one should go through this.",,
Many boys at the school think its funny to assault young girls. (Grab their butts and the other stuff),,

"Instances of harassment and misogyny are too many to detail here so I'll write about the one that sticks best in my memory from about ten years ago.,During my postgraduate degree another male postgraduate in our group of uni friends developed a crush on me. We got on well but I made it clear to him I was not interested. He started hanging out with my flatmate as a way to get to me until she broke off their friendship when she realised he was using her.,Once, on a night out, he snuck up groped my breasts. I froze. He giggled and ran away. I left the club in tears and very angry. He then emailed me the next day telling me that he was sorry but he felt entitled to do this because I was a tease and he had liked me for ages and he was drunk and could we ""keep it between the two of us? That was the last straw and I threatened him with violence.,I showed the email to my close friends in our department. Only one girl really supported me in the way my flatmate had. Sadly, I found out that this was a pattern for this person - he had been harassing a woman who sat next to him before he moved on to me. He attempted the same thing with another close friend of mine but she shut him down very quickly - I had made a point of describing my experience with this man to as many colleagues as possible. With hindsight I wish I had taken it further.,It sounds insane to write this now, but It was only talking about my experiences years later with another group of friends that I actually realised I'd been victimised and sexually assaulted. At the time it never occurred me to report this to anyone - and if it had, I probably wouldn't have as I have little faith anything would be taken seriously. I have no idea if my university or funding body had a policy.,I've been a lot luckier than many of the women and girls posting on here - and how fucked up is that?!",,
"In year 9, one day I was in the queue for lunch by myself, and about four boys from my year, significantly taller than me where stood behind me in a group. It made me feel anxious but I didn’t think anything of it. Until, I felt a hand touch underneath my skirt. I froze, because I wasn’t quite sure what was happening. but then I quickly looked back to see the boy directly behind me retract his arm from behind me and smile at me innocently while the rest boys laughed, looking at my backside. I got my food, embarrassed, feeling violated. They were still behind me in the queue to pay. I felt awful for the rest of the day. I didn’t know what to do. They where a popular group of boys, and I didn’t talk to them at all and knew it would only make things worse if I told anyone. So I didn’t. And it made me even more terrified of the boys in my school than before. I made sure if i ever went to queue for lunch, I would go with a friend, but I mostly just stopped getting food altogether to avoid a situation like that again.",,
"i was young and easy manipulated. i was in an extremely toxic relationship where i was gaslighted and emotionally abused. i was forced into sex ‘so he wouldn’t cheat on me’ or ‘because i’d enjoy it when we started’ . i have not confronted him or told anyone about it . he does not realised what he did and i would not be believed. after him ending that relationship a year or so later i moved on and found myself in a similar position. he continuously tried to have sex with me over and over and i would refuse and he would attempt it multiple times where i had to shove him off of me. i was 13,14 and 15 when i was assaulted each time. since then i have been sexually assaulted once and sexually harassed multiple times when i leave the house",,
"In high school, I was assaulted several times by several guys. They made it very clear my choice never mattered to them. They tried to break me into being an ""obedient slut"" because they were all perverted weeks who watched to much hentai.",,
"In year 9 I used to wear a skort every time I had sport, which was basically everyday. I’d wear it on the school bus home and I really didn’t think anything of it. Teachers warned the girls houses that we had to wear trousers on the bus home to cover up, which I completely understand but don’t at the same time. It doesn’t feel right that we have to cover up just because men can’t keep it in their pants and they get to easily “distracted”, as if it’s my problem/fault. Anyways back to wearing the skort on the bus issue.... My house mistress would complain to me everyday how I should stop wearing my skort on the bus and insist that I needed to cover up. I was convinced that my bus driver, who was a man at the time, was telling people before informing my house mistress about this “issue”. Ever since then I have felt so insecure about showing my body and legs because of such an issue, that seems so small.",,
"I will never understand why the girls laugh and even join in when the boys in my school consistantly make sexist and derogatory jokes about them and other females in the school. I remember one day sitting in maths and a boy who sat next to me said ""well he wanked to your picture last night"". Comments like these were what completely ruined mine and my best friends friendship and I myself feel partly responsible because if i wasn't a girl then the jokes about us would never have been made. I have heard even more things like this since and to try to 'protect' me, my bestfriend has now cut off contact. Even though we never talk anymore comments and 'jokes' are still said. I lost a great friendship over boys who think they are more important than everyone else.",,
"I was on the bus on the way to or from school (I cannot remember) with people I had known since lower school. A group of us, more boys than girls were sat a the back of the bus and one of the boys who I thought was one of my friends just reached out and grabbed my breasts and squeezed them in front of everyone, pretending that the movement of the bus had made him fall on to me. They also used to play a 'game' called cock or balls where they would expose themselves but it was just a joke or funny game to them, so it did not matter if it made us uncomfortable.",,
"my dad used to coach a football team and i would often go down to watch my brother play for the team on Saturdays. once, after a game, we were sat on the benches outside with a few other people and boys from the team. i was maybe around 13 years old. this man was in his late teens or early 20s and he was already making gross jokes about women walking past. everyone was laughing. then, he started swearing and one of the women from the bar told him to stop because ""there's a little girl here"". he turned to me and at first said sorry. then, with a disgusting smirk, ""we'll you're not really a little girl are you?"" i was wearing a skirt and was well-aware my body had matured at an early age. i felt sick but no one seemed to notice what he had said. i don't believe they hadn't heard him, they just didn't care to say anything. afterwards, all my dad says was that he was a cheeky lad. most boys on that team were lovely, but he made me feel more hesitant. i became superaware everytime i went to watch my brother and tried to avoid all the men. i was paranoid someone would do or say something.",,
"I relatively close friends with this guy. We hadn’t seen each other in a while and the summer when I was 17 he said come to mine I’m having some people over. I was really excited to see everyone. When I arrived he had arranged for all the friends to leave - so it was just me and him. He said he wanted to show me something upstairs so I went with him. He then grabbed my wrist, pulled me onto the bed and starting trying to take my clothes off. He was a lot stronger than me so I had to use all my force to pull away. When I said “I don’t want to do that, that’s not why I came - I see you as a friend” he lost it. He started screaming for me to get out of his house and to never speak to him again. He was embarrassed that I said no. So I ran out of house and all the way home - ashamed and terrified. When I saw him again he acted like nothing happened but I was still scarred from that incident.",,
"I was 11 and it started in the summer after I finished primary school and was due to go to big school. A male relative crept into my bedroom, touched me and pressed himself against me. He kept saying I was so beautiful and it was my fault for looking the way I did. He said he would hurt my mum and I thought I had to to protect her. I tried to block it out by singing songs in my head. He got me to hold my nightie up I cried so hard each time. I felt to blame. I hadn’t seen him in a while as he had been away. I told him I missed him and he asked how much and seemed to take that as a green light. I started cutting myself and became anorexic. I felt no one cared or saw the pain I was in. In secondary school they thought this was just me and never asked why - no one did. I felt if I told anyone others would suffer or he would move on to one of my siblings. It went on for months and stopped as suddenly as it had started. I still suffer depression and low self esteem and have taken numerous overdoses. I drink too much and don’t respect myself. I wish I’d never been born.",,
"I had just moved to uni and my new flat mate persuaded me to drink way past my limit and then asked if I wanted to go into my room to watch a film. He then tried to tough me and I moved his hand away multiple times and said no at least 6 times. He continued trying until I gave up as I knew I wasn’t getting out of this and I was too drunk to make a proper decision. He made me feel dirty and used. When I told my boyfriend at the time about what happened, he accused me of cheating, said it was my fault and that I was weak, a whore, a slut, a cunt and that my family should abandon me.",,
"In a mathematics class we had a seating plan that was boy/girl. I complained about the boy I sat next to every. single. day. He started off with inappropriate comments, quickly moving on to grabbing my hand and forcefully putting it on his penis. Then he put his hand in my crotch and rubbed me, all whilst I protested. The teacher finally noticed this one and took my complaints seriously... By letting me move seats. At the time I was happy with that resolution but in hindsight it's amazing that he got into no trouble at all for repeated sexual assaults!",,
"this happened a few years back. there was a teacher that would constantly make me uncomfortable because he would touch my skirt, give non consented hugs, and he would make me sit infront of his desk even when we had flexible seating.",,
"I was with my ex-boyfriend for nearly two years, when we first started the relationship I felt this rush that we had sex. As one of the first serious relationships in our year it was almost forced that we hadn’t had sex by the boys in our year. I felt some pressure to give myself up and just do it because all the boys would be like “you still haven’t beat yet, it has only been 2 months”. I was 14 at the time I wasn’t ready for anything yet and I guess I put myself in that position because I got into a relationship. We clicked instantly we had the best chemistry and got on so well, so I trusted him and I trusted that what we did wasn’t going to be told to anyone as it is private and I said to him please don’t tell anyone I don’t want anyone to know. I go to school on the Monday and people are coming up to me saying “how was it” before I had even spoken to him that day. I went straight to the toilets and cried because everyone was talking about it. During the relationship because we had done so much stuff earlier on I felt he would get bored of me and would try things I didn’t want to do nor were ready to do. He would always ask let’s try this and when I would be like “I am not sure yet”, he would move me and put me in that position anyway. Constantly during the relationship I would say no or not be in the mood to have sex and would feel like because I was in the relationship I had to do it. There was another time where he wanted to try something new and i wasn’t sure and told him I am not sure, I told him please stop it is hurting pushing with all my force against his shoulder to get him away from me but he said “I am in now I might as well carry on” and “it’s just a bit of pain, do it for me”. He would ask I can stop if you want me to but I knew from experiences before that with him that he would be grumpy or make me feel guilty. Another time was when I said no and he said “when you say no it means yes”, I said to him that this doesn’t mean that and when I say no it means no. There was another when I wasn’t in the mood and I think I had only said I wasn’t in the mood and I probably didn’t make it clear enough but that day he would put his whole body weight on me and I would struggle, I nearly cried and was in shock laying there on his bed while after he was done he just went to sleep. There were also multiple times when he would make me feels so guilty by saying “I am so horny and you’re my girlfriend you should want to have sex with me” or “you don’t like me anymore do you?”and I would just feel like I had to give in and say fine just get it over with. There were times so that he didn’t feel upset I would let him have sex with me and I would just tell myself it will be over soon. These are just a few times. When we got out of the relationship, I told a close friend what had happened she told me that is wasn’t right and that I need to speak to someone about it, she was disgusted and she was the one who made me realise that what had happen to me was not right at all. When I think back to these times, my heart aches like it is now, IT ACTUALLY ACHES. I can’t explain how I felt during the first lockdown I thought because no one believes or would believe me that I had to deal with the whole situation myself so I did. I cried every day and night, I cried whilst drifting off to sleep and this happened for about 2 months. I finally opened up to my mum and told her exactly what happened. I also opened up to friends who were and are friends with him and told them about what had happened to me. I didn’t explain in depth because I didn’t feel like I needed to as I thought that they would believe me straight away but I was wrong. I told the wrong person and then it got back to my ex. This then caused him and I to have a conversation where he admitted to himself and I that he had pressured me, but then till this day tells everyone the opposite making me feel and seem like a liar and someone who is doing this all for attention. After this conversation he went downstairs to the party where he had found out and this then started to speak to my friends and tell them that he didn’t do anything to me. This was then left till the next weekend when I was at goose green with my new school friends and my friends who were still friends with him came along I specifically asked them to not bring him along, yet he proceeded to come along and then threatened me that he would come to my house and speak to my parents. He then told his mum and this caused my mum and his mum to have a phone call. His mum on the phone told me that I need to get over him and that I was still in love with him after my mum had told her what he had done to me. She then proceeded to tell my mum what drugs I had done and how I would be drunk a lot of the time (this was because I was so hurt and confused of why he would do things like that to me) as if it was part of the conversation almost to say I was in the wrong and I was asking for it. She also proceeded to say stuff about my mum and mine’s relationship and stuff that I told her in private about my mum and how we didn’t get along. It was almost like I was doing everything wrong and that I was in the wrong. A day later she photocopies all of the letters I had sent my ex and put them in a letter saying and wrote that I was a beautiful woman and that I should move on from him, making it out like I was in the wrong for ever accusing her son of doing that. Meanwhile all of my friends were choosing who to believe and this made me feel like I was nothing and what had happened to me was nothing. Eventually they asked me to “tell the fully story then” and “explain myself”. They where either like “it’s bro code” or “I can’t pick a side because you’re both my friends”. I think that the most hurtful thing was that, my friends that I loved dearly not believing or trusting me. Things people have done/said to me who like and believe him: “you have ruined his life”, ashed their blem on me, given me death stairs, laughed at me on the street, “get out of our area”. I feel like I can’t tell my story because of how many people love him and trust him. It is the hardest thing to see someone who hurt you this live a happy life when you’re not living a happy life and you are the victim. It’s not only that he got away free and I will never be able to get away from what happened to me.",,
"Was seeing a boy from a school in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and was constantly pressured into giving him head, started crying because I didn’t want to but still pushed my head down, gave in but wasn’t enough for him so eventually he put it in without asking and then lied and said he didn’t. Has harassed me for years since",,
"I was sexually assaulted and then somehow my head of year found out.I told her what happened as I thought that the school could do something and as she had asked, implying she could help however it only lead to people finding out and it just getting worst.They couldn’t do anything as there was no evidence so I guess believe the victim doesn’t apply if you have no evidence..That does not make sense though how am I supppsed to vodeo myself getting sexually assaulted.I wasn’t aware I was going to be sexually assaulted.Schools should do more to help then always asking for evidence.",,
"I didn’t realise it wasn’t normal for boys to be so incredibly objectifying about girls. I didn’t really realise it wasn’t okay for boys to stare at my boobs when they’re even the slightest bit on show, or make constant comments about them. I didn’t realise it wasn’t okay for my male friend to motor boat me in front of all his friends with ZERO consent. I often feel like my body is not mine but made for the male gaze, and I feel like that’s normal.",,
"I was 17 and in bed with a boy I was talking to. We were kissing and he had made advances to finger me but I had stopped him. After a while, without asking, he shoved his finger up my vagina. It was painful. I know this isn’t as big as rape and other incidents, and basically happens to everyone, but it still makes me really uncomfortable and upset to think about.",,
"When I was 13 I was cycling back from a friend's house ,it was kinda late and the sun was setting .I was about halfway back when a group of older teenage boys on bikes who were obviously drunk started following me . I obviously freaked out but calmed myself down saying they were just cycling behind me ,that's when they started catcalling me and yelling how much they liked little girls like me and saying they would pay me and stuff like that . They followed me like this yelling at me to stop so that they could show me what a ""man"" was like .this was when I stopped at a Tesco dumped My bike outside and ran in .they followed me in and stood by the door waiting for me so I went to an employee who walked me out then waited by the door so that they couldn't follow me home.a couple of days later one of the boys was waiting outside my school and I realized that they must of seen that I was wearing my school uniform and waited for me .I ran back inside called the police who basically said I was paranoid .I didn't see the boy again but I was scared of him for years after and I lost trust in the police",,
"My boyfriend at the time would get really angry at me if I didn’t want to have sex with him (even after we had already had it once or twice that day) and I would say no and he would keep begging so I felt an obligation to do so, because he made me feel like if I didn’t “I didn’t love him”. To the point where I would literally be in tears because of how pressured I felt. Ive also had numerous different occasions from boys from private schools especially repeatedly pressuring me into doing something I don’t want to and get angry if I raise my voice because it is “causing a scene”. So I have just put up with it and gone along with what they want as it feels like the easiest option when you are hopeless and then am made to feel awful after because the same boy who begged me to do something with him then goes around calling me a slag.",,
"My boyfriend told me that his friends made a joke about low rape conviction rates being the 'gift that keeps on giving' when playing Cards Against Humanity. We were 16. It makes me sick to think about because even though he said it was 'just a joke', at least one of the boys involved has gone on to be a serial sexual predator that I am aware of.",,
"When I was in S4 (15) I was getting an award for becoming a prefect, this was pre-covid so there was an assembly with around 200 people. The names were called out on-by-one, when it was my turn I walked down the stairs to collect my award. As I went I heard a pupil from the audience wolf whistle at me. No one said anything. I was mortified. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. It was like I could suddenly feel everyone’s eyes staring at me. My school is quite a big school and pre-covid we all had the same class times which meant that when the bell rang the corridors would be incredibly busy. You were practically shoulder-to-shoulder with someone. It was not uncommon for you to have your bum grabbed or your chest. We pushed it down, cast it off as a ‘joke’ or ‘boys being boys’. We never make a scene. Just carry on with our day. It’s so normalised it’s terrifying. I hope their is change. Future generations need us to speak up. This is our world too. I will not be silenced anymore.",,
I've been sexually and physically abused for years. It all started when I was 7 and I am 15 now. Its always been by my own family members. It's gotten so bad to the point I developed a Eating disorder because of the amount of hatred I held for my body. I started getting self destructive and really wanted to end it all. But I haven't yet and that's all that matters,,
"One of the first times i got properly drunk at a party, i’d just turned 15. someone warned me about a certain boy who was there who’d had sex with a younger girl and to just be generally careful, but he seemed nice enough and we were both drunk. i was the only girl who stayed the night with a few boys, a few who were my best friends who i trusted to keep me safe. he made moves at me throughout the night and i was scared so i told my best friend to make sure nothing happens and to keep me safe. The boy assaulted me twice that night, the first time i told my best friend about it and he brushed it off as us both being too drunk and told me to just avoid him. i fell asleep on a sofa with my best friend in the room and when i woke up the boy was trying to kiss me and assaulted me again. i looked around for my best friend and when i shouted for help he told me it was my fault and wouldn’t help me. it took me months to process what had happened and it was seen as a normal occurrence among private school boys and when i asked my best friend why he didn’t keep me safe he said that i should’ve listened to his first warnings about the boy.",,
i was moving away so my dad let me have a little party for me and my group of friends. we all got a little drunk but awoke to videos of my best friend raping me in front of two others in the room. i’ve never felt more humiliated in my whole entire life,,
"Im not even in sixth form yet and I’ve already experienced boys touching my legs and waist without consent, had a boy tell me he wanted to rape me and have had way too many sexual comments about my body",,
i am 13. there have been various sexual and inappropriate comments made to me and by definition this is sexual harassment.,,
"This first term at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I was raped by a boy in my block after a night out. We had mutual friends and I thought I could trust him as he seemed like a nice, funny guy. He took me too his room after saying there was an afters in there. I could not walk steadily at this point as had a quite a few drinks so he half carried me, which at the time I felt was a nice thing to do and that he was looking out for me. When I got there I realized it was just me and his behavior had changed dramatically. He forced me to undress and had sex with me even though he could see I was very uncomfortable and upset. I did not tell anyone as I was terrified it would come back on me for being an attention-seeker or difficult. I still see him around sometimes and it triggers huge anxiety in me, I’m sure he has no idea of the damage he’s caused.",,
"I was fifteen and intoxicated for the first time with my boyfriend. He wanted to have sex and I initially said I didn’t want to, but he pleaded and guilt tripped me, and I eventually became too worried to say no in case it upset him. I know he could tell I was uncomfortable because I had my first ever panic attack whilst it was happening and asked when he would stop. I still don’t know what to label what happened to me but I’ve never been able to shake off the horror I felt in that moment.",,
"We were sitting in a science lesson. One of the boys in my class came over to me moaning that he’d lost 20 quid because of me. He’d bet another boy that the second boy wouldn’t lose his virginity before his 16th birthday. I was the girl he lost his virginity to, a few weeks before his 16th birthday.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by a friend in my second year. The friends I did talk to about it just told me it was a misunderstanding. I stopped talking to anyone about it, because none of them seemed to care.",,
Lads repeatedly hit girls arses and don’t get anything done to them and catcall the girls all the time,,
"Three incidents, all from the same school. I will not include sexual violence inflicted on me by elders and people outside of school.,1. Year 8. boy I'd never spoken to grabbed my ass while people were moving around for a science practical. I hit him, and I don't think we ever spoke after that either.,2. Year 9: boy started running his hand up my leg and thigh during R.E. The teacher was speaking at the time and I didn't really know what to do - they never teach you what to do. I stayed quiet and we pretended it never happened.,3. Year 10: girl grabbed my ass and boobs on different occasions throughout the day while we went on a day out together. She was my best friend and knew I had a boyfriend at the time. I had told her ""what the fuck, stop"" but it didn't make much of a difference. It didn't change our friendship, and we never talked about it afterwards, but I wish now that I had ended it there.,Children need to be taught to speak out, that they are worthy of respect, and that they do not have a right over other people's bodies, nor do others have a right over theirs.",,
"I was in an incredibly emotionally abusive relationship for a number of years following leaving school, and while it stayed on an emotional level for the majority of the time there was one occasion of rape that until years later I didn’t think even counted since we were in a relationship. He was very into the idea of anal and I had tried it a couple times before with him and it had been so painful , but he kept going with wanting to try and even saying that I enjoyed it because I moaned at one point, disregarding the pain I said I was in. There was one time after a particularly rough period of him being angry and abusive that he brought it up again and I went along with it to try to ‘make things better’ (a futile endeavour), but when it was excruciating instead of stopping, the previous times when I had said it was painful and I didn’t like it, I just put my head down in the pillow in front of me and cried until he finished.",,
"i was 15 and dangerously drunk at a house party. Next thing i knew, this boy (who was completely sober) had taken me to bed with him. I can’t exactly remember what went on, but he forced himself on me after i became unconscious. i just remember opening my eyes every once in a while to see his naked body on top of me, but i was too drunk to move or even stay awake. I was then found by my friend who threw this boy out of the room. The boy continued to bully me at school, he told me it wasn’t true and laughed about it with his friends while i was right there. Sexual assault is not funny. I became suicidal, depressed and suffered from frequent panic attacks. I had no one to talk to because no one understood what i went through. YOU ARE NOT ALONE",,
"There was a particularly depraved senior teacher at my rural primary school. He would trump up some minor misbehaviour and punish us girls - only the girls - by making us pull up our skirts and bend over so he could see our navy knickers. He would pretend to spank us, but was in fact masturbating. Not that we knew what he was doing as we were 6 to 8 years old. He was careful to make sure he only did this with the youngest girls, and completely unobserved with each of his victims when he carried out his nasty abuse. This was 55 years ago (when corporal punishment was commonplace in schools) and I can remember his panting and red sweaty face as if it was yesterday. He'll be long dead now, but have always wondered if the other teachers knew what he was doing.",,
"When I was 15/16 I dated a boy from an all boys school that wasn’t in my area, I thought it was all perfect until he started to tell me that he was being bullied because I wouldn’t have sex with him, he would constantly harass/threaten me and my friends to perform sexual acts for him. He sexually assaulted me numerous times. I had no idea that he was sending messages to my friends and I am full of regret that they felt like they couldn’t tell me. He would touch me/say wildly inappropriate things about me in front of his friends and seemed to do it more if I said no or got upset. It took me a long time to realise that I had been sexually abused, I didn’t realise your first boyfriend could do something like that.",,
between getting sent unwanted nudes or just casually groped i dont even know where to start. feels like sexual assaults have just been part of my life since before i even understood my own body. something i have never shared with anyone is that a family member touched me sexually when i was about 10 but i was too young to know what it was. i just knew i didnt like the feeling and so i erased it from my memory. couple years later i remembered it again when i was a teenager and i knew how bad it was and it made me feel gross but the person and i have both grown up now so its feels too late to say anything. have to see him at every family celebration. haunts me every time i remember what happened,,
"""I was sexually assaulted twice in one night at the age of 14. My friend and I attended a Halloween party that ended abruptly so we were left on the street waiting to get picked up by my friends dad. No one else was on the street until a group of boys came up to us. We had small talk with them as one of them, a [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boy, came in between my friend and I and put his arms around us. He started squeezing my ass and put his hand up my dress and under my underwear. His friends ignored it and acted completely normal. I didn’t know what to do so my friend and I just crossed the road. She told me he had done the same to her and we were both scared.,They found us again and he did the same. Lifting both of our dresses and unconsentually touching us. We left for the second time, still waiting to get picked up. He found us again and as I was sitting on the floor he moved his hips towards my face like I was giving him a bj. His friends laughed as I moved my face away in disgust and we had to call an Uber. ,""I was 18 and got a taxi with my friend and a group of people from college. When we were in the taxi home they persuaded us to go to one of the guys houses. They said I could sleep on the sofa. I went because I thought it would be fun and I didn’t want to leave my friend alone. I liked one of the guys and had joked about sleeping with in the past (I now know that isn’t relevant to what happened). We’d been kissing that night but I was shattered and didn’t want to take it any further. There were lots of us there so I fell asleep of the sofa. He woke me up and said I could get into the bed, I went because I was cold and it meant I’d get a duvet. He came on to me and I said no. I was tired and on my period. He kept begging and then he got annoyed. It was boring that I didn’t want to sleep with him so he just did it anyway. I remember the weight of him on me and feeling like my body was powerless. then I just black out, I don’t think my brain can process what happened next. I didn’t tell anyone for two years because I knew people wouldn’t believe me. He’s a nice guy after all and we were friends. And I had said I wanted to sleep with him. But not that night. I didn’t want to sleep with him and he knows that. I’ve only told a few people.",,
"I’ve been raped twice, my ex boyfriend was very emotionally abusive and when I was going through a particularly triggering time, he made me feel guilty that I wasn’t able to have sex. Would say things like “things don’t feel like the way they were with us” and make me feel so bad. He also then went on to slut shame me for the amount of boys I’d slept with before him, and seeing how traumatic talking about sex was, he let me have panic attacks infront of him while he kept shaming me for my experiences. He made my trauma so much worse - this is the culture that oppresses women",,
"I was going out with this guy. He used to take photos of me without asking my permission and I wouldn't realise that he had taken these photos unless I saw over his shoulder or he mentioned it in passing. He often flaunted these photos of me in either my underwear or naked to his friends without my permission, often whilst I was there so I would watch them all comment on my body. He even showed a picture of me to his dad. This is disgusting. He used to judge my body limb by limb telling me I was 'too skinny' or my 'ass was too flat' insinuating I should excersise more. But he would expect to sleep with me at the drop of the hat. Every other man that so much as glanced in my direction he would accuse me of flirting or claim he was 'uncomfortable because other men were looking at me'. I was guilt tripped into no longer going on nights out with my sports club because there were too many men who could possibly come near me. Every single achievement I gained was shut down and belittled, I was told I was stupid multiple times, I was told I wasn't talented and my sports archivements and artwork were only recognised because 'I went to private school'. He isolated me, insulted my friends daily. He spoke about my family and my friends families in the most vulgar way. And every time I tried to escape or he saw an ounce of happiness he emotionally manipulated me into keeping me around, turning on the crocodile tears and claiming he had ""no one else to talk to"".",,
"I was on a second date with a guy I met on Tinder, while I was at university. For the second date he suggested I go to his and we can order pizza and watch a film, i tried to convince him to go for drinks anyway but he insisted ""nothing would happen"". We ordered pizza and put a film on and started kissing, consensually. He then put his hand down my skirt and tights, I let him but said i was not having sex with him. He said that's fine. And we kept going and then he pulled me upstairs to his room. I kept telling him i didn't want to have sex and that we weren't going to. He kept touching me, and then said ""we will keep going until one of us finishes"", we ended up having sex, even though he knew i didn't want to and i told him multiple times. I did consent to it at the time, but not because i wanted to, but because i wanted to leave, and i knew if i just had sex with him it would be over, and i could leave. It was the pressure that i felt i had to had sex. I just wanted to leave, and the only way i thought i could was by having sex.",,
"Last year I was raped by a close friend, he was the first person I came out to as gay and used it to taunt me for months. He was the only person who didn't treat me differently and now I am completely alone. My school has refused to intervene in the homophobic abuse, it is completely normalised. There is no support.",,
"I don’t want to get into details because I still attend the school, but I have had multiple encounters with [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys where I have experienced sexual assault to varying degrees. Whether it’s making casual remarks about the way I look in my gym clothes, using “blue-balls” and other forms of guilt tripping to coerce me into performing a sexual act, boys taking advantage of me when I was drunk, or, on one occasion, a boy forcing me to have sex with him despite me saying no multiple times. each event has been damaging and I have heard so many other similar experiences from girls regarding [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys.",,
"A boy in my friendship group repeatedly asked me out over a couple of years. At a small party I got far too drunk and he put me to bed. I woke up a few hours later without my top and with pain in my pelvis. I’m not entirely sure what happened but my friends seemed happy the next morning that I finally gave him a chance and saw it as exciting rather than horrifying. I don’t talk to anyone from that group anymore and I still get asked why. I never once considered telling my school, after going to a counseling session over my anxiety when I opened up about my home life they phoned up my parents and told them everything apparently for my safety, nothing changed except I was forced to stop counseling and I never trusted them after that. Besides sexual harassment was ongoing. As young as year 8 I was constantly teased over having large breasts and was told I caused a guys first erection among other things. This was in form time. Growing up in London I never realised this was abnormal. I graduated a good few years ago and have a job now but from stories and younger siblings nothing has changed. Highgate needs to get a control of both their rape and drug culture as well as their toxic pastoral care desperately- I would never recommend any child go there.",,
"So he was my best friend for the last year of high school and my only friend in college. I was suffering with a few problems at the time, so he suggested we go out. It was just the two of us at the pub we both had some drinks and then I went to the toilet, whilst I was in the toilet that’s when my drink was spiked. We went on a walk towards the train station, which was a considerably long walk. The whole way he kept touching me and stroking my leg, he propped me up on a wall and he raped me whilst I drifted in and out of consciousness. It took me a few days to piece together what had happened, but when I did my whole world collapsed and I felt so alone, seeing him around college and no longer having a friend I could turn to. He really almost ruined my life.",,
"Growing up I didn’t have my actual family, they were all mostly in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. When my dad got deported that was when it all started. I was only four and the oldest was three years older than me the youngest was two years older than me. Either way they were the guys I had grown up to know as “my cousins” when I was little I didn’t think much into it I thought it was just something that you did while play a game and like I didn’t really think about it, they never did apologize or see it as s/a they would just tell me that we were all just kids. I agreed with them saying that but now I’ve realized that I was still just a baby.",,
a Few boys was inappropriately touching my boobs and saying very inappropriate things to me,,
"I joined [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when they took girls in sixth form and the rape culture and misogyny there made it a horrible experience for the two years. I had joined the school to try and get away from what had happened to me before: I was raped when I was 15 and wanted to leave the friendship circle that my rapist was in, so I didn't have to see him around or hear my friends (who were his friends) talk about him. It honestly could not have been a worse decision. The boys there treated girls like property, saying they had 'shotgunned' a girl so no one else could try to sleep with her, with no consideration for what the girl wanted at all. One of the boys there fingered a girl while she was passed out drunk , and everyone knew it had happened but just accepted it and didn't care. He was popular and no one ever called him out for sexual assault, and whenever someone did mention his behaviour was horrible the other boys would either make jokes about it or just try and excuse him by saying his parents just got a divorce. His name on their group chat was 'ruthless ravenous rapist' because he always targeted very drunk/ passed out girls and his friends thought it was hilarious. One night after a party we had all slept in a living room, and after falling asleep alone on the sofa, I woke up in the morning to find that same boys hands in my bra and in my pants, touching me while I slept and rubbing his boner into my back. I pretended I was waking up and he moved, and then I ran out and went home. I was so scared to think what would have happened if I hadn't woken up and left. I was too scared to tell people because they all thought it was just some big joke, and when I told my boyfriend at the time he said 'well thats just what he's like'. Another boy in the year above stole my phone and told me he had my nudes and he would send them round (even though there were none) and that he wouldn't give it back unless I went to his house alone. He only stopped when I started to cry and another boy told him to give it back. He also ripped my top off at a party, and grabbed me by the neck, forced vodka into my mouth and told me there would be 'trouble' if I hadn't got with him by the time he'd left the school. After I had rejected him multiple times and told him to fuck off, he became very angry and used to call me ugly and fat and disgusting in front of everyone on the school coach. The experience at that school made me feel so worthless and disgusting, to the point where I considered suicide.",,
"I’m a very curvy person and I would get followed by other students who would touch me and it was caught in camera a couple of times, but never addressed by anyone.",,
"I was in Year 9 so I was about 13, me and my boyfriend went to school together and were in the same year group. He told me to follow him, but I didn’t know where we were going. We went to the 3rd floor of the school which was a dead end and didn’t go up to the 4th floor. I asked what we were doing up here when he pulled me into the corner and started to squeeze my boobs. I instantly felt uncomfortable but didn’t have the courage to say no. He began to kiss me and I felt awful. He began to untuck my shirt from my skirt and tried to finger me. Luckily for me I was on my period so he didn’t go any further. He finally stopped and I felt used and dirty. Like he’d used me for satisfaction and that he never loved me. I later found out that he was a registered sex offender! He said he didn’t want to be with me anymore and he wanted to be friends with benefits!",,
I was in 5th grade. 5th grade. He touched my butt and said he wanted to do nasty things to me. followed me around school and said he would rape me. he was one year older.,,
"It was the last year of high school and because I got good results in S5 I was planning to spend the last year relaxing and enjoying myself. That meant parties. Lots of parties. I had parties most weekends and was drinking a lot because of this. With the number of parties my alcohol tolerance was increasing so I was starting to drink more at the parties. ,Come late September I'm going to a long awaited all nighter at a close friends with a group of about 20, it was gonna be a night to remember. I turn up early with another friend to help get the house setup as the host is working and we want to get everything ready to go. After a bit of prep me and the friend leave to get our drink and when we come back another has turned up early.,The friend who had just arrived was a long term friend from the beginning of high school. We had been in pe and a lot of other classes together throughout school, we were close and got on well. I even helped him with his head boy campaign. He saw us bringing a lot of drink to share between the three of us throughout the night (me, the host and the original helper). ,All was well and when people started turning up we started drinking. Needless to say after about an hour and a half I'm drunk. I'm about 2 litres of cider and half a liter of Jaeger in and well past the point of consent.,Feeling how drunk I am I go to lie down in the parents bedroom because even though they weren't there we were supposed to stay out and so it would be quiet in there. While I'm in there the friend who ran for head boy came in. He lay on top of me and started to kiss me. Never had I said I was gay, never had I even hinted at wanting to engage in anything with this boy but he saw me there, drunk and not in control, and decided, after years of commenting on my body in changing rooms, that he wanted to do something with me.,I was frightened and instead of fight, flight or freeze, my body chose to appease. I never showed intent but I went along with what he wanted out of fear. Even if I had initiated it, he was very slightly tipsy and I was almost blackout, I was in no position to consent.,Skip forward a few hours and I was going up to a room where the few who wanted sleep were lying down to rest. Not wanting to disturb anyone I lie down on the floor next to the door and again he brings himself across and lies on top of me. Due to the layout of the room no one can see us even if they're awake, and he knows this. He starts kissing me again, this time I freeze. I do nothing. I just simply lie there.,He kisses me for what feels like forever before deciding this isn't enough for him. He pulls down my jeans and starts trying to give me a hand job but I'm not hard. He can't do anything with that so instead of deciding to stop he instead takes my hand and puts it on him, moving my hand himself while I lie there unmoving. After he's decided he's had enough fun he rolls off me and goes back to lie in the corner, leaving me lying on the floor unsure of what to do.,A week later at a smaller gathering without him present I break down and a couple friends take me to a room to talk to me, that's the first time i learn about another time that night. While I was blacked he had taken me into a room and had me pressed against a wall kissing me, the girl that walked in didn't realise anything was wrong at the time but it scares me to think what might have happened.,Thankfully when I told the school they kept him off school until things were in place to keep us separate. He was never out with my friend group again and those that knew what happened were very supportive. But I fear I am a rare happy case, it took a lot to speak to someone about what happened, and even afterwards there was nothing I could really do unless I wanted to spend the next 2 years of my life going through a court system trying to get him charged.,Even whilst he was gone there was still people giving me funny looks and spreading rumours about what happened, school was not fun.,A year and a half on I'm recovering and while I may have an occasional dip I've been to counseling and have put the majority of it in my past, I am moving on and better for it.",,
"I was in the sixth grade. They went to my school, and I thought they loved me. They tried to use love as an excuse to do things to me that I wasn’t comfortable with, so I finally gathered up the courage to dump them after 7 months. I told the school about it to prevent it from happening to anyone else. The school put it on their record, but nothing else.",,
"When I got with a boy from this school, he purposefully made sure that everyone around could see it. I wasn’t that fussed at first but then he started trying to pull up my skirt and give me hickeys in front of a whole crowd of people - it really just shows how blurred the line of consent can be. I later understood why he wanted everyone to see what was happening - his friend had filmed the entire thing and posted it to his spam story.",,
i got a text from a class mate to head to the stalls i did when i went there we talked and normal stuff but then things took a dark turn and he made me do somethings,,
"Recently I was in a lesson and a girl in the class jokingly asked the teacher is we could all come to the book, we had just been discussing the plot to his novel, launch to which he replied “yes - if you wear a bikini (paused ..) and heels”. It also worth noting that this particular teacher has commented on the attractiveness of the female pupils before. The whole experience made me sick to my stomach - it was made worse by the fact he is supposed to be a teacher and someone we could turn to.",,
"27 years a go I went to an overnight camping party without telling my parents, they thought I was staying at a friends. I was 14 years old and had never kissed a boy. The party started to calm down and I really fancied this boy, so I decided to sleep outside in my sleeping bag to be nearer him. The girls were in a tent together, where I probably should have been, but I was curious. Then out of the blue 2 older boys came to the party, they were drunk and had been clubbing and they thought they'd pass by and see what was going on. One of the 17 year old boys threw himself on me in my sleeping bag and kissed me, I was trapped. He then fondled me and I felt violated. He then told me to get out of the sleeping bag and go with him. He said he'd seen me around school and thought I was fit. I was very scared as I thought if I protest this he will make a scene and all my friends were in a tent, the lads were younger so didn't want to speak up. I went with him and he got me to lie down and rubbed himself all over me. We walked back up to the tent and he asked me to get in a tent with him, they had removed the lads sleeping in there. I didn't want to get in so I stayed crouched near the tent, feeling scared and afraid. He grabbed my arm several times to get me to go in with him. After many attempts I went into the tent as I was afraid he would make a scene. He then lay me down and raped me, I was a lot of pain and felt that I wasn't in my own body. He did this whilst his friend looked on. I left the tent and walked home, I felt so alone, my parents grounded me as they knew I'd been out at a party and I was bullied at school as rumours started to spread that I was easy. It affected my confidence for the rest of my life and I have been in and out of counselling. I didn't tell any family until I was 22. I did manage to do well in my career and have a family but I never reported it as I always thought I would be blamed for being out and encouraging it when I was a very scared, niave 14 year old young girl.",,
"I was around 8, my bus driver showed his d1ck on me.",,
"I got into a relationship at 13 and it lasted on and off for two years. The boy was a year older and I thought he was everything. Slowly after a few weeks, he began to broker aggressive. He would hit me and blackmail me, telling me it was my fault and I deserved it. He took it a step further and almost every day he’d find away to rape me after school, and managed to do so without suspicious because he got me home in enough time for my parents to not question where I was. This happened for two years. Only just recently have I gotten out of this relationship. But he still bothers me all the time and I’m constantly worried what he will do to me.",,

"I was at a party hosted by a close friend, it was very crowded and I got separated from my friends. I was very drunk and everyone was dancing and I remember realising that a boy I did not know and had not even seen his face to recognise him was holding me against his dick as I was dancing. There was a girl in front of me and I grabbed her arm and told her that I didn't know the guy behind me and could she help me out because I felt really uncomfortable. to my shock and horror she replied no! you're fine that's my friend ben! and she stood directly in front of me blocking my ability to leave. I was so relieved when I had seen her in front of me, believing 100% that she, a girl, would sympathise and save me from the unknown groper behind me. I did not doubt for a second that she would swoop in a pull me away like I would for any girl that came to me saying what I had said to her. it hurt me more that she had knowingly let it happen, almost forced it to happen then the fact that I was groped. I don't remember what she looked like and I didn't even get the chance to see his.",,
when i was in sixth grade a couple of boys came up to me and all grabbed my butt,,
I was in bed with a guy and told me I didn't want to have sex. He responded with you are lucky that I am a nice guy otherwise I'd stick it in you and make you have it. This guy knew I had previously been raped,,
I was sexually assaulted when I was 11 and I didn’t even realise at the time.,,
"This happens every time I go out and now I am scared to even look at the bit responsible, but it started as harmless hugs then he began to constantly ask for them every couple of seconds and I realised he would follow me every whwre I went , he then began touching me without my permisson and asking me for a kiss after me continusly saying no , yet her still tried and asked , he then began touching me in-appropriately in which I didn’t ask for and moved his hands several times , for the rest of that night I would try to avoid him yet he always seemed to be there,, the worst part was that people seen it happening and sat and watched and his friends all seen I was uncomfortable yet they told me to stop being dramatic and say how “he’s a good lad what you on about” , later that night he would beg me to send nude images of myself in which at some point I felt peer pressured into doing (I stayed strong and didn’t give in). He goes to my school and is in my lessons and I have to sit and see him everyday knowing the type of perosn he is and how he makes me feel, several boys in my school act this way as they all beleive it is okay.",,
I was only five when it happened. He was my nanny. My parents would leave me with him as they went to work and thought he was a reliable nanny. I don’t remember much but I remember him making me touch parts of him that I did not want to and I would cry but he would hit me if I didn’t. He would make me get undressed in front of him. My mum then walked in on him trying to do things with me and she fired him and reported him to the police. It still haunts me and I’ve never gotten over it.,,
"I was speaking to a boy in my school for a good couple of months in the summer holidays, and when we returned to school - I seen him at break and he forced me to go into the storage cupboard with him and he raped me. I repeatedly told him “No, please stop it hurts” and he said “It’s normal” and he became more aggressive every time. I didn’t realise this was rape until I came out about it.",,
"My first boyfriend and i weren’t together long but he convinced me that it would be a good idea to lose our virginity to eachother. i gave consent at the time but now i have realised that he coerced me to agree, i wouldn’t have said yes if he made me feel like i had any other option. While having sex he asked me to try things that was too advanced for my first time and begged me to do them i was clearly uncomfortable and asked him to stop and he didn’t. after, he told many people about it , objectifying and fat shaming me. i later found out that he lied and wasn’t a virgin. he stole the experience from me and coerced me into a situation and things i didn’t want.",,
"I dont know exactly how old i was but i was no older than 11, i was molested by my older brother who is 4 years older than me i think. I used to sleep in my brothers room quite often because of fear on nights (this was when we were both young) so nothing would of been expected of it, one day we were i was “asleep” in his bed and my mum came upstairs for the toilet but she entered his room to check on us to only see what was happening my brother had his penis out and had pulled my pants down. This has happened a fee times before and on each occasion i would pretend to be asleep and would never speak up about it i still feel embarrassed to this day. He would never really put his penis inside of me he would just place it against me and rub against me. When my mum walked in and could see what was happening she instantly shouted at my brother and shouted my dad upstairs. I felt so much relief and “woke up” while starting to cry. I was still young i don’t really know what happened next but as result of this my brother got put in care and has never lived with us again. He is still my brother and still my mums son so therefore there still is some communication as i am now 16 and he is 20.Its been so long since and luckily it doesn’t effect me mentally but i think its so unfortunate and upsetting that other people have gone through this and no one knows. (Sorry if this was long)",,
"I went to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] Pride with my friends, met up with my exboyfriend to go home after and fell asleep on his sofa only to wake up with him inside me, too fucked up to care that I wasn’t even awake",,
"When I was 12 I was walking home from the youth club with my friends. I had a boyfriend at the time who I wasn’t with. I was with a group of people some of which I barely knew. Everyone went home leaving me and this other guy who lived the closest to me, he was 2 years above me in school. As we started walking alone he didn’t say a word. Until we got to this point on the street. He said come over here so I did and he started kissing me I tried to tell him to stop but he just pulled me in closer. He started fingering me so hard that it hurt I didn’t know what to do or say I’d never been in that situation. When I got home I was bleeding and I felt so guilty for being too scared to push him off. I had to tell my boyfriend. So I did and he told everyone. I got branded as a slag. This lead to boys thinking I was easy. And some of them were making bets on who could sleep with me first.",,
"I was raped by this boy in 2015. He forced himself in me despite me repeatedly saying no and completely denied it afterwards when confronted. He told me I’ve caused him trauma by telling his friends etc. He told ME I caused HIM trauma. This boy raped me when I was a virgin, he felt entitled to my body and took it. He never faced consequences due to the fact I was told if I took it to court his rich musician father would hire a great lawyer and I’d be made to be a liar. He ruined my sexuality and my childhood. And he got away with it",,
"I was approached by a Male flasher, same man on my walk 3 times in a week, after the 3rd time I reported to police, I managed to take his photo and the details and photo of his car, my main reason for reporting was the walk way was used by school children also, I was told by the police that I emailed all this to that they were unable to trace him!!! I found this unbelievable, and no more was said, I'd think twice about reporting again",,
"During a summer holiday from uni (around 2000/2001), I worked at the local council as a temp. During the following summer, I again worked with the same team, with the same boss. He'd been perfectly normal throughout the two summers of work but for some reason we ended up going to lunch at the end of my second stint with the team. It was all perfectly amicable and friendly until it came time to say goodbye when he forcibly kissed me on the lips. I did nothing, said nothing, just turned and left. And ended up questioning what I’d done to give this married, father of two the wrong idea. In hindsight, nothing. I did nothing to encourage his unwanted attention, other than accept an invite to lunch from my boss.",,
"So I’ve been sexually assaulted probably 5/6 times, mostly by [school names omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys. I don’t want to go into detail but the worst time I can remember is waking up after blacking out due to the pain of a boy fingering me. Another time was a random boy in the street doing the same, and my “guy friends” at the time acting as bystanders. I felt so humiliated and stupid to have let a friend and boy I trusted do this to me (neither was from [school names omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but I have expert similar behaviour from boys from both schools). It has genuinely had such a massive impact on me from the age of 14+ to be sexualised into being sluts/not. I was slut shamed for acts I was sexually assaulted for. It had honestly complexly changed the relationship I’ve had with boys since and has honestly transformed my relationship with boys leaving the [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] school bubble, and the worst thing is it had happened to me since. We had a founders day at my school and it was nearly cancelled due to the behaviour/assault of the boys in the year above and this behaviour was certainly replayed in my year at school.",,
"i wasnt going to send this in because id sort of gotten over it/ didnt think it was “extreme” enough, but after seeing all the similar stories about [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] i feel i should share.,i also had an experience with getting intimate photos shown around the boys my year at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] after sending an intimate photo of me to my then boyfriend. i was 13 i think & it was on summer holiday, & he was persistently messaging me asking me to send him a photo of myself, telling me it would show him how i truly felt about him & promising that nobody would find out. a few months later, i remember sitting at home & suddenly getting messages from boys in my year saying “slag” “your photos are ugly”, and then the next day in school the boys were shouting “slut” in the corridor. it was horrible- i felt like the worst person in the world & was so ashamed. my boyfriend said it wasnt a big deal & that it didnt matter, but i remember crying for days & feeling like it was the end of the world",,
"I was at an after party and I was really really drunk that I’d pulled myself away from the party and sat on some stairs. This guy who’s party it was came and sat next to me, I had talked to him before. He knew I was 18, at the time I didn’t know he was 28. He asked for me to have sex with him repeatedly and I did say no because I wasn’t feeling great. But he kept asking and me being in the state I was just gave up and agreed. I barely remember what happened and the only part of sex I remember was when my friend walked in. I never thought it was that bad of a thing to happen but the more I thought about it the more I felt gross about the whole situation. Especially when I find out he’s been like this with other girls. Also I have had the typical hand up dress at a club and one guy put his hands down my trousers and I had to actually force his hand out. Both of these guys were behind me without me even knowing.",,
"I was raped by my boyfriend when I was 20. I had gone out and came back to my flat black out drunk. I passed out as soon as I got home as I was so tired and unable to walk properly (I’d literally been propped up all the way home). My boyfriend decided he would rape me because he wanted to. The next day he told me I was ‘so loud’, I know that was me telling him to stop. He even took a picture of my face afterwards to show me the next day, I was not awake, I was not even conscious it looked like. I didn’t say anything when he told me we had had sex, but it made me uncomfortable for months, in fact years, I would think back on it regularly and it made me feel ill. It wasn’t until the last month I was able to come to terms with the fact I was raped. By someone I trusted.",,
"When i was 13-14 (i’m 15 now) i was in a drama lesson in school and me and my group where working on a group project. I was facing towards my group and a boy from group went behind me when grabbed my ass, and when i turned around he looked at me and smiled. soon at break i was with my friends and none of them knew what happened but my assaulter was there. For about 5 months i never told my friends what happened because i was scared and only recently told them who the person was. I still to this day cry about the incident and hate my body for it, but i know one day i will be okay.",,
"I was sexually assaulted in my chemistry class for about 1 and a half months. It was the boy beside me. At first I thought nothing of it because we were rlly close beside each other so I made excuses for him like ‘hmm maybe it’s because I’m beside him and we are rlly close so he can’t help it if he touches me’ or ‘hmm maybe he actually is dropping his pen that many times during class’ Whenever we are watching the teaching explain something to the class we have to turn around kind of, in order to be facing opposite to him. Whenever we did this I noticed this boy’s knees always touching my bum and pressing up against it. Any normal person would stop doing it as it would be uncomfortable for them, as their knees are literally on someone’s bum. I know I would anyways. Like in assembly for example in those tiktoks where your knees touch the others persons and u instantly move it as ur uncomfortable. It was this but his knees on my bum. It would stay like this until the teacher was done talking and I turned around. I would shift forward a bit and he would stop for a bit only to do it again in a few mins. Then it was him ‘dropping’ his pen and it always landed in front of my stool (chair) .instead of him kicking it out with his foot like any normal person, he would put his head down all the way so it was right at my crotch or thighs. He ALWAYS dropped his pen and ALWAYS done this. One day when we were marking our exam, he went up to the teacher to try and get extra marks for something he thought he should’ve gotten the mark for. In my head I was like ‘please don’t brush past me on ur way back to ur chair’ THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR HIM NOT TO. But he did. All of this happened on the same day. But the one dropping and touching me lasted every period, if not most for a good month and a half. On the last lesson I said “stop touching me” and the teacher heard and whom he replied with, “ don’t annoy ******!”. The boy said, “I’m not touching her” and the teacher kept saying for him to not annoy me. During that class I was extra uncomfortable. I never realised that it was sexual assault until that lesson. I still don’t know if I’m over exaggerating. I still don’t know if I’m making excuses. I don’t know. What I do know is that this has caused me some form of trauma. I am scared of this boy and he makes me feel so disgusted and angry. I am ashamed to say that this happened to me. I haven’t told anyone apart from my boyfriend and close friends. My boyfriend is the only one that understands how serious it is and how big of an impact it had on me. I can’t listen to certain songs now because they remind me of it….”I hate you for what you did” (tiktok song) One day I was at the gym and I had to stop because that song started playing in my playlist as I forgot to remove it and it got to overwhelming that I had to look out the window and try to distract myself. I hate how this is how women are treated nowadays. I’m not saying it’s all men but it’s certainly all women. And for those who may ask, “what were you wearing?” It was my uniform. What makes me so angry is that I used to be this boy’s friend. Not at the time but the year before. Here’s my story since the only person I can tell is my boyfriend and I want to share my story with others anonymously. If you relate to anything then you’re not alone. 💖💖💖",,
"I have not experienced very many men. I started an on-again/off-again relationship with my partner four years ago. We had been friends for MANY years and had hooked up once or twice ten years prior. As a survivor of childhood trauma, I find what happened to be especially triggering to me and others when I share my experience. I flew across the county to visit him during a particularly hard part of his life. He and I had consensual intercourse, however during this incident, he began choking me. I was taken back and thought, “How odd… but okay… whatever…” and later learned he’d been a porn addict (amongst many other addictions) for years. I tried to talk to him about how it made me feel and he insinuated that he could not orgasm without choking me. I have endured it every time since and am relieved to see that it’s not just me who thinks it isn’t alright. I was afraid to tell my mother what he did to me and felt lower self worth as a result of this physical abuse. Once it was presented to me this way, I realize my entire relationship is based on verbal AND physical abuse. I would never wish how I feel on anyone.",,
"A group of us went back to a friend’s house after a night out. I was very drunk & semi-unconscious in my friend’s bed with a guy friend on either side of me. Our group was just hanging out. Both guys started touching me without my consent. My boobs, vagina. All over. I couldn’t move to push them away. They only stopped because they realised the other was doing the same. They laughed when they realised. That laughter has haunted me since. Made me blame myself, hate myself, hate myself even more for hating myself. And the vulnerability and self-loathing I felt in those moments has transformed into a furious anger I don’t know how control. It’s made me hate sex.",,
"I’ve had 3 run ins with my school with sexual assault and harassment and our deputy head is defending them all even with evidence and proof of it all. One of the first times this happened nobody called the police they took all the information on what happened and blackmailed me and my mum into not saying a word to anyone. A teacher touched me inappropriately and even with past experiences a lot worse then this the school didn’t take it seriously and they called me and many witnesses a liar. However this time it was another student and I wasn’t the only victim, this boy has been begging and threatening us all for ‘pictures’ and after months of collecting screenshots and proof of it the school still allow him to walk around with any punishment. One of the victims is around 12 and there are around 50 other girls all of different ages and schools and chellaston academy has not called the police or gotten any legal workers involved. Although this could have been a lot worse it is a bad situation and very uncomfortable for us all to walk around knowing people like him are getting away with it and could possible get worse and do something physical. I have read up on ofsted and how schools are ‘normalising’ this kind of behaviour and it is disgusting.",,
"i was around 14 when my boyfriend had kissed me. i didn’t think to much of it but, he kept pressuring me and the teacher walked by and just stared and made jokes.",,
"I remember in one of my classes a year ago, where I was the only girl in a class full of boys who would very often make sexual jokes towards me in front of my face to the whole class, ask me if I could set them head as a joke all the time, constantly ask me about my sexual history like it was any of their buissness. There was also one boy in that class who would always come up to me and hug me from behind and come and sit on my chair so I could feel his dick on me, he thought that because every girl was submissive to him he could just come up and do whatever he wants to you. This boy is also known to sexually assault other girls. These constant jokes were made in front of the whole class and even the teacher would laugh along with these boys as it was just the class “humour”. I was so uncomfortable in that class and felt so alone as the only girl, also given the fact that I felt like no one was looking out for me as the teacher didn’t care.",,
"I was friends with this guy who was always making sexaul jokes about me, but I just laughed it off and always replied saying I would never do that with him. and then one day we where both at my best friends house just us three and he grabbed my boobs from behind and said hah there's nothing there. Then five minutes later I was sat in this big chair and he was messing around sitting on me and stoking my legs while I repeatedly asked him to stop and punched him a little but I'm very weak so it did nothing which my friend got on camera, and then he got off me but wouldn't get me out the chair and tried to finger me but luckily my friend shoved him off so that he had only touched it but not gone too far. I was so shocked I didn't know how to react so I just pushed it to the back off my mind and tried to forget about it. So then for the next year we stayed friends and i had to sit next to him in maths everyday with him always making those jokes and sometimes stroking my leg which I didn't like but just ignored. But with everyone speaking out about their about their experiences i couldn't stop thinking about it and it really got to me and made me so angry so I started avoiding him but we are in most classes together so it was hard. My other friends knew about it the whole time but didn't make a big deal about it because he does it alot to lots of girls. So I told them how it was affecting me and most of them were very supportive but a few of my guy friends who are also friends with him kept just telling me to move on and get over it, but I can't until I know he will stop doing it to others aswell so I took him aside at break and tried to tell him my side and what he had done but he denied it all and said he did absolutely nothing wrong and that I was a horrible person because I had gone around telling everyone that he had raped me which I never did and he doesn't see how wrong it is. So my friend showed him this website and he said it made him less sympathetic because he thought most of us were lying and now I am just stuck knowing that he will never change and everytime I go to my best friends house I see where it happened and get reminded.",,
"There was this one teacher who taught chemistry at this school and she used to just pick on me or punish me for things I hadn’t done and was kind/normal with everyone else. I was extremely shy and nervous as I was new at the school and didn’t have much confidence. I was also experiencing bullying not long after this - it seemed that these two boys saw it as easy as it was quite clear to my class that this teacher seemed to not like me. These boys were loud and would try to aggravate people and they would make sexual comments all the time or show pictures of porn on their phone during the chemistry class. These boys used to grab my butt and when I was trying to sit down they would try and quickly lift my skirt. They used to make comments about the category of porn I should be in and would also tell me to shut up if I tried to complain. They used to also mix this alongside picking on me about my hair and making fun of me trying to say that I’m poor and stuff like that. This teacher would allow them to do all of these things. And then months down the line this teacher decided that she wanted to create a seating plan and she put everyone else on a couple of tables and then made one small table only with these boys that were sexually harassing, assaulting and bullying me and with me as the only girl in the middle of them. When I spoke to her about why she had done that as she knows they bully me and she said it’s because she found it entertaining. I still feel a bit upset and let down when I think about the way some teachers at this school were allowed to act there was so much unprofessional behaviour by teachers that this just seemed like it was allowed and that teachers could do what they want because they think it’s fun or funny. Even allowing a child to be bullied and sexually assaulted and watching it for months. And weirdly enough, these boys were never told off or told to stop at all. There were too many incidents especially from the science block of teachers, there needs to be culture change at this school and teachers need to stop perpetuating bullying or sexual abuse and rape culture as at least from my experience at this school the teachers made things worse especially for girls that were shy or timid or lacked confidence in themselves to do anything about it.",,
"we dated when it happened, his friends harassed me. should've pressed charges.",,
"Your generation is the latest to be sexually assaulted and abused. I’m 73 and I was sexually abused at approx 7ys old. I wasn’t the only girl either. I found out a long time ago that the same man abused other girls my age. I was also assaulted at approx 12yrs in a more minor way. I thought child abuse was the last great unspoken thing that wasn’t talked about,but in fact,it’s the abuse of females. Men are the problem. It must be them that are punished and not a lifetime of silence for women. It’s got to the stage that we’d have to be stupid to go to the courts and expect justice.until men are convicted of rape and assault,women will continue to be used and abused.",,
"I was 12 years old at school, it was a sunny day and I was walking across the school field with my friend. I was wearing school uniform, except not my blazer because it was hot. A boy shouted at me ""Put your tits away"". Made me feel so uncomfortable/self-conscious",,
"I was 15 and obviously too young to drink, however I was at a house party and went way over my limit, becoming black out drunk. This boy, completely sober, took me upstairs away from the party and undressed me. He took advantage of my very drunk state, even after i had eventually passed out. I just remember opening my eyes every once in a while to see his hands over me, or him forcing me onto him even though i was unconscious. Afterwards, I was only a child and had no idea what had happened, but fell into a series of severe depression, suicidal and anxiety attacks whilst he walked around school laughing at the fact that he had ruined my life and joked with his friends about how he had raped me. I had no support. I was a child. I felt as though my innocence had been stolen and my body violated. I was alone.",,
"He was 17 and I was 13, it was summer so we were drinking a little. we were watching a film and he grabbed me around the waist and then up under my shirt. He wouldn’t let me leave and eventually when I managed to get out of the room I called my friend but they didn’t answer. He followed me to my room and wouldn’t leave me alone, he tried to kiss me and when I turned away he grabbed me around my jaw. I fought back and before anything else could happen he got called downstairs. He then harassed me through my social media and friends for 2 weeks after until I threatened the police repeatedly. I didn’t tell anyone for 3 months. And only realised I had been ?assaulted? When having a conversation about it 6 months later. I still don’t know what to label it.",,
"My daughter had been in an abusive relationship which turned into online stalking after she ended it, this took the form of following her to this college and attempting to get on the same courses despite having shown no interest in the area of study before the break up, spreading lies about my daughter of a sexual nature, setting up multiple social media profiles to stalk and harass her- including vile name calling and abuse. Despite telling the college about the behaviour, furnishing them with screenshots and telling them the names of people who had witnessed the behaviour, the promises of action were not followed through despite my daughter’s mental health deteriorating as the stalking continued despite the boy being warned. The head of safeguarding even told my daughter she was concerned about ruining the boy’s life chances if they excluded him and asked my daughter how she would feel about that and was it what she wanted, she was made to feel that by complaining she was being malicious. She was also told they felt she was exaggerating her distress at the situation as she had been seen laughing with her friends. This was said to her as she was sobbing. No follow up took place and my daughter has been left with no confidence in the structures meant to support her. The safeguarding staff member who dealt with the initial calls when this started avoids eye contact with my daughter in the corridor. We feel that the college has not only failed my daughter but missed an opportunity to intervene in the boy’s life before he escalates. The lesson my daughter has taken is that the initial concern shown was nothing more than lip service and that the college does not care about sexual harassment and the welfare of the students.",,
"i had a old friend and i used to go to her house a ton and her older sister had a boyfriend, [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] he always played with us and he was super nice, him and my friends older sister broke up, a few years later he added me on snap chat and me and him catched up, i was 11 he was 18,he sent me nude photos of him and asked me to do so too i said no but i was so confused and scared.",,
"I was 26 at University, and good friends with another mature student. I went out one night in the first Autumn term and got very drunk. I was walking home when my 'friend' later to become my 'boyfriend' ran after me, saying he'd take me back to my room. We got back to his room and he raped me - I was too drunk to consent. I became pregnant. I was devastated. There was no way I was going to have a baby at the start of my university career when it had taken so much to get there, years of doing dead end jobs to save up, resitting exams and going back to college later in life. We then became a 'couple' - until I started to suffer with depression a year later and he dropped me like a brick. It wasn't until several years later when I was talking to an old university friend that she said to me - you know you were raped. I saw you that night and you were in no fit state to consent. I am not proud of getting so drunk that I couldn't consent but being drunk in your first term at university is not a crime, rape is!",,
"My ex boyfriend touched me on the bus, he came over to my house at 2 in the morning. it was unexpected i was sleeping my mom and dad let him in we had to bring him home. he stalked me and kissed me without consent. i hate him. i wish i had never met him. I cried that day at school in the bathroom and self harmed the rest of the school year. they did nothing to stop him from talking to me. he kept doing it. people didn’t see that i was uncomfortable because i was laughing and smiling… that doesn’t mean i’m not uncomfortable????? WHY DOES NOBODY UNDERSTAND",,
"I was at boarding school. I was 17. I went to the San to get the MAP and also to go on the pill as I had started sleeping with my first boyfriend and the condom had split and I didn't want to get pregnant. The doctor there (nicknamed by the girls as Dr Puke) proceeded to question me extensively as to what had happened as condoms ""don't just split."" He kept on saying ""come on, tell me what really happened."" I kept saying that I had and it had split. After being repeatedly pressured to tell him precisely what had happened step by step, he then told me to go and lie on the bed as he had to examine me before he could put me on the pill. He told me to take my pants off. I did what he said. He then put his fingers inside me and felt around. I felt tense and awkward but I thought it was me not feeling comfortable with being in that position, bottom naked, legs apart, having an internal in front of a doctor. It went on for a while - him pushing this side and that, up and down - probing and feeling all around. He then said, that's ok. You can get up now. And gave me the MAP pill. I felt ill - i remember running off to tell my boyfriend - I felt repulsed. I had to go and have a shower and relax. I later realised that it was quite unnecessary to have been given an internal examination and for him to probe around like that with his fingers. No speculum was used. I still feel sick and tense when I think about it now.",,
"I never really thought about my past experiences and how wrong they were until these powerful women have told their stories and spoke up. I wouldn’t say it was rape but I was unsure of myself when it was happening I said no but he reassured me he knew what he was doing and that I would be fine. Being a girl and In this world is like a battle every moment of everyday, the multiple cat calls I have received and gropping on public transport is disgusting and it needs to change",,
"this happened to me awhile ago but even after coming out abt the trauma 8 years after it happened, i haven’t seemed to get any better. when i was 7 i had a neighbor who was pretty rude and bossy and a couple years older than me, maybe by 2, but i looked up to her bc of her age and i thought i was cool because i hung out with older kids. one day she asked if i knew what a lesbian was, and me being seven i responded with “is that a kind of lizard?” i was obsessed with animals and nature and i didn’t know much about sex and orientation. she laughed at me and said she can show me if we played at my house in my basement the next day. for the next three months i was repeatedly held down to the bed, forced into performing and receiving sexual acts, and threatened if i didn’t want to continue “playing.” she would lock me in the guest bedroom of the basement and say that it was the hotel room after our wedding night , and that it was normal for mommies and daddies to do this. i was clearly distressed about it when it happened, and i tried to make suggestions like “can we only pretend to kiss?” or “can i keep my clothes on?” each time i asked one of those questions she would yell at me, and on occasion hold my shoulders down to the bed so i couldn’t move. she would always use the same threat. “if you don’t _____ i’m going home and telling my mom this was all your idea and we will never be friends again.” after seven years i finally came out about it, and to this day the feelings of self loathing and dirtiness haven’t gone away. idk what else to do.",,
"I was sexually harassed on a regular basis from year 7 onwards, boys would ask me what colour my public hair was, comment on my breasts, call me ugly, repeatedly ask me out in front of their mates to make fun of me. It was a surprising day something wasn’t said, I had to travel to school on the bus with these boys everyday, I was a captive target sitting there. They would throw things in my hair and ask me if I wore makeup. I could hear them sitting in front of me talking about wanking and other sex acts. A female teacher a school told me ‘the boys won’t like you unless you smile’. As I got older it progressed to groping, hands thrust up my skirt and one occasion a a crutch was pushed up. Teachers witnessed much of this behaviour and never once intervened. Their lack of interest condoned the behaviour. I felt alone, ashamed and isolated and had no one to talk to. My academic work was effected, I cried a lot of days, my self esteem and self confidence was crushed, I stopped trying, stopped playing sports. This was all in the 1990’s. What has changed? It insidious in school, on the streets. We need change, school should be safe for girls, at the moment it’s still safe for abusers.",,
"When I was 14 I was groped at a party, when my initial instinct was to slap the perpetrator I was laughed at and made to feel like I was the one who overreacted - I’m still self conscious to this day",,
"Throughout my time in year 11, a boy in year 7 used to follow me around school at break times, coming up to me and touching my bottom. I told him not to but he carried on. He didn’t stop until one day I hit him. He later joined the prison service and the army.",,
Reading the testimonies I couldn’t help but think my school was exactly like this. The boys would share nudes and judge girls solely on looks and how far they would go with a boy. Lots of my friends had their nudes shared and that includes me and this was happening in year 9. Even in year 7 you’d have boys put their hands up your skirts and joke about it. The school never talked about it or mental health and just let it happen even though they knew how the boys acted.,,
"I'd been on a night out, was really drunk and got locked out of my room. Asked one of the guys in the block if I could stay in his room - I thought he was pretty friendly, I'd spoke to him on other nights out and he was very chatty and pleasant. I fell asleep in his bed and woke up to him groping my chest and he had his hands inside my underwear. He was completely sober. I know I could have left and I've felt guilty ever since for not doing more about it at the time but I felt so uncomfortable and I was so drunk I didn't feel in a position to confront him about it.,It was 6 years ago and I still hold on to that guilt and to know someone has touched the most intimate parts of my body whilst I was sleeping, without my consent makes me feel sick.",,
"I was touched multiple times by other students. Mostly on my butt, however i was also touched on my breasts on multiple occasions, I was also touched on my vagina. None of these occurrences were consensual, I felt scared to talk to administrators/ faculty about it because I didn’t want other students to think I was a snitch.",,
"I was drunk. I was the kind of drunk which you don’t remember, and you don’t have any idea what’s going on, and you are unconscious. I don’t know how we got into the room or how anything happened, all I remember is trying to find my pants because he’d left after he’d done it. The next day I thought oh it’s not a big deal, it was just drunk sex. I later found out he hadn’t used a condom and I had a huge pregnancy scare, he didn’t care. I later spoke to my sister about it and she made me realise what had actually happened, I’d been raped. I was terrified, I felt like I couldn’t open up to anyone because they’d think, ‘How has she just now thought this was rape, if it were rape she would’ve said sooner or gone to the police.’ People don’t realise how hard that can be. So i didn’t go to the police as I was ‘scared of ruining his life’ (even though he ruined part of mine.) He had told all his friends that he fucked me but failed to mention that in actuality he had fucked my unconscious body. I found out that about a year later he had raped another girl and I sobbed for her. Maybe if I’d gone to the police or his school I could have stopped her from being his victim as well, but I didn’t. People don’t seem to realise how bad rape culture is in the UK; he still has friends, he still goes to a good school, he still ‘gets girls’, he still has a life, and I’m sick of it.",,
When I was 13 I got drunk for the first time and quickly became very intoxicated. One of my ‘friends’ decided they wanted to meet a group of boys across and dragged me along with her even though I was in no condition to walk. When I got there a certain boy kept on grabbing me and being young and drunk I didn’t know better. He was also older. I asked my ‘friend’ to bring me to the toilet but instead the boy said he would bring me. After peeing he brought me into a bush and tried to finger me and tried to force me to give him head. I do not remember if I did. He then did up his trousers and told me not to tell anyone what happened. I straight away told my friends who were with me but instead of supporting me one dismissed what I said and the other told everyone that I gave head in a bush. It got around everywhere and I had tons of people ask about it and I had no idea what to say. I was dubbed a slut for years after then and even my boyfriend that I got 6 months after the incident would complain about how my reputation affected him. It took me four years to understand the gravity of the situation and what was actually done to me.,,
"At school, i was constantly approached and touched sexually without my consent. boys would come up to me and put their hands up my skirt and grope my breasts. i was conditioned to believe that this was regular behaviour even though it seriously upset me. there were multiple occasions when i was left alone with a boy and he would make me feel uncomfortable and proceed to touch me. sometimes other students would see this and do nothing about it, sometimes they even laughed. i was only 10 or 11 the first time it happened and it continued over 3 years. it really upsets me that girls probably feel like this behaviour is normal because it’s not. boys need to be taught that it’s not okay to just touch girls whenever they feel like it.",,
"I was raped when I was 14. He took my virginity unknowingly, without my consent. To this day I blamed it on myself, but now I realise I couldn’t have done anything to save myself. He used his power over me to coerce and manipulate me into having sex. I never came to terms with what happened to me because I was scared. I have been coerced and raped multiple times in my life without fully realising what was happening to me. I needed help for so long after but I never told anyone what had happened to me",,
so i was walking to my lesson. it was english to be precise. and all of a sudden this boy walks up to me and asks for my number keep in mind at the time i was 12. i of course don’t give it to him and he pulls me into the nonbinary bathrooms and sexuality assaults me. the school didn’t do anything about it,,
"When we got to about year 10/11 boys in the year above would start to take notice of the girls in my year. I remember being at a party and getting with a boy two years older than me, as we were kissing he kept trying to push my shoulders down, I said to him I wasn’t going to do that and even tho he kept continuing to push my shoulders down. He said he couldn’t ‘cum’ otherwise so I felt bad but I didn’t let myself give in no matter how much he tried to push me down to give him head.",,
I was with some friends on a night out nearly passed out on a sofa were told we need to go home and next thing I know is this girl is sat on top of me kissing me while I’m half asleep,,
"There were a few different occasions.,""My family used to visit this campsite in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] every year when i was a child. there was a group of families, three french, one german and one other english, who used to camp with us. when i was seven, the twelve year old son of the english family started to do stuff to me. i didn’t know what he was doing, but he seemed cool and i wanted him to be my friend. i wanted him to like me. touch it. he first said, when we had gone into the woods behind the field. i said no, he told me i should. he told me that it was normal, what “we” were doing. he told me to put it in my mouth. he told me his friend said it was nice and that i needed to do it. he lay down his hoodie for me to lie on the floor of the woods, so that he could have sex with me. he told me to lift my top up (now this is the most vivid memory, as i remember exactly thinking, why does he want me to lift my top up, we are the same). he told me never to tell my parents or anybody about it, it was our secret. he told me that my mum was shit and he hated her, and so so did i, until a few months ago. we would go on walks down, across the rocks by the sea, out of site, and i knew what he wanted me to do. i just wanted him to like me. the last time i visited that campsite, and the last time i saw him and it happened was when i was twelve. i remember him being worried; that i might get pregnant and then somebody would find out. or was that my worry? i can’t remember. i remember having that thought but i don’t know if it was him who planted it there. i just wanted him to like me.",,
"when i was in the 2nd grade, i met a boy who was in 7th. now, being in [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. i was in elementary, he was in middle school. he’s 5 years older than me. growing up, i guess you could say he took advantage of me? he is indeed a pedophile. basically telling me year after year that him flirting, kissing, and going out with me was okay. i will never ever forgive him for practically grooming me on and off for several years. im now in 8th grade, and he has graduated. yet, he has not faced any consequences. though it still haunts me, im doing better.",,
"I had my boyfriend and 4 of his and my close mates around my flat in London. One of the friends he wanted round I had never met (let’s call him X), but everyone vouched for him. We all got high that night and X became extremely touchy. While I was standing in front of my boyfriend (he was on the bed) X came straight up to me and grabbed my boob and tried kissing right in front of my boyfriend. I wasn’t wearing a bra which made this even worse. This behaviour continued the whole night. My boyfriend chose not to say anything because it would make it ‘awkward’, so I just played it off like it wasn’t a big deal. I now realise it was sexual assault, and it happened right in front of the person I thought would keep me the safest.",,
"When on holiday as a 13 year old with my family, we were show around a temple by a guide, as my family left a room he forcibly stopped me from leaving and demanded I kissed him on the cheek. I froze and did so in order for him to let me go, he then proceeded to kiss me continuously and touch me as I called for help. Ultimately, I managed to push him off and run away. He faced no consequences.",,
It makes me sick finding out now while at university how many all girls schools like my own tell the pupils that their skirts a must be a certain length as it would “make the male teachers uncomfortable”. While not having a trouser option AND I would hope the male teachers who work there have the ability to control themselves around UNDERAGE girls. It worries me now that they think they can’t.,,
"I was raped a month after my 16th birthday at a party, locked in a car outside the party house.",,
"It started when I was 12. For them it was funny to walk down the halls and touch me inappropriately. It also happened during class. They would constantly touch my thighs, my butt, and my private areas. Majority of the times we would try to stop them, we would get scolded for being a distraction or disrupting the flow of the class/school. From middle school to high school, the same people would joke about touching others inappropriately. Some have reported these people but they have gotten nothing but a slap on the wrist. Thankfully we’re still remotely learning, because me along with others know they would still continue to act this way if we weren’t. 12 to 14, those two years were filled with so much confusion on whether it was my fault, if it was normal, if it was ok for this to happen. It’s tiring.",,
I was sexually harassed at my school. I told my teachers but they did nothing. Absolutely nothing.,,
"This is more psychological abuse but my first relationship was in Year 8-10 on and off. But throughout this relationship there were times where I wanted to keep it non sexual, or I wasn’t ready to do anything more than kissing. I was only 13. But he would say it was fine but when in the moment during kissing, he’d say to me ‘you’ve got to give me a bj because i hate how you leave me with blue balls.’ Naive as I was, I thought that was the worst thing possible and that what he was saying was what I needed to do. So I was manipulated into doing sexual things for him in case he would get angry at me for leaving him like in that state. In hindsight now in a better relationship, I realise how manipulative he was and how I was used for his own benefit. One time we were making out and he asked me if we could have sex (no condoms and out of the blue), bear in mind i was still 13 and he was nearly 15. Thankfully I persistently said no, but because I said no he went and sought that elsewhere and ended up cheating on me because I wasnt ready for sex. To this day its rewired my mental state and has taken me so long to revert how me saying no will not equate in someone leaving or cheating on me. He would always make me feel as though I was incompetent and wrong and that if i didnt fulfil his needs, that he would just go and find a girl who would. He made me believe that that was normal boy behaviour.",,
It was a few years ago now but suddenly I have started reliving the experience and having flash backs. I was drinking with friends in town we had quite a few drinks. We ended up in a club and I can only say I think my drink was spiked. I got separated from my friends and have sketchy memories. I don't remember leaving the club but have memories of waking up in a park being raped by I man I don't know. I have very sketchy memories of getting home. I rang my boyfriend of the time at midnight crying and making no sense. I don't remember this. I was very ill for a couple of days and was covered in love bites. I have never shared this with anyone including my then boyfriend friends or family. I was totally embarrassed and ashamed by the whole experience. I still cringe years on. I blame myself for drinking too much and putting myself in the situation. I don't know why it is suddenly distressing me so much. I obviously never dealt with the situation.,,
"My all boys' school had a rape culture that was endemic throughout the school and it often felt like teachers condoned it and even encouraged it. Male teachers would tell us 'not to play hockey like women drive' and that women were there to 'make steak and give us blowjobs'. When I was on a school trip when I was 14, I heard two male teachers talk about which female teachers on the trip they'd have sex with in graphic detail and how they'd discussed this with some of the male students on the trip. Female students in the sixth form were told to not wear 'sexually revealing clothes' because it would give younger male students 'the wrong idea' and 'distract them while they were learning'. One science lesson, two boys who sat behind me described in graphic detail how they were going to rape my mum and my sister, I found it so distressing that after everyone left the lesson I stayed in my seat and burst into tears, the male teacher didn't know how to react and after I explained to him what happened, there didn't appear to be any repercussions and no one spoke to me about it again. As a young gay man who wasn't out, I didn't feel like there was any support for me and my experience only made me feel more shame towards my sexuality and gender expression. Sexual assault was so common I would never have even considered what I experienced assault until the last year, or so, when I've started to reflect more on what happened. One male student forced me over a table and started humping me, he was much bigger than me and I was scared he was going to rape me and only stopped when another student told him to. The same male student would often corner me and offer me money to perform sexual favours which I refused. I stopped going to my PE lessons because male students would grope me and harass me. When my sisters were attending the mixed sixth form at the school, the boys forced every girl to walk through a line of chairs in the common room and rated them from 1-10. This all happened in a general culture of misogyny and homophobia, where slurs like 'pussy' 'faggot', 'batty' and 'bender' were just an accepted part of your existence. I know there are some people who struggle to believe that the words and actions I've described translate into bigger things, but they do. My female friends were raped, harassed and assaulted by the same boys who bullied me. I won't go into detail on those instances because those are not my stories to tell. It often felt like the school was complicit in these actions, we never had any assemblies or education about misogyny, assault, harassment, homophobia or other forms of discrimination and I can't believe they were ignorant to the fact that misogyny and homophobia were so widespread. I believe the school's sports culture encouraged this sort of behaviour, the PE department would describe themselves as 'bantanomo bay' and I was made to run a race, which your place in determined your PE set, without any socks on because I had 'the wrong colour socks' and by the end, my feet were blistered and bleeding. I'm in my early 20s now and still experience trauma from my time at school.",,
"5 years ago, my family was moving to a different state and my dad and I stayed behind to finish packing while everyone else went to unpack things from the truck into our new house. We had an inground pool that had lights around it so I wanted to go for a midnight swim with the lights on. And thats where it started. He decided to ""hold me"" as he floated on his back and where he was holding me at was my breasts and whenever I tried to swim away he'd get a tighter grip. Fast forward to that night and I was in bed about to fall asleep when my dad comes in my room and asks to sleep in my bed with me. I say no but he does anyway and he grabs me and spoons me. I try to move away but he doesn't let me so I stay still and try to fall asleep. I wake up as hes reaching his hand under my shirt and under my bra. I just lay there frozen in fear as he does this and pretend to be asleep. He does this for awhile until he finally rolls over and goes to sleep. The next morning I wake up to him doing it again until finally he gets out of bed and leaves my room. Fast forward we are now living in our new house and any chance my dad gets hes grabbing my butt and every morning hes grabbing my boobs while he thinks I'm asleep. He does this while my mom is at work and noone is around to see. One day im on the phone with my boyfriend and im laying in bed and he comes in not realizing im on the phone and slips his hands under my shorts and im repeatedly telling him no and to stop and hes just laughing as if its a game and he was just messing around. Keep in mind my boyfriend is hearing everything going on. So couple days later my boyfriend is wanting to come over and talk to my dad and I say no cuz im not one for confrontation but he comes to my house anyway and has a ""talk"" with my dad.",,
"I was groped and it still affects me to this day, I’m sorry to anyone who’s been through a similar experience.",,
"I was at an award ceremony at my school. I had chosen to wear an ankle length dress. After the ceremony, a guy who had been bullying me all year pulled up my dress so everyone could see my underwear. I was 13",,
"When I was around 14, I got into what I thought would be a great relationship with my boy best friend at the time. I trusted him so I sent him nude pictures of me. He continuously cheated on me with my friends and used my photos and threatened me with exposing me if I ever were to break up with him or not let him sleep with Other people.",,
when i was 15 I was very drunk at one of my first party’s and with my then boyfriend started trying to take me upstairs to do what he said was to “sober me up”. He then went downstairs to get water and i tried to leave the room and go find my friends downstairs but i met him half way up the stairs and he took my arm and took me up to a bedroom. I was sitting on the bed with him and he started getting with me and then went on to finger me while i didn’t know what was going on. After that i fell off the bed onto the floor and when i sat up his trousers were unzipped and he proceeded to grab my hair and make me give him head. Throughout this i kept telling him to stop and that i felt sick and i couldn’t do this but all he kept saying was just a little longer. After he had finished he got up and left me on the floor upstairs and went downstairs and said to his friends it’s fine i got what i wanted and left the party and went home. We never spoke about that night again and ended a few weeks after that as he said that he got bored of the relationship. It took me a while to process what had happened to me and piece it all together and to this day i still get nervous when i see him around school and try to avoid him.,,
"when I was 8 my grandmas friend who was 50 maybe 60 started ""living with us” he had a van that was parked outside of my house and he would sleep in there and one day my mom and grandma went on a walk and I stayed home he came in my room and made me sit on his lap and he would make me touch him and he would touch me at one point he locked me in a room with him and he would put toys in me because he couldn’t physically get hard I told my grandma and my mom and they both let him stay and then they took me to this place and the tested me to see if he had done anything to me and the tests came back positive and nothing happened to him and my grandma still talks to him",,
I was rehearsing for the play and a boy sexually assaulted me in school. i was completely off guard and nothing happened to him once the school found out. i’m still affected by the situation and his behavior towards others has carried on,,
My good friend once groped me and touched me all around my vagina and over my legs completely without my consent. I kept walking away in the room full of people to a different spot but he would make me come back. No one said anything and effectively sexual harassment is ignored in my group because it’s just what these boys ‘are like’,,
"Not my own, but two girls i lived with were raped by the same guy, one more than once. There are several men remaining on campus that are proven rapists.",,
"I’d just moved into year 9 and and had met this new group through my friends boyfriend, they were in the year above and they seemed like nice people so I thought it would be okay to trust them. Some months went by, my friend and her boyfriend had broken up. A few weeks after that I saw one of his friends in this place we call “the bridge” I was in there for practicing my reading and writing as I am dyslexic. He came and sat on my table which was empty other than me , after a while and we both said hi but nothing more and this happened for about two weeks after. Then one day I get a text message on Instagram from this person and for the his privacy I’ll call him James. James had told me that he got my Instagram handle from my friends ex. I had no problem with this as James seemed quite nice and I didn’t think he had any bad intentions. After a few days we starting messaging more until eventually he asked me for my Snapchat which was probably the first red flag because he told me he didn’t use Snapchat because he deleted his account. As soon as the conversation was moved to Snapchat I noticed a change in his behaviour, both over text and in person. He would ask me inappropriate things and he would ask what I was doing before school, during my breaks and after school and every time I made up an excuse because I didn’t know him well enough to go and meet him. When I would ask why , he would make inappropriate comments about me and my body and say that he wanted to do this or that to me and how and go into detail. And as I am already a rape survivor I was creeped out by this behaviour and immediately told my older sister who was in the year above James. After she found out she got me to stop talking to him and to block him. But it didn’t end there. As my sister was in year 11 she was going in early to her interventions so i was going with her as my mum didn’t want me to walk to school by myself. However when we would get to the gates, him and one of his friends would already be there walking up , I never knew why they were there so early as well but I knew some kids just turned up early. When we were walking up James would always turn around and stare at us, making faces and then turning to his friend and laughing. I didn’t think it could get much worse than that until he started coming up to me in school and asking the same questions and this time trying to get me to go with him then. Once again I refused but James never gave up. After a while it calmed down to the point where I started to think that maybe he would leave me alone. That was until I was walking into the inclusion area to go take some medication, I didn’t know he was coming out and I bumped into him as I wasn’t looking where I was going, of course I apologised but it wasn’t good enough for him. He tried to grab my arms to force me to go to the toilets with him but at the same time the first aid teacher who gives me my medication walked out of her office and he immediately stopped as she spoke to me. I never told anyone that happened and my sister still doesn’t know to this day. It took me almost a whole year of all this going on to actually tell a safeguarding teacher about it. They looked through all the messages and took my side of of what happened and as James had already left the school they didn’t do anything. Then when I was in year 10 And i was in what we call the “plc” (personal learning centre) and I turned around as the teacher had called my name for something and as I turned around , James walked in, instantly I felt fearful and anxious. After the lesson, I went and spoke to the deputy head who was also and designated safeguarding lead (DSL), I told her what had happened as she was one of the treachery who looked through the messages and she just said “nothing is going to happen, stop being silly and overreacting ” and in that moment I started crying, I walked away and realised that the school didn’t care. They never did and I was going to have to get through it in my own. 2 years later and I’m now in college, I’ve spoken to James since the situation and he seems to be different and he’s doing good I think. He has apologised which is something I never thought I’d get from him so I was surprised. But I just hope no one in that school has to experience what I did and the teachers not care about it.",,
"Every relationship I had whilst at school and in my teens was defined by the sexual expectations of the boys I dated. One called me frigid and repeatedly threatened to leave me unless I was 'less boring' in the bedroom and agreed to more kink things that he'd seen in porn. The next shut me in a room at a party and wouldn't let me out until I gave him head. He would also refuse to talk to me if I said no and wouldn't let me go to bed on my birthday until I had received birthday sex. I refused and refused and eventually just led there and took it. At another party we were both drunk and making out until I fell asleep. I woke up as he was about to push himself in to me. The next got angry and frustrated every time I said no, to the point that I gave up and just let him do what he wanted. Eventually sex became so painful from years of unwillingness that I now struggle to have sex in a happy relationship because it's psychologically linked to pain for me.",,
I was raped by a senior and after telling teachers the school did nothing,,
"I had just turned a teenager and was out having a meal with my dad and I sit at the table waiting for him to come back as he’d gone to order food and this man just randomly sits in the seat my dad was sat in (it was just one table with a chair each end). dad comes back and questions why he’s sat there and asks him to move which he does but to the table next to us and couldn’t have seemed to care less of how old I was and was just staring at me like an absolute creep, he then proceeds to ask me to go outside with him which I say no to and then I end up having a panic attack because I felt so uncomfortable and clueless of what to do in the situation. Report it to police and to this day they’ve done absolutely nothing about it, it’s now been quite a few years since it happened and I still can’t go back to that place again",,
"I was in year 9 and it was when the majority of girls and guys were having their first sexual experiences. Personally all of my experiences were consensual but I cannot speak for my friends and peers. The boys in our year quickly grew cocky about the amount of girls they were “pulling” and, since there were more girls than guys, they would often use that power to get what they wanted without backlash. I was on the tube once and I was with my 4/5 closest guy friends (I was the only girl) and one of them held me while the others lifted my skirt and grabbed my ass laughing. I laughed about it but I was always so shocked that my closest friends would disregard and degrade me like that, especially in public. I have left now but that moment stuck with me.",,
A couple years back when I was in year 10 a girl I really liked for years and years was starting to like me back. She FaceTimed me one night and I instantly answered she then said you’re my boyfriend now and things like that. She then asked me to meet her the next day and I met her and bought her lunch she then began to touch my private area and I asked her not to. She continued to do this so I got up and left. The next day she told everyone that I faked a relationship with her and when I graduated a couple years back she would make sly remarks about me to my friends,,
"Every lunchtime at school my boy best friend would make me kiss him. One time he made me kiss him, and when we were kissing he started to touch my boob area. I pulled back and told him i was uncomfortable, he hit me and told me to listen to him and do what he says. He started playing touching them again. The next day he start to finger me, i was so uncomfortable. Everytime i told him i didn't like it he would hit me. This went on for 4 years until we went to different secondary schools. Sometimes i see him outside of school at the park and i get terrified. I'm so scared to get close to any boy now because of it.",,
"I’ve had multiple problems with a person who has on many occasions sexual assault me, fat shamed me, degraded me because I am a biological female, and used degrading language with me because I identify as bisexual and I go by she/they pronouns.

We live in the most suicidal county in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and they simply covered that up with a “club” called “The hope squad” and the people in that club would tell me too “kill myself” how do I know?

"I was just 16 and working my first job, there was a man that worked there who was 23 and he would always be lurking near me. One morning I got to work and was looking for my boss but this man came to me and said my boss had asked tht I go with him so I did, I kept asking if my boss knew I was there and he assured me he did. That morning he came closer and closer making me feel uncomfortable untill he put his hand into my back pocket and started squeezing my bum and breathing into my neck. I was so upset but also in shock, I then went to find my boss who had no clue I was there and it’s scary to think what may have happened.",,
"This issue with sexual coercion is such a massive issue and wayyy too common 😔. I liked this guy for a while and he seemed nice but eventually red flags started showing up through messages and his behaviour. He would manipulate me into sending and doing things which I was clearly uncomfortable with. If I said no, he would threaten me with screenshots, and make me feel horrible. There is a lot more to the story but that’s some of it. I know many guys are genuinely nice but unfortunately there are the bad ones you have to look out for!",,
i was raped by someone who goes to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity],,
"I had been talking to this guy for about 7 months before we finally met in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I say talking but all it really was, was him begging me for nudes every night at 12am, 1am etc. I was excited to meet him and thought we would get food and watch something and nothing more because I was on my period. I told him that I didn’t want to do anything multiple times. After we had got some macdonalds and put on a film he started making out with me, I was alright with this, until he started trying to feel me up. I told him no because I was on my period. He didn’t listen and proceeded to stick his fingers inside me all whilst holding my hands down so I was unable to move away from him. When he pulled his fingers out he looked in disgust at me, before cleaning his hands and FORCING me to suck him off. I started crying but every time I tried to pull my head away he used his own hands and pushed my head back, I was gagging and close to throwing up. After he had finished, in my mouth, he made me swallow it. He then told me that I was shit at head and said I shouldn’t have seen him whilst on my period. Later that night he blocked me. The boy was in year 10 at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when this happened.",,
"My first experiences of sexual pleasure were aged 13 (in the 1970s) at the persistent and uninvited hand down my trousers of another boy sat next to me in class. He only lost interest when I refused to go to the toilets with him. I was made to crawl under school desks playing with the private parts of other students, pull down my trousers in class. The blackest day was being taken by a touchy feely teacher to a strangers house during a school trip to a foreign land for a day that I remember absolutely nothing about, other than waking up in the back of his car! All this followed by vicious gossip and bullying around school, somehow painting me as the bad guy. Since then a lifetime of failed friendships and relationships and now alone by choice in this twisted world!!",,
"I was 16. I went to a party to go pick up some friends, greeted by them at the door, they begged me to stay for a while. Being a dumb teen, i obliged. I didn't drink, nor do any other drugs. I was offered many beverages, but i didn't take them. Seated alone on a couch.. a boy, physically bigger and taller than me, walked up and told me one of my friends was in the bathroom throwing up. Knowing she had drank, i had asked him to take me to her. The lights were off, but i didn't think much of it. As i turned the lights on, he pushed me and him into the bathroom, he was quickly followed by two of his friends. I asked them if i could leave, telling them that this was a sick joke they pulled. But instead, one of them put their hand on my mouth as the other two grabbed me and carried me into the bedroom right next to the bathroom. My screams were muffled by his hand, and the music was far too loud for anyone to hear anything. I fought. With every ounce of my body, i fought. But i couldn't break free. My mind went numb as i felt my belt being undone, only thing i could vividly remember was the laughter that filled the room. When When they were done, i was left there. Completely broken. My body was numb, my head was pounding. The next day, we had school. It's summer now, but walking through the halls and seeing him everyday was mentally draining. Passing by him laughing with the same group of friends, hearing the same group of laughter from the night it all happened. I've told administration, but they are far too careless to do anything. In fact, ever since, i've ""coincidentally"" had all the same classes as him. Seated right next to him. Asking teachers if i can switch my seat, them denying it and having to shamelessly walk back to my seat as he stares... knowing exactly why i wanted a new spot in the classroom. Teachers knowing about my rapist, and who he is, and assigning us to be partners in projects. It's unfair. They constantly remind me of that night, thinking it's funny to see me break down in front of them..",,
"I was sexually assaulted when I was 14, by a guy i was talking to. When I spoke to my friends about it they told me ‘it’s not deep’ and if I was getting with him at a party of course it would happen even though I repeatedly told him I didn’t want to. It took me months to realise it was even assault and wasn’t my fault.",,
"I was in the back hallways during lunch to eat quietly when one of my male friends came up to me. I didn't think much of it, considering he was my friend. We had this thing where we'd joke around and make kinky jokes (but always avoided being offensive like kink shaming). One day, I guess someone had told him I had a thing for the bdsm community and that I wanted to get a Domme when I was older. Unfortunately he took that as an invitation to be my domme without asking. Keep in mind, we were in school and minors - which is so wrong already. That day I was eating lunch, he came up to me and started telling me what to do and acting like a domme. I told him to stop but he continued to do it. He then push me against the wall and put his hands down my pants. I yelled stop, but still he did it. I ended up leaving my food and running away from him. I cut off all ties, and completely ignored him for my last year of school.",,
"I was out with my friend in the city and we had drunk a bit too much, we were approached by around 12 guys who told us To come to the park with them and we followed. 8 of them pulled me aside behind a tree and forced my to flash my chest at them, I did so and they came towards me and started to touch me. Later on I was close to passing out and 4 of them forced me to give them head, I thought that I must do it because they may have had knives and they had met up with a group of around 30 people so I would’ve been hurt if I didn’t. Later on my phone was taken by one of the boys who had been in the group with me behind the tree, he started to run away. I eventually managed to talk one of the boys into getting the phone back to me and I got it back by the end of the night. I’ve only shared my story with a few of my close friends and found this was my chance to bring my experience to light in hopes that other people won’t feel so alone. This happened in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity].",,
"I’m not a lesbian, I was raped by one I the bathrooms. It was only us and I cried so much. I’m just in year 10 and they looked like they were in 6th form. It was suspicious that they were in the yr10s bathroom looking for minors.",,
"When i was 13 a boy in my class ran his hands up my legs without consent and then asked me whether it ""made me wet"". I didn't even realize what that meant at that age. i have witnessed boys pretending to smack teachers arses and grab their boobs. Boys have sexualized girls in class, rated their body parts, talked about how rape is ok and women should feel lucky to be raped. Boys have spread sexist and misogynistic messages online including a disbelief of rape culture.",,
"He was my first boyfriend. He told me in was normal and i believed him. I didnt want to do it but he coersed me,guilted me, madd me feel like a bad person if i didnt. he just would not stop asking. After a while it became normal. I only did stuff out of fear. I hate myself for it everyday",,
"There are three instances that stand out to me as particularly harrowing when I think about my experiences of sexual violence. At 13, being molested by my a close family member. At 17, after a failed attempt to be coerced into sex, I was orally raped by a boy in the year below me. At 18 being violently vaginally and anally raped by a 20 year old whilst blackout drunk at a party. If I dig deeper, I remember more. Being forced to go swimming naked at an inappropriate age. Being catcalled by men on the street as I walked home in my school uniform. Being groomed online at 12 in the guise of a modelling agent to solicit ‘sexy’ pictures. Being told I had ‘blow job’ lips and asked for pics by boys at school. The time I was backed up into a wall and aggressively kissed and groped by a 40 year old stranger in a club. The time I resurfaced out of a k-hole go find myself having sex with someone, who I proceeded to get into a casual relationship with. When two days after I was anally raped, drunk and upset, a guy who was supposed to be consoling me ended up having sex with me and tried to instigate anal. When a month later I confronted him and he replied “oh that was definitely on purpose- I have a thing for anal when I’m drunk”. Times I had slept next to good friends at house parties and been felt up without consenting to it. All the countless times I’d slept with someone because I thought it would be the easier option than saying “no”. What’s worse, sexual coercion, or the threat of physical violence at my refusal?",,
"So one time I was on the bus with one of my friends it, we where sat in a double seat right at the back, it was a normal bus ride until this group of about 5 people came on in our local town stop. I knew they where peers and in our year as I recognised the girl from hanging out with her a couple years prior I didn’t know any of the guys though. So I just thought they might be a bit loud but ultimately harmless. BUT NO. They started off loud but then started laughing and I could feel my chair being kicked and it just felt bad, I didn’t know this at the time but they where scratching and touching my friend. Ripping stuff up being loud and obnoxious. Then they started chanting MY NAME and then my friends name then singing a song about how my area smells like fish. My friend has somewhat severe social anxiety so they just freezed up and that’s fine because for them it’s a literal living nightmare. I didn’t retort I didn’t even turn around I mainly just felt this burning pit in my stomach and I’m really bad at confrontation and they probably wanted some kind of retort. I just felt violated mainly due to we couldn’t get off early because we where going over a large area known to be somewhat dangerous and I was unfamiliar with. And I just felt as though my boundaries have been crossed big time. I never expected to be a victim of this level of sexual harassment in public let alone on a bus with my friend. And to know people will try and humiliate you in a place jammed full of adults who don’t even know your name or that it was targeted at me or my friend is the most scary thing. I never reported because I just don’t feel like it and I don’t feel like ruining their job prospects with a harassment case. Even though I could because our busses have cameras everywhere nothing could get by them. I just feel pitty that to play their silly game of mini society levels that they feel some kick out of public harassment of people they haven’t even talked to, to prove that they are superior.",,
"An ex boyfriend (and ex boss) tried to orally rape me and when I said no he dumped me after 2 years of being together. I feel so stupid for staying friends with him after that - I was 15 years younger than him and naive. I cut contact with him a year ago. He’s high up in the TV industry, I don’t think people would believe the extent he psychologically abused me.",,
Boys slap my ass all the time and my friends,,
"I was once on a night out with a friend on holiday and we met those two brothers who happened to be very good looking. Somehow they came to talk to us and we had a great time talking. My friend and I each had our eye on one and we decided to go swimming. I stayed in the water with one of the guys and we swam further away a bit and started kissing. I was so proud of myself because at the time i was incredibly insecure and the fact that he was so good looking made me feel better about myself. But then he started touching me and trying to untie my bathing suit. I pushed his hand away a few times telling him that I didn’t want to. He wasn’t aggressive or too insistant or anything but he said ‘ah, virgin!’ saying that i would be more ‘ liberal if I had more experience’. I then frustratingly swam back. Although nothing happened, it made me feel shit about myself, as if i had been a ‘charity case’ for him. I was so ashamed of being inexperienced, as if it defined who I was as a person.",,
"I have diagnosed PTSD and FND due to the assaults I experienced, and I am hoping sharing this will help me and others. When I was 14, a boy at school was sat next to me in the classroom. He held my hand back behind the chair which injured my wrist and put his hand up my skirt. He shouted, “just let me”. My boyfriend of almost 3 years used to guilt trip me into having sex with him, even when I said that I didn’t want to or didn’t feel like it. A 38 year old at my work gave me a lift home and touched me while he drove, this continued in the work place. I am sexually assaulted pretty much every single day (like many other women) and it is so wrong.",,
"when i was 8 a boy invited me to his house after school, someone i thought i was friends with. he told me to drop my trousers and said he found something out that would feel good. i was in yr 4 we didn’t have sex education yet, i didn’t even know what sex was. he touched me with his genitals and this went on for a while. when we heard his mum start coming up he got me to redress really quickly. i didn’t realise what had happened until yr 8 when i saw him again after primary.",,
"At secondary school sexual harassment was daily for all female students. I started wearing clothes 2 sizes to big in the Hope's it would keep the Male students away from me but I was still groped and harassed. One of my friends would get constantly groped by groups of boys, they would do it in front of teachers and the teachers would say nothing my friend even complained to the teachers who once again did nothing. I ended up leaving school a year early due to my mental health. I know many girls had it worse then me but I was still harrassed/groped despite trying to make myself invisible and shutting myself away in my room after school and eventually leaving school early. There was no escape from it.",,
"The guy got me extremely drunk and took me to his room and got with me while i was almost passed out on his bed but luckily stopped when i asked him to however i know he’s done much worse with extremely drunk floppy girls multiple times, even though he’s always stone sober. His friends see it as just being who he is or gas him up. No one realises how weird it is that he’s always stone sober and the girls are always fed drink until they can hardly stand.",,
"I was staying at my best friend's house in London for a few days. After a small gathering at her house, the boys asked if they could sleep over at her house. There weren't enough beds for everyone so I agreed to sleep in a double bed with one of the boys who was supposedly my good friend. I had never given him any indication that I was romantically interested in him and he had never given me any indication either. We went to sleep as normal but I woke up in the middle of the night to find him rubbing his erect penis into my back. I froze with fear and I could barely breath. He definitely thought I was asleep the entire time because I didn't move at all or ask him to stop. It continued for what felt like forever and I stayed frozen. I felt so dirty and scared in the morning. I wish I'd pushed him away when it was happening or had the confidence to confront him about it in the morning. This happened over 5 years ago but it still makes me feel sick when I think about it, especially because I thought he was my friend and someone I could trust. I never confronted him and we stayed friends for a while.",,
"When I was 16 I was with my boyfriend at the time, we were at a party. I got really drunk and when I was lying down on the sofa he started kissing me and feeling me up. I was so drunk I was barely conscious, but I remember he fingered me without asking. The next day he did it again even after I told him to stop. He only apologised a year later when he thought it would look bad to his new girlfriend if he didn’t.",,
I was trying to get to class when one of my classmates stoped me pinned me against the wall and tried to choke me out. He never got in trouble :/,,
Hearing boys in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] supper talking so loud about the girls they wanted to fuck - so loudly as if it was a declaration of their mission - incredibly objectifying,,
"i was washing the dishes around 8p.m. my mother at the time was working night shifts, as long as my sister. so it was just me and my little sister and my moms husband . keep in mind my moms husband was drinking . as i was washing the dishes i felt a body heat behind me and as i was going to turn around he grabbed me tightly so i couldn’t move . he lowered his hand to touch my front part and i was pushing and trying to get out . i ran in my room and locked the door . i told my mom and she’s still with him till this day . there’s many other stories but this is just one that absolutely makes me feel disgusted.",,
"In 2019, i met this guy who had a bad reputation but i still went for it and one day during break we sat outside with both of our group of friends and he started to touch me even when they saw he didn’t stop i would try to move away closer to them but he wouldn’t let me, and none of them try to stop they left me. And he continued to touched me and no one ever told the school and i was to scared and till this day he still is here",,
A boy put his hands in my pockets when he sat next to me in class. he'd touch my thigh and then claim he was playing a game called 'fish'. he didn't stop when i told him i was uncomfortable,,
"(I don't live in the uk, but I hope it's still okay to share) At my middle school girls can't go around without boys doing inappropriate things. For example once I was running for the one mile run and boys kept looking at my boobs and even maid ""comments"" on them. I feel very uncomfortable around them, and I had male friends who asked inappropriate questions that made me feel very uncomfortable. I was called ""flat"", and when I would reject any guy they would call me ugly and a lesbian, I'm bi too so that made me scared to come out for the longest time. I was also sexually assaulted multiple times out of school, like once at a sleepover at my friend's house. Me, my friend, and her brother where going camping out side in a tent together for fun. She got too cold and went inside, I stayed inside of the tent because I never saw it that eay, I just wanted to go to sleep. After awhile of me just scrolling on my phone he said ""let's watch a movie"", I said yes as I thought it was harmless. When I laid down next to the computer to watch this movie he laid on top of me and started touching my boobs. I was so scared I just tried to laugh and leave as soon as I could. It was disgusting, I hated it, I never gave consent. My family mentions my body going through puberty and I wish they could just leave me alone. - anonymous from us",,
"when i went to a football match at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when i was 9, i was with my family. during the security scan, i was groped by the guard, and i felt so embarrassed but also confused. my parents laughed it off and now i realise how wrong that was but i felt so so powerless. it was a horrible experience, particularly being such a young girl",,
"When I was with my ex, he frequently asked me to try threesomes and anal sex with him, both things I had never agreed to or felt fully comfortable with (I would often say maybe but never agreed) one night, we were drinking and hanging out with a friend. We were all drunk and he was pushing for a threesome, even though she had a boyfriend too and I had clearly said I wasn’t comfortable. She ended up leaving. I was very very drunk and can only remember we were suddenly having anal sex, and I started having a panic attack and falling asleep. I broke up with him the next morning but he continued to beg me for sex and I agreed because I just wanted to feel loved by him and that was the only way. Whenever I told him I didn’t want to have sex anymore or that I thought we should just be friends, he would get upset and adamant. He had been hooking up with loads of people since we broke up without telling me, and still expected sex from me. I finally was able to cut it off but I felt disgusting and used and had repeated nightmares for months.",,
"I was at a party once, at a close friends house, I got incredibly drunk. Through the night I had been talking to a guy there, he was a mate of a mate, I hadn’t met him before this night but I had heard of him. We flirted and shared a kiss or two, but as the night progressed and I got so drunk I couldn’t walk I went off to bed. I woke up to his fingers inside me. I pushed him off and said no, but he persisted. So I just laid there. I didn’t know what else to do, all I could think was he will stop soon. He had violated my body before I was even conscious and even when I had awoken and said no he still continued. I occasionally still hear someone mention his name, and this is the first memory that comes to my mind. Please educate your sons.",,
I’ve had my legs touched during lessons without consent whatsoever and been called several sexual names throughout my school years despite none of them being relatable to me.The school did nothing to help me.,,
I got sent unsolicited inappropriate pictures of a guys penis every day for 6 months. I was 14 and too scared to tell him to stop.,,
On a night out after final year exams I was at the pub with friends. They had invited a few of their friends out so was a group of us one of the guys and I got along well and were chatting all night. I’d had a lot to drink and we ended up getting with each other consensually. Later on that night we were at his friends house and we’re about to have sex when I asked about him having protection as I didn’t. He said he didn’t and so I said I don’t want to have sex. He forced himself on me as I lay there crying and saying “no stop”. I’ve always been told whenever I’ve talked about sexual assault in the past one thing “but you didn’t say no” even though I’ve said/done other things. This time I did it all and it still happened. That’s when it finally dawned on me that you just can do everything and bad stuff happen anyways. That’s why we need to educate children about consent rather than teach our kids to protect themselves.,,
"When I was in Year 7 I was exposed by classmates to pornography. At first it was on their phones in school, then it was via private messages and links they’d send without warning of content. This is so normalised that I thought it was just a common occurrence that wasn’t problematic. It’s just so common to be sent that content without any warning, even at a young age of eleven.",,
"I was in Year 8 and a boy I wasn't really friends with started to talking to me more and started being more friendly with me. He was really nice and polite and I thought we were going to become good friends but after a few days he asked me if he could touch me inappropriately. I didn't know what to say because he was very popular and if I said 'no', I was worried he would spread rumours about me. I said yes and he took me behind a building in school and started kissing me and touching me. I felt visibly uncomfortable but he wouldn't stop and eventually I pushed him off of me. He acted as if nothing had happened but then stopped talking to me all together after a couple of days. I felt absolutely disgusting. I haven't told anyone about it.",,
"I was sitting on a bench with my friend when this guy came up to us and was asking us loads of questions like ‘are you horny right now?’ and ‘do u wanna come back to my house?’ and trying to bribe us to go with him, whilst he was touching and rubbing up on me. No matter how many times we told him to fuck off and leave us alone he wouldn’t leave. What made it even worse was despite it being daytime and both of us looking visibly uncomfortable, making eye contact with people walking right by us for some help, no one helped or bothered to ask if we were ok.",,
"I got added on snap by a boy in the year above me, he didn’t know I went to his school but I knew he went to mine. He added me and straight away he sent a snap saying how old are you. I was 13 at the time and he was 15. After I told him my age and he continued snapping me. After a few days of snapping me he sent me a picture of him only wearing underwear but I never sent him any revealing pictures. After not even a week of knowing him he asked me if I send nudes and I said no (i was only 13). After I said I didn’t send nudes he unfriended me. The next day I got snaps from a few other boys asking the same stuff and after a few days later, they asked if I sent nudes and every time I said no. After I said no they all unfriended me on snap. He told the boys to all ask for my nudes and planned to share them if anyone of them received any. Now when I see any of them in the corridor I have a panic/anxiety attack because I am scared they will start rumours. Please keep this anonymous.",,
"In my first year I was getting to know the students in my halls . We met in the common room . We were all having fun when everyone laughed and told me I got tea bagged . I had no idea what this meant . I later found out that it meant some one had come up behind me whilst I was sat on the floor and slapped their penis on my head without me knowing. I know who did it , it makes sick , I never reported it because it seemed to be about the uni culture.",,
"I was sexually assaulted on multiple accounts by a fellow student that was in one of my classes. Another student came forward about the situation because it happened to her too. They found hours of evidence of him inappropriately touching multiple girls. Stopping them in hallways, lunchtime, even in class where a teacher was present. Yet, nothing happened to him and he now goes to my high school when i asked for him to not be near me. Next year we will have the same classes and i’m scared it can happen again. He has tried to come up to me during school now and message me on social media. I don’t understand how the staff chose to NOT prevent this issue from happening again.",,
"In my elementary school, I was repeatedly inappropriately touched by boys in my grades. Boys would cat call me and some would bring other girls down saying why cant they be built the way I was when we were just all 11-12. Parents, please educate your sons.",,
I have received many unsolicited images and have not consented to any type of physical touch by boys in my school and it took many tries for them to actually listen to me.,,
"I had this boyfriend and we were both 15, sexual assault had never really been talked about so i didnt know what was okay and what was not. He would touch me inappropriately during school even when i asked him to stop. He would put his hand up my skirt and tell me that it was fine there. I thought that that was how things went in a relationship and that i just had to suck it up and deal with it. People i didnt know would come up to me and tell me “you look really uncomfortable” or “why is he always touching you like that? Its so weird” my only response was ‘well he’s my boyfriend’. When i finally realised that that wasnt supposed to be happening i went to the school and they handled as they should, however the faculty and students never treated him any differently. he is still considered the ‘golden boy’ while people told me i over exaggerated my story for attention. some of my friends are still close friends with him and a few of my girl friends have even gone on dates or tried to be in a relationship with him, even though ive told them about the panic attacks i still get.",,
I was sexually assaulted by a boy my year. He had sex with me a second time when I didn't want to. I had wanted to stop. He then tried to have sex a third time. He forced me to suck his dick. He told me to stop telling people. He told them i was crazy. I finally went to title nine people and they said the only way I could do it was by being silent and going through the legal process of a case. I just wanted to report him anonymously. He is dangerous and I shouldn't have to prove that it happened for him to get in trouble. My trauma is enough proof. Why would I lie about this? I have nothing to gain.,,
"So back where I was 14 I got raped by a guy who I put all my trust into for the longest time and I loved and cared about him. It happened twice. He made it seem like he was there for me when no body else was and at the time made me feel like I should have been grateful for the fact that he showed me any sexual interest at all. The first time it was december. He begged and begged me to have sex with him and I REALLY did not want to because I just wasn’t in the mood. I made excuses after excuses and said I was sick but he still kept begging. He pulled the back of my trousers and underwear down and began to attempt to fuck me. I kept saying I didn’t want to and I kept saying stop but he didn’t listen and I just stayed silent until he stopped. I picked my stuff up afterwards and went home crying on the tube. I didn’t properly process the fact that this was rape until later so I carried on talking to him probably because I was infatuated. It then happened again in January while he’s just gotten back together with his girlfriend but it was so so much worse. When I spoke out about it he told everyone that I’d lied about it, I felt so alone and isolated I attempted to take my life. Because of this event I now have substance abuse issues and extreme diagnosed PTSD. I know he’s done this to other people and it’s time for it to stop.",,
On my school bus one of the sixth formers (18) started ranking all the girls on the bus. He referred to the two older girls (year 9 - 14 years old) as ‘fitties’ which they seemed to enjoy. He then looked at me and my friend who weren’t involved in the conversation and called us ugly dogs who would never get boyfriends. We were 11 and had just started secondary school. I never told anyone because I was so upset by it.,,
"It was common knowledge that boys in our friendship group during sixth form had “locked” albums on their phones, that contained the nudes of various girls in the year group or wider school that is they would share among themselves. Certain boys even bragged about sharing their current girlfriend’s pictures with their friends.",,
I’m a guy but think it’s important for orher mandem to see this and know it can happen to us too n don’t make u less of a man. I was at work as a waiter and i normally had an apron round the front of me. A drunk man one night while with his family slipped me a tip down the front of my apron but thought it would be a good idea to let his hands do whatever he wanted to to my dick and groped me. I never wore the apron after that shift,,
"I ended up sleeping on a floor mattress with a guy I didn't know at all after a party because there were too many people and too few beds. He started grinding on me. I didn't engage. He put my hand down his pants. I started giving him a hand job. He pushed my head down a couple times but I refused then left. Did not sleep a wink that night. Never spoke to him about it, but after leaving school I found out he pressured a number of girls into giving him blow jobs, one time on the street. The most disappointing thing is that his mates definitely knew he was a total creep and never did or said anything to my knowledge.",,
"I was walking home from a friends house at age 16, when I was approached from behind and tapped on the shoulder. when i turned around there as a large man standing there, wearing a balaclava, masturbating with his trousers down. It was in broad daylight around 3pm. I froze for a few seconds and then ran. I was 2 minutes from my parents house. I am now 46 years old & this frightening experience changed the way I live. i never walk alone and constantly check on my daughter and girlfriends when they go out.",,
"I used to attend a secondary school in [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Whilst attending [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I had a pretty new relationship with a guy I thought was nice. After about a month the guy completely flipped. Especially at school. I was cornered in classrooms, pressured to send nudes and threatened that if I didn't he would find them or take them himself and distribute all round the school and all social media platforms. He sent me unsolicited nudes and said I then owed him the same in return. This kind of behaviour carried on for 3 months. In lessons he would put his hand on my upper thigh and try put his hand up my skirt making me visibly uncomfortable. In locker rooms he would do the same as well as trying to put his hands in my shirt and bra, physically restraining my hand if I tried to move it away or stop him. He even went as far as slapping me across the face if I disrespected him. I came in to school multiple times with bruises on my arms and legs that he forced me to cover up with uniform. He would make public comments about the size of my chest in-front of other pupils and even teachers. If I ever mentioned leaving him he would threaten to kill himself and I received multiple texts saying he was about to commit suicide if I didn't send images of a sexual nature. When I refused he would send all kinds of threats and that it would all be my fault if he killed himself and he would make sure everyone knew that. He said multiple times if I went to the school he would turn it round on me and I would get kicked out. When I did leave him I told a friend what had happened and was strongly advised to talk to a teacher. I went to the head of pastoral care and told them everything that had happened. All though I did not have evidence to back up everything I could prove the main things and knew the school had cameras to prove other things along with witness statements from friends and teachers to further prove this. The school sat me in a room and told me they could not do anything. They did not check any CCTV footage, they did not look at my evidence and they did not talk to any of my friends. Instead, they told said I could go the the police if I wanted but I would have to stand in front of people and tell everyone what 'I' had done and how badly it would reflect on me and I would have to be stood in front of him the whole time. I was asked multiple times if I had done anything to lead him on or provoke him and every time I said no I was meant with 'Are you sure?' 'It's ok if you didn't mean to.' They never took into consideration how it affected me and continues to do so to this day, and this time of my life will stay with me forever, affecting all my relationships since and having nightmares about the experience I had which school have done nothing to help with or rectify. If only schools realise how big of a problem this is for all pupils, maybe this story would not have to be relived.",,
"In year 8, during science class. I was repeatedly groped under my skirt by a male pupil as I walked past or bent over to go into a cupboard.",,
"I was at a gathering and I was really drunk. This boy took me over to a quieter area and kept insisting that I kissed him. It was fine at first because I just said no and he seemed to respect that but he constantly kept asking. It got to a point that I just wanted to get away but he was so much stronger than me that I couldn’t escape. He kept touching all over me and I felt really uncomfortable but he wouldn’t let me go. My friends came over and had to eventually force him off of me. Despite not necessarily being as severe as other cases, the fact that he physically prevented me from escaping was really scary",,
"I was drunk after a night out at uni and I went home with this boy. He seemed really nice and I wanted to have sex with him. When we got back to his room we started kissing and he took my top off. I was so drunk I had forgotten I was on my period and needed to change my tampon, so I told him I didn't want to have sex with him and needed to leave. I was too embarrassed to admit why. He started acting annoyed and asking why I'd bothered to go home with him if I wasn't going to give him anything. He told me I should stay and we didn't need to have penetrative sex, that I should give him head instead. When I said I wanted to leave he just lay on the bed, holding my top and acting annoyed. He refused to give me my clothes several times, taunting me with them and suggesting we have sex. The door was locked and he made me nervous. I eventually left and it wasn't until a few months later I realised how fucked up it was that I felt grateful to him for 'letting' me leave without having sex with him, in my head this made him one of the 'good' guys. I laughed it off but I think about it often.",,
"I was interrailing with some friends and we bumped into boys from our school. One guy egged on his mate and I didn’t notice until this boy grabbed my face and aggressively got with me. He then followed me around and kept trying to get me to sit on his lap. I went to the toilet to try to escape him and he was waiting outside. I managed to find a friend who told me to run and he distracted this guy. The next week there was a rumour going round that I had got with him, but it wasn’t consensual. It was assault. And it was scary.",,
"I was only 16 and my boyfriend of the time used to guilt me into doing sexual things I wasn’t comfortable with or ready for. This ranged from performing oral sex to penetrating sex, and his reasoning was that I didn’t love him enough if I wouldn’t do it.",,
"My school forgot to teach us sex Ed. They told us about what sex was and how you got pregnant in year 7 and then it wasn’t til we alerted them that we had been forgotten about in year 9 (when a couple of people were already sexually active) they got a couple of medical student to come in for 10 minutes before school started at 8am. They had no experience of teaching a class, got completely shouted over, and only told us about STIs. Nothing about women’s health/UTIs/endometriosis/painful sex/consent/rape/coercion NOTHING!,Due to endometriosis/previous trauma I found sex extremely painful, and my boyfriend when I was 18 was “okay” with that. I tried to have sex with him a couple of times but it was too painful. I wasn’t taught how to deal with these situations, and instead felt huge pressure to pleasure him and “make up” for the fact that I couldn’t fulfil his needs. He constantly complained of having blue balls, saying it was extremely painful, that he HAD to finish, otherwise He couldn’t sleep. I would give extremely uncomfortable blowjobs that he would coerce and guilt trip me into which would leave me feeling uncomfortable and nauseous, however I thought that was what I owed him. Looking back it makes me feel sick that he enjoyed these sexual experiences that he practically had to beg me for.,I feel completely cheated by my education that I didn’t get educated that blue balls were not even a REAL thing. I genuinely only learned about this in my twenties. If there was more education about endometriosis and painful sex and validation of this condition I feel this wouldn’t have happened.",,
"After a party, a group of us had a sleepover. I woke up in the middle of the night everyone else having left the room and my male friend fingering me. I said what are you doing? And he just told me to shhhh. I don’t really remember what else happened as I was quite drunk, I likely fell back to sleep. I didn’t tell anybody for a while, and then I heard the same boy had raped another friend. The school said they would support the boy if the girl wanted to take it to court.",,
"I don't have any friends at my school or any social life at all really, but I've overheard boys in my classes taking the piss out of how people have not managed to get with at all or are still a virgin by the time they are in year 13 and they make fun of people who are not 'good' enough with girls, which basically sounds like they are making fun of people who don't do anything bad enough for someone to write a testimony about them here. Being constantly isolated at school is humiliating enough as it is, but then people indirectly making fun of you all the time is really painful. It also just shows how strong this rape culture is. Everyone's also talking about how they think these stories are fake or overexaggerated and they think ""some of these stories are actually quite fit"".",,
"When I was 16 I was raped by my boyfriend in my sleep. I only found out what happened because I woke up in so much pain and I was bleeding. I couldn’t process what had happened to me because I was so in love with him. The relationship then became sexually abusive with him always ending up having sex with me no matter how many times I said no. He had previously threatened to kill himself or harm himself if I left him but I finally got the courage to leave at the end of year 12. I told my sixth form about what had happened as I was really struggling to go to school with him being there. I went to the police and instead of excluding him as the school should have done due to there being a text from my ex saying he had raped me, they didn’t exclude him because Catholic schools have a “forgiveness policy”. Jesus would have forgiven him, so we have to as well. My year 13 experience was the worst year of my life. He wouldn’t stay away from me, school was hell but I couldn’t leave or I would have to start sixth form again. Having to see him every day while I tried to do my a levels was horrific. I still have severe symptoms of ptsd. He has walked free and has no exclusions on his record. Meanwhile my parents paid hundreds on my therapy and I still struggle to trust men my age. The school failed to protect me when I needed it most. This was from 2017-2018 and I don’t know if Catholic schools have amended their policies.",,
I was a minor and I was getting changed in cubicles at the swimming pool that had gaps below the doors. Next thing I saw was a phone held under the toilet door trying to take photos of me getting changed.,,
"I was told to stay after-school by one of my male teachers as I was falling behind in his class. I worked for about 15 minutes until I was told to “help him carry equipment from the storage room”. So I went into the store room with him and he tried to kiss me and I tried to get away but the door was locked and I was trapped in the room. I was raped and have found myself thinking I am dirty because I was so young but really, he was the one to blame.",,
"okay so, there's a boy and he's been going around touching girls and sending inappropriate messages as well as asking for nudes, when me and the other victims spoke up, we were all excluded whereas the boy was not, this school silences the victims of sexual harrasment/assult police are involved as well as many angry parents, the boy uses his sexuality as an excuse to go around touching girls, the school silences the victims and defends the sex offenders!!",,
"When I was around 10 years old, I was out alone walking my dog and a man grabbed me and took advantage of me. I was dressing for the weather and I still feel disgusted.",,
"Sadly, like others, I have many stories to choose from. When I was 20 years old I was working at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. There had been a lock-in and at 2am I was outside stacking chairs. A man, who was probably 50 and who I had served a drink to earlier in the night, came outside and pushed me hard against the wall. He groped me and tried to kiss me too - I struggled and managed to get away. I went inside the bar and told the Manager - [X] - what had happened. [X] said ""what do you expect me to do - he's a loyal paying customer"". Going to the Police didn't feel like an option. That was 20 years ago and I still feel angry about it now - it's sad to see how slow progress has been and that for many, going to the Police is still not an option. I've shared the University that I went to because, although this man was not a student, there were plenty of students who behaved in a similar way and got away with it.",,
"I was at a party and I started to make out with the boy in the main room. i was drunk and he dragged me into the toilets nearby and locked the door. i remember making out with him in the toilet but then i passed out from alcohol. when i regained consciousness, my shorts were on the floor and he was trying to make me do stuff to him. i remember clearly saying no him him, whilst falling in and out of consciousness. then i remember he pinned me against the wall and attempted to rape me however i was hardly conscious so he couldn’t. then my friend asked him after if he had sex with me, and he said “i put the tip in for a second” like he hadn’t just sexually assaulted me. i was 15 at the time.",,
"I started off being friends with this boy, but he realised I liked him, he took advantage of that and we began seeing each other. He told me I wasn’t good looking enough to be his girlfriend and he was too ashamed to tell anyone about us. He would often tell me that in order to get hard he had to imagine that I was this other girl in my year (who was blonde and white) during sex. Having gone to a girls’ school all my life, I was so naïve and had no self-esteem so I believed the things he said and accepted the abuse because he made me feel it was what I deserved. He would threaten me, telling me that if I dared tell a single person about our relationship he’d ruin me by telling everyone in the year, the teachers and my parents the graphic details of sexual encounters we’d had. The fear of that information coming out terrified me into silence because the culture of spreading warped rumours, slut shaming girls and destroying their reputations at Westminster was so powerful and irreversible. When we were alone together, he’d punch me and kick me to the point where I’d have awful bruises and even bled. He’d tell me afterwards that it was just play fighting. One time he shoved me into a hard piece of furniture in an empty school common room. The impact with a corner against my stomach hurt so badly that I can’t remember how many minutes I was lying in pain on the ground for. He just sat and watched me while laughing and telling me to get up and stop being dramatic. He would comment on my appearance every single day, telling me I was ugly and how I had to straighten my hair because he wasn’t attracted to me with my natural hair. He criticised every part of my body, leaving my cripplingly insecure. He told me he was so disgusted that he didn’t want to look at me on days where I had acne on my face. Getting pimples became my worst fear because of the abuse I knew I’d get, and I’d try to scratch them off my face to the point of scarring to protect myself from it. He said that I should be so grateful that he allowed me to have sex with him. He forced me to block other boys who showed interest in me, and the one time we hung out with other people – his friends who didn’t know anyone from our school – he groped me and forcibly fingered me under the table in front of them to assert his claim over me as I engaged in conversation with one of them. He made me feel so ashamed about the sexual nature of the relationship, he constantly called me a slut for doing the things he asked me to do. He waited until just before my A level exams to dump me and tell me that he had only used me for sex and that the entire time he had manipulated me and taken advantage of the fact I liked him. He said he chose to dump me at that time because I was already extremely stressed and reeling from other personal losses, and so he wanted to be the one to send me to rock bottom. At the time, I felt so dirty and corrupt that I couldn’t bring myself tell anyone about what he did to me. I stayed silent out of fear of his threats against me if I ever spoke out. And even if I did, I was terrified that information would get passed around the school and, as the girl, I’d take the blame for being a whore, and while he’d be respected by his friends for playing a girl so brutally and gaining sexual experience I’d be seen as untouchable damaged goods. I was totally isolated and had to deal with the excruciating aftermath alone whilst sitting my final exams. My experience at Westminster was traumatising and I have sought serious professional help in the process of recovering.",,
"i was out drinking with friends, i had a few too many tequila shots and was essentially blackout. i don’t remember anything from that night, i only know what my friends told me. the boys that were there all came onto me kissing me and stuff like that. then i was being filmed by another boy and whilst he was filming i tripped over and my dress fell down & i didn’t have a bra on so my breasts were out. some were saying he deleted whereas others aren’t sure. this boy was completely sober and i’m so scared that he has a video of me like that on his phone. i feel too embarrassed to see my friends i have just stayed home since this all happened",,
"A couple of years back I had an unpleasant experience involving a guy from the same sports club as me. I was incredibly drunk and have no recollection of going back to his after the night out. In my blacked out state we had sex. The only moment I remember from the night is him asking if he could do a specific thing, and me telling him no multiple times. He still went ahead despite me explicitly voicing that I would not consent to that. Once I woke up I left immediately feeling disgusting. I was on no form of contraception at the time (presumably something he didn’t bother to ask about before going ahead with sleeping with a blacked-out drunk girl), so had to go and get emergency contraception, and during the consultation it began to dawn on me that the encounter had not been consensual. The following week everyone I knew in the sports club teased me about that night. He was good friends with some of my friends, a ‘good guy’, so everyone took it as lighthearted banter that was their business. I felt so alone, I couldn’t even tell my close friends about what had really happened. It wasn’t until two or three months after the incident that I confided in my closest friends about it, who responded supportively. But nothing can reverse the amount of anxiety this experience inflicted, and continues to inflict upon me.",,
"We were leaving the bar I tried to say I would go and catch up with my friends but he insisted I get in the Uber with him, I was a bit drunk at the time so I just agreed. When we got back to his room we tried to have sex with a condom which I insisted on but he couldn’t get hard. After I said it was fine and we should just stop so we did. But then a few minutes later he insisted on trying again and it wasn’t until after that I found out that he didn’t use a condom. Also he told me the next morning that I needed to get tested and he was worried that I gave him an std. After not using a condom he made me feel so horrible.",,
"""I was sexually assaulted in secondary school. I was walking to my next lesson. I asked for a bit of water from this lad I knew! (I was 15 at the time) by this point everyone had left. After this I walked towards the door. Where I was pinned. There was a camera but it didn’t reach where it happened. I froze as he rubbed his hands all over my body. Feeling every part of me. I ran to my maths lesson. N burst out in tears. ,I told my mum who rung the school. I got pulled into countless meetings. By a councillor who told me “it’s just boys being boys” I was told this by many teachers. I felt isolated. I felt like I was being made out to be a liar. It went round my whole school I was a liar etc and I hated going to school. I spoke up and I was silenced. I was called a liar because of his account. Everyone in school thought I was dramatic. I had a very difficult life that not many know or understand. I wasn’t being dramatic. I was speaking out. I was asking for help. All he got was an after school detention and that was that because it “was boys being boys”.,He then went on and assaulted another 10+ girls. Where nothing was done. He was known as a predator by other schools in my area. Many people in other schools believed me as they’d saw what he did to girls at parties.""",,
I was raped by 2 boys in my class the teachers knew and made me sit with them for 4 years when my family went to talk to them they said i couldn’t get special treatment.,,
In 8th grade this boy told me “let’s play a game” I asked “how do you play it and what’s it called?” He said it’s called red light green light. And he said that he would touch my leg and if it ticked to say red light. So I was like ok that sounds alright we were playing and he squeezed my leg going up and on the third he shot up from just above my knee to my area. I didn’t think much of it before but I felt weird about it after.,,
I had no idea it was even rape until a year later. My now ex-boyfriend used coercion all the time to get me to sleep with him. coercion is also rape. emotional abuse is as damaging as physical abuse. everyone deserves to be heard,,
"My first time was with my current bf, we were making out in his car before I went to work and I said no but didn't realise he'd pulled it out and he tried to anyway, he couldn't get it in but managed to tear me and when I cried he laughed and said it was because he was too big. I didn't think much of it and we had sex properly that weekend which was good, however yesterday he met my parents after we went on a date, while we were on the date he tried to have sex with me but I said no, he tried to pull of my jeans and I was trying to play it off but I got really scared, he then got upset and told me he was worried about us.",,
When I was 10 or 11 I was sexually assaulted by my best friend. I would go to their house almost every week and the whole time they’d make us watch porn and they would touch my inner thighs. I never talked about it until this year. I told someone I trusted and they went and told my sexual assaulter. My sexual assaulter went to my school and reported me for coming forward and said my claims weren’t true. My school did not care and they did nothing to help me or get the student who sexually assaulted away.,,
"When I just turned 18 I was on a night out with my friend and we ended up going somewhere to get food and whiles we were waiting for our food, a Middle Aged man just walked up to me and slapped my arse and I couldn’t believed what just happened. He just laughed and walked away like it was nothing. It was so embarrassing and so humiliating and on the way home in a Uber I was just balling myself eyes out. I honestly wished I could of done something there and then like told the security guard or something.",,
In halls boys would try complete I think it was called a golden week where they would sleep with a different night each day of the week,,
When I was in year 9 my then boyfriend at the time would pressure me for nudes 24/7 and I’d feel obliged to send them. I said no for weeks and I eventually gave in. After we broke up because I felt uncomfortable around him I found out he had shown them to his friends and shared them around because we had a mutual friend who found out. When I told my friends I got told it was my fault for sending and I cried myself to sleep for weeks because I felt so exposed and I felt it was me to blame. He tried to touch me inappropriately too but I stopped him most of the time.,,
Was told in year 7 that a boy would fuck me if I had a paper bag over my head.,,
My lecturer sent me a private message on zoom saying he was imagining me naked and that I was too pretty to be studying.,,
"When I was 16 I started dating a boy in the year above, all of my friends who were in his year kept telling me how popular he was and how it was a major deal to be seen dating him. Right from the start I felt pressured into the relationship but I carried on anyway. After a few weeks I ended up losing my virginity to him, I lied about not being a virgin because I was embarrassed that he had been with lots of people and I hadn’t. The whole night was just uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all - he only cared about himself and never made sure I was ok. We drove out into the countryside one day and he pulled the car up into a public car park where walkers would park to go up the hills. He tried to pressure me into having sex with him in the back of the car and I resisted and refused. He dumped me the next day.",,
Ex boyfriend raped me,,
I was really drunk and I had basically passed out. The next day I found out from someone else things that had happened between me and this guy that I still have no memory of.,,
"I was insanely drunk at a party which I never usually am, and a boy I didn’t know put his hands in my trousers and proceeded to sexually assault me and I never resisted because I was in and out of consciousness and always blamed myself.",,
"About two years ago I was in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], and (not that it matters because what you wear doesn’t equal consent) but I was wearing long trousers and was dancing with mates when I guy groped my ass with the hardest pinch I’d ever felt. When I turned around and asked him why the hell he did it he just said “well I thought you were asking for it”.",,
"I was raped when I had just turned 15 by a boy that everyone at my school loved, I could never say anything as I would be hated but it still kills me everyday to think of how little control I had over my own body.",,
I was raped at 14 by my boyfriend at the time. People found out about it a few months ago and it went to police. The case got dropped and I now have to see him every day and can’t do anything about it,,
"I was raped by a man significantly older than me, who denied it and said I needed psychological help. I went to the police a couple hours after it happened, reported it, got a rape kit, had a recording of the call where I confronted him etc. it didn’t even make it to court. I wish I never reported it because the process took an entire tear and had me reliving the trauma over and over. I was suicidal, self harming & had to go on SSRIs.",,
"I was walking down my school corridoor and a boy wolf whistled at me in my skirt and I was also groped. I had a male teacher tell me ""boys will be boys"" and he was the same teacher who made me feel uncomfortable by getting really close to me. He is no longer a teacher there.",,
I’ve been groped multiple times by both the girls and boys in my school. The teachers were watching but did nothing about it.,,
I was at a New Year’s Eve party and a friend of mine repeatedly tried to coerce me into sex after repeatedly being told no. I later found out that he had done the same thing to other girls that night.,,
The guy took the condom off without my permission while we were having sex,,
"I think the saddest thing about how pervasive rape culture was at school was that the girls didn’t know to stand up for one another, or at least were too scared to. Slut shaming and victim blaming were so normalized that we all went along with it, we couldn’t recognize how wrong it was in the moment because we were all conditioned by the same fucked up culture. I lost friends when I lost my virginity, because they deemed me too slutty and changed. Once I was harassed and yelled at by a guy for not getting with him when we were walking home together after a party. He spoke to me as if I owed him something, and became explosive when I said no multiple times. I almost gave in, thinking it would be easier to just go home with him and shut him up. My friends at school blamed me for it, saying that I should have expected it because I was alone with him and that me walking home alone with him equaled consent. I was also added to a groupchat with 10+ [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys (most of whom i didn’t know) after getting with a guy at a party, the sole purpose of which was to slut shame me. I felt disgusting and embarrassed, but also didn’t understand that that wasn’t deserved. It’s only now, almost six years out of sixth form, that I’m realizing how fucked up it all was. These perverse gender dynamics and this rape culture gave me complexes that I’m still working through, and I know that many of my peers are the same.",,
"It started when i was in secondary school boys would slap my bum, talk about it, make comments about it and purposely wait to walk behind me. I knew it hat they were doing and it made me feel so uncomfortable. When my guy friend stopped a lad from slapping my bum the lad tried to fight my friend. He felt so entitled that he could slap my bum.",,
"For two terms I was groped by my lab partner in chemistry class. I was scared to say anything and didn't know who to speak to because I was embarrassed, and there wasn't a clear structure for reporting these things. I felt vulnerable and powerless and still think about it happening.",,
"When I was 15, I had a local group of friends mixed between our girls and boys grammar schools. We’d meet up and smoke weed and listen to music pretty regularly. One time, three of us decided to meet up to have a smoke and just chilled in our male friend’s bedroom. I smoked a lot and was really monged out, and when my female friend wasn’t looking, my male friend decided to come behind me a grope my vagina. I was really shocked, my head was fuzzy and I just laughed it off. He gave us some more puff and then again when my female friend went off somewhere he started kissing me. She came back in and saw so decided to leave feeling uncomfortable. He then made me feel bad when I backed away and then continued until he was penetrating me and I reluctantly accepted it without protest, feeling really strange and not with it. I went home afterwards and the next day when I was sober he told me he had laced the weed with LSD. I hadn’t consented to taking LSD. I felt really betrayed and I spoke to my female friend about it, who told me that was rape. I tried speaking to him about it afterwards, I think he felt a little bit bad but asked me not to take any action as it would ruin his future prospects and career. I’ve stayed silent forever.",,
"I was out with my friends after school on a Friday night. I was around 13 years old. For some reason, a group of boys I went to school with, who were also my age, thought it was acceptable to pin me down to the ground. It came out of nowhere. For a few minutes I was wriggling, screaming and trying to get away from them while they were laughing and egging each other on. They were touching me inappropriately and threatening to take my clothes off. Eventually they pulled my top and bra down exposing my breasts. I was with a female friend at the time who didn’t know what to do. She asked them to stop but I think she was worried that if she intervened it would happen to her. They finally let me go when another boy in my year group saw what was happening and told them to stop. Not only did the boys not grasp what they had done was wrong, they also went on to make disrespectful comments about my body to others at school the following week. This led to people teasing me for the next few months. This particular incident was the worst but it wasn’t the only one. It was common occurrence for the boys in our school to randomly grope the girls. This happened mainly in the school yard but also happened in lessons. I couldn’t wear a skirt to school because the boys would slap our legs or lift our skirts up. They would comment that we must enjoy the attention otherwise we wouldn’t wear skirts.",,
"Last summer a guy was talking to me on Snapchat a lot. He was a sophomore (15) because he skipped a grade and I was in eighth grade (14). We were talking to each other a lot and I thought he had feelings for me. He asked me if I wanted to meet up and I said yes after my “friends” pressured me into it. When he got to my house it was 2 a.m. and everyone in my house was sleeping, and we were in the basement so no one heard us. He's my neighbor so it wasn't difficult for him to get to my house. Once we were together and alone he took it phone and told me I was allowed to go on it. This gave me a weird vibe but I just went along with it. He started touching my leg and scooting closer to me and tried to kiss me. I was visibly uncomfortable but he kissed me anyway. Then he started grabbing my chest, and I hadn't even said a word at this point, and he asked if it was okay and I said no. He kept trying to touch my chest and I continued to say no and he eventually gave up. We were just making out for a little bit until he put his hand on my vagina through my pants and I was just sitting there in shock. I kept trying to move away, but he didn't let me. He continued to touch me. This when on for about an hour until he had to leave. He didn’t talk to me for a couple months after that. But he has tired to more recently. Whenever he sees me in the neighborhood he waves and i just look away. I know that he knows what he did, but I think he’s in denial. I still think about it. I'm so scared to talk about it so I just keep it to myself and sit in silence because I know I'll be blamed for everything.",,
"I’ve never told anyone before but I think about it all the time. In year 8 I was in a cookery class with all boys (about 7 of them). The boy I was partnered with would always try to touch me to annoy me. I always told him to stop and moved away. One day he grabbed my bum and joked about it with the other boys. The worst part is that most of them weren’t even his friends and yet they all laughed at me and made me feel embarrassed so I never said anything. Now I kick myself about it - please if this kind of thing happens to you don’t be afraid to speak up."",I sort help through the uni but the person i saw told me not to say his name as I wouldnt want it to go further.,As a result i have suffered depression, ocd and anxiety.,All of this has been set off again as he has just done a charity challenge for mental health.

I was groped during class by several boys the teacher noticed but smirked and ignored me...,,
There was a male PE teacher at my school for 11-14 year-olds who was infamous for walking into the girls changing rooms unannounced.,,
I never thought much of it but once I was at a mates house with about six of us and this one guy had said he wanted to get with me. I wasn’t really into but then when we started playing spin the bottle he was really into it. Later we were sitting on the sofa and he kept putting his arms round me and trying to put his hand down my pant even though I kept removing him. It was even worse when u saw people talking about it on the other sofa as if I was into it when he wouldn’t leave me alone. Everyone thought I got with him after he told them all.,,
"I’m not sure if this counts but me and other girls in my school have been touched inappropriately by boys and also called derogatory names such as a slag, slut and whore.",,
"I was 14 when I first was asked for nudes. As a girl who had never experienced what it was like to have male attention, and who didn’t understand the difference between a guy liking you and a guy using you, I was a perfect candidate for boys to try and receive unsolicited pictures from. It’s started with just one guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] telling me how fit I was, saying how he thought I looked really hot and used all the heart emojis and missy face emojis which convinced me that he really did think this. He started becoming more and more full on with the comments about my body and started convincing me that the only way to “prove” how fit,sexy,hot I was, was to send him my entire body. I said no at first then he sent me pictures of himself telling me that he had sent so now I HAVE to, saying that it’s wrong and unfair for me not to send. Then he started using derogatory words and insults to further pressure me into sending him pictures I previously had said no I didn’t want to send. He told me that if I blocked him he would go and tell everyone how much of a slag I am. Eventually I sent to him. After that, I had many, and by many I mean about 30 more boys from the same school and year, [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], asking me for nudes and pressuring me and manipulating me into sending. You would think that it would be easy to just stop talking and to block them, but when these boys tease you with compliments, before shutting you down with insults, you start to do anything to get those compliments back, because who doesn’t want to feel good about them selves even if it is just for a short while. And I know in comparison to other stories out here this is insignificant, but people have to be aware about the utter wrongs that goes on in not only [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but loads of other schools, where boys seem to think that it’s okay to manipulate a girls want for affection to help themselves have a wank in the night. It’s disgusting and utterly ruins the girl, and makes people think that the only way to get a mans attention or the only way to prove that a man likes you is by sexualising your own body. I know so many friends who have gone through the same thing as me especially with [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and who have had a lot worse done to them by [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys. There is a massive rape culture that NEEDS to be sorted out.",,
"""First testimony: Aged 12, met a man on Omegle who was 25. He told me he loved me, but over Skype slowly turned and began to force me to get naked and masturbate on camera. Threatened and blackmailed me, he said he knew where I lived and would come and find me if I didn't do it. Then, once I had done it, took photos of me and said if I didn't continue he would share them all over the Internet. Continued everyday for over a year. ,Second testimony: Told a close friend about this above experience. I cried as I told him. He said I would felt better if I kissed him and went down on him. He made me suck him off as I wept. Age 14 ,Third testimony: A night out in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I went back to this man's house who I worked with (but barely knew). I didn't want to have sex but he convinced me. He refused to wear a condom. He then proceeded to do anal with me, despite me continuously telling him to stop and that it hurt. Aged 19.""",,
He would always put his hand le on my thighs under the table and make advances at me even after i loudly told him no. He’s been doing this for years now,,
Around the age of 12(a 6th grader) I went to a New Years party at my church and I was with a group of kids chilling in a little area ready for sleep. One of my friends older brother(16 and in freshman) started to touch up my leg but we were all so close together I didn’t think anything of it. Then he started to move his hand up on my leg under the blankets. I started to feel really uneasy so I got up and making an excuse. When I got back I moved as far as possible from him. But he moved and got closer to me and started to move his hand back up. I tried to snap one of the people I was close to at the time who was there about it but they just said it was fine. Then later my phone got lost somewhere and couldn’t find it. The worded thing he did my was grab my boob. But after one of his friends asked if I let him finger me. And I feel so bad bc I didn’t say no so I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling this way..,,
I am 19 and was walking past it recently and a group of boys younger than me kicked a football at me then crossed the road to get it and walked behind me then I heard then laughing and whispering about my body then eventually they were shouting about my body. One boy felt me up quickly before they left. Now I have to take a different route to avoid them.,,
"I was sat in class doing maths, my partner put his hand under the table. At first I didn't think much of it, until he grabbed my hand and forced it on his crotch. He then started to touch me, I tried to stop him but i couldn't. I feel so ashamed of myself. It was the worst day ever, now whenever someone puts their hand under the table i get so scared.",,
"I was 11, he was my teacher (probably in his 50s). I was sent out of my lesson to get paper, I was on my way to the AV Room, he was the only other person in the hall. He stopped me and started asking me questions. As he was talking he was getting closer to me until his hands were on me and he started squeezing groping my breasts. I It took me years to realise it was sexual assault. I was ashamed and embarrassed and I told myself I was imagining it.",,
"When I was young, I would sleep on the floor of my room, and he would come in around bed time when we were trying to sleep, he didn't get to my sister, just me, and that's what I am glad for, but he would force me to suck things (his penis) and aswell as stick it in without my consent, I would go pee the next morning and it would burn, and he did this for night apon nights and he would always come back for more and more and more, it wasn't just during nights either, we would play games, and he would always have my siblings do the right thing but had other plans for me, this went on for a span of 2-3 years, I'm hoping my story can help others come forward and and have the confidence to come forward and say what happened.",,
"I was 13, passed out drunk in my friends bed. a boy got in beside me (he was 16), i was half asleep and he started putting his hands on my arse (i thought it was by accident and barely realised what he was trying to do), he kept telling me to turn over but i just lay there and then he flipped me over and shoved his tongue down my throat and at the same time started to take my trackies off. i realised what he was trying to do and started kicking him and telling him to stop. he didn’t. he kept telling me to turn back over and he started touching me everywhere. i finally turned back over and kicked him as hard as i could. he got up and said “why’d you do that we were just having fun”. his friend who’d been sleeping on the sofa on the other side of this room woke up and said did he just try do what i think he did, i said yes, his friend started saying that “he isn’t like that, he’s just drunk, he’s never do that”. he was my friends ex boyfriend and she got mad at me because she still had feelings for him. i’ve never told anyone this and i don’t know what school he went to.",,
I was seeing this guy for a bit and we always smoked when we hung out. One time I was really high at his house and fell asleep. I woke up to him fingering me. Because we were seeing each other at the time I didn’t think I had a right to say anything to him so I just left and never spoke about it again. Only recently did I realise that it was wrong.,,
"I was in my last period of the day and we were watching a video in class which means the lights were off except for 1 lamp. The guy that sat next to me wasn’t in his assigned seat but no one said anything about it, he moved in closer next to me and put his hands in between my thighs close upwards and said it was “warm” and “comfortable”. I didn’t say anything but he was known to “hit on” girls in ways of being touchy which the admin and teachers knew of.",,
We weren’t allowed to wear vests at school from the ages of 11-13 because the male teachers found it uncomfortable ...,,
"at around 12 years old when girls and boys still swam together one of the boys, probably 12-13 years old, would go around and slap the girls bums and when we asked why he was doing that he would say he heard that boys and his (all boys) secondary school had been talking about how girls liked it when boys would slap them. This was at one of the proper swimming clubs in the county and the coaches didn't do anything about it",,
When I was 14 I had a guy message me and he told me he wanted to rape me and make me pregnant. When I was 17 I lost my virginity and the guy told me I wasn’t a virgin because I wasn’t “tight enough”. He then proceeded to call me a whore and a slag and I should be ashamed of myself. Even at uni I am still experiencing harassment from locals who drive into campus and catcall girls.,,
"This year something terrible happened to my friend and I. We go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]l. And one of the students intimidated us to the point where we said yes to her touching us and even when my friend didn’t consent she still did it to them. When she was confronted she denied everything and even with the voices of two students the school still believed her side of the story. It’s shocking, disgusting and disturbing to think that someone could get away with causing others so much pain. And to think that she has no remorse at all and she could possibly do it to another student scares me.",,
"I am a guy. When I was 17 I was coming home from my summer job on a train. A girl who was clearly very intoxicated sat down next to me and was talking to me. I chatted with her to be polite but she kept trying to touch my arms and my legs. After a few minutes she tried to kiss me, she kept trying even after I pushed her away, the only reason she couldn’t was because the baseball cap I was wearing stopped her face before she could kiss me. It was really disturbing and I can only imagine how scary that would have been if I had been a girl and she had been a boy that was a lot stronger than me.",,
"I was out with friends for a guy friends b-day I was 16 he had just turned 18. His boss was there. I was drinking (underage) his boss kept buying me strong drinks and making sure I drank them. I was so drunk I could hardly walk he took me in a taxi home and my friends let him. He raped me all night. I was in and out of consciousness. He bathed me in the bath he bathed his son in (his wife and 3 yr old son were away) I remember the sticky letter sponges on the tiles that his son would have played with then I looked down and the bath water was red from him raping me vaginally/anally. He carried me to the bed and I passed out. The next day I woke up and had to wait for him to wake up bc we were in a village and my phone was dead. I remember getting up with dried blood between my legs (even after he bathed me) so sore I could hardly move, I couldn’t pee without crying for days because the tears down there. He woke up and thanked me for ‘the fun night’ and he drove me to the next town. I remember telling him I was too drunk and didn’t want to do it. He ignored me. All my friends thought we fucked. I didn’t have the courage to tell them he raped me. I didn’t want to ruin his family and reputation. I should have stood up for myself afterwards but I was so scared and ashamed.",,
"he was my boyfriend. i was 14. we had a playful relationship with boundaries but he was emotional immature and was essentially embarrassed to be with me. one time we were hanging out alone, he wanted to push further. i didnt want to and told him i didnt at the time. he sulked, moped, moaned and insisted until i gave in. i didnt want to, but i wanted him to be happy. i can barely remember what happened because i repressed it so much. i didnt even realise i was coerced until recently thinking about it. i hate it.",,
"I went over to a guy's house to help me with my Philosophy homework. Because I'd heard all of these stories, I got him to promise he wouldn't sleep with me or anything when I was there. He said fine as long as I didn't steal anything from me (I obviously wouldn't). So we had a really salty dinner and went to bed. I woke up in the night and was really thirsty and there was a jug of water by my bed so I drank from it. When he came in the next morning, he saw I'd drunk from the jug and said I'd stolen from him so he was released from his promise. He then undressed and had sex with me",,
"i sit next to this girl in like 3 or my classes who asked me out once and me being straight, politely turned her down. since then, shes constantly touching and me and bringing her hand closer and closer to my crotch (we wear skorts on pe days) so its not even like ita over material - its on my skin. she also will walk past me occasionally and jus stroke or do something to my breasts. shes constantly messaging me and sexualising me aswell",,
He was my teacher and took advantage of me.,,
"I was 17 and had just come out as bi and non binary and went to a party. I had gotten some rude comments and people talking about me but didn’t think anything of it till I was about to leave and a boy came up to me and said he wanted to ask me something. He took me outside and started touching me and trying to take my trousers off saying that there was a bet if one the boys could ‘make me normal’. He raped me and laughed while doing it, saying no one would believe me if I told anyone and to this day I haven’t been able to talk about it.",,
Me and my ex best friend had a falling out. 6 months later my nudes got leaked. i later on found out it was her who leaked my nudes.,,
"When I moved in with my dad at the start of March I had lost most of my friends so I wanted some attention and started sending nudes to boys. I explained to one of the boys how I use it as a distraction from what was going on and he told me to “stay distracted” because he was only using me for nudes. Time passed and I had sent to a few more boys, in the moment I loved the attention, but afterwards I always felt disgusting. It turns out one of the guys screen shotted my nudes without me knowing. He started sending it around to people with my @ and saying i’m “easy” and that I “send nudes to everyone”, it made me sick. I started getting messages from various boys telling me what was going on, but no one would say who shared them originally. I had no idea what to do and I didn’t want my parents to find out. I never got them stopped and I still don’t add new people who add me by search incase they have seen them. I started talking to a new boy because he lives near my mum, so it would be easy to see him. He started asking me for nudes and I wanted him to like me so I gave in and sent. Afterwards I felt so guilty and disgusted in myself I blocked him and relapsed.",,
"I was 15 at a party where I had had to much to drink and I was just talking to a boy. He took me upstairs because I wanted to lie down and he started really aggressively fingering me, I tried to get him to stop but he wouldn’t. I know at some point during this someone walked in but I couldn’t even speak I was so drunk. Then I somehow came up with an idea that if I offered him a hand job he would have to stop, so I did and he agreed. Halfway through giving him a hand job I passed out in his bed and when I woke up there was cum on me and he was gone. I was completely naked. The next day I was at school and everyone had heard about it and laughed at me because I passed out, the people at his school also joked about it and it still haunts me to this day. He makes me feel so gross I want to vomit when I see him. I suffered so much humiliation and shame from this and no one seemed to realise that they where laughing at me because I passed out. Surely that alone means I wasn’t even in a place to give consent?",,
When I was young someone I knew would sexually assault me every day but it stopped after a few days I was only 8 :(,,
"I think we often blatantly overlook the role that single sex girls schools play in this. I would often be chastised by female teachers for showing clevage, simply because the objectively see-through school shirts of our uniform didnt come in a size that fit me without undoing my top button and I would be asked what boys in my school of all girls I was trying to impress. If I wore a brightly coloured sports bra so that my shirt fit I'd be told off for showing my underwear. Similar incidents occured to me and other students where female teachers (most no longer at the school) would ask what boys or male teachers we were trying to impress by literally wearing regulation uniform, further aiding the idea that women are responsible for the sexualisation of their bodies. Our year 7,8 and 9 PSHE teaches that assault is bad, consent is saying yes clearly and how to use a condom. Then its over. But its those early years where teachers, often female teachers reinforce the idea that your body is a sexual object and this translates to the feeling of responsibility that prevents reporting.,I distinctly remeber such comments being made abt going to impress the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with my cleavge or whatever coming from female teachers, which left me feeling incredibly low abt a part of my body I had no control over and hence I wld dress for it, only to have my bum and breasts grabbed outside [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] station after a gig, leading me to react in the exact opposite way and yet I still get catcalled constantly when literally wearing trackies and a tshirt on a journey to school. I don't think I will ever escape its impacts and I really belive the culture in girls schools relating to their male counterpart institutions is a key part of the trauma.",,
"He has a history of getting with every girl possible, and even some distant rape claims. They were kept secret. He was a fun friend, and I already set up my boundaries and told him I wouldn’t be with him. I thought this would be enough, if I kept denying him then he would understand. I was wrong. One night at 12am he texts me that he’s back from California, and to come outside. We’re catching up for a few minutes in my driveway and all of a sudden he just picks me up and puts me in his lap. I tried moving away and he told me to “chill out” and he’s not even going to do anything. Eventually, he puts his hands up my shirt and basically removed my hoodie at that point. This made me very uncomfortable, as we were facing my neighbors houses. I tried to move but he wouldn’t let me go, so I just waited for it to be over and stared at the stars.",,
i’ve been multiply touched in inappropriate places without consent multiple times and shouted at if i argue with it,,
"I was only 14. We were laying down watching a movie and he began to place his hands on my lower stomach. I didn't know what to do because I felt it would be awkward to point it out if he wasn't actively doing anything. I convinced myself it was nothing. It would lead to nothing. As the time progressed he placed his hands lower and lower until he began rubbing me through my jeans. I was shocked. I was supposed to trust this man. I had trusted this man. I felt frozen, I couldn't move. I feared pointing anything out in case he would get mad and hurt me again. I haven't told anyone. I'm too ashamed of how I didn't do anything in the moment. It hurts.",,
"I was in an extremely on and off thing with a guy for about a year and a half during GCSEs. Back then it wasn’t abuse to me, but I felt stuck, depressed and self harmed and didn’t see it clearly. The sexual violence and emotional abuse started about 6 months before I ended it. He would choke me so hard that it left bruises wrapped around my neck, which I never showed him, I still can’t think why, but I have kept the photos ever since as a way of healing. He would also bite my lip so hard that I would scream ouch and please stop but I was told I was a pussy and to get over it. I thought it was just him being freaky and this was what ‘freaky’ is. He also told me daily that he wanted to ‘hit me so hard’ because it turned him on. When I was at his house with his boys, on numerous occasions he said in front of ALL OF US while they were banging drugs, I’ll give her more to get her even more fucked so she’s better/ more freaky in bed (or something along those lines) even though I hadn’t even tried those drugs before (and didn’t do them, but was influenced into getting drunk to be on their level) . All through this year period I cried, but when I eventually broke it off during lower sixth, I didn’t cry once and felt such a power over him and felt like an actual weight had been lifted off me. He apologised for everything he had done to hurt me but it was just another level to his manipulation which I wasn’t falling for. Only 2 or 3 people know about it to this day but I’m able to talk about it now without it being upsetting, more as a way of making him look like the dickhead he is.",,
"One boy would systematically get girls drunk at parties, remain completely sober himself, and then get with them. He’d often take them to his car even when they were clearly WAY too drunk to be doing anything remotely sexual. He remained 100% sober and it was incredibly calculated. He did it to me, we made out and touched a bit. He bragged to everyone that I sucked him off afterwards, even though I was visibly blackout and could barely string a sentence together or walk let alone suck a dick. I was too drunk to consent to any of it, and the fact that everybody at the school saw how drunk I was that night, and said nothing when they heard I supposedly gave him head, is just another example of how rape culture is perpetuated.",,
"""i'm 16, it was [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] me and my ex boyfriend (18) had began speaking again after a year of being split up. i quickly realised i didn't want to be together with him again, but reassured him i would always be there for him as he struggles with mental health issues badly. (TW) we both were at a party that night and i was rather drunk when i came home, i received a call from him that he was down at a river near my house that he was going to commit suicide , he begged me to come down to see him, as i promised i would always be there for him i went down to see him. i was petrified that i would in some way feel blamed if he done anything to himself. He be began kissing me and feeling me inappropriately, i told him that's not what i was here for, and he didn't stop. i began to get visibly upset and he said if i do it he wouldn't kill himself, i didn't want to do it but i felt as if his life would be on me if i didn't do what he wanted. i continued to tell him i'd come out another day and do anything he wanted but not tonight. he pushed me against the river wall banking and pulled down my trousers. i silently cried the whole time. he realised what he done after and tried to reassure me i wanted it, i couldn't even speak. i walked home in the dark fields feeling disgusting because of what another man done to me. not until recently have i realised what he done to me was wrong and i am not to blame. i don't understand how someone who said they loved and care about me deeply hurt me so bad.",,
"i have been touched, filmed, shouted at, whistled at all at this school without consent and i know it might not be seen as “bad” but i know other girls/ boys will have had the same or worse so i want to encourage them to speak up.",,
A teacher made me touch his inner thighs,,
"i was assaulted on school grounds , i had just walked away from a teacher when a boy , only a year older than me groped me , his friend then did the same , i was petrified i didn’t know what to do and i was terrified , i didn’t turn round i didn’t do anything i just walked as fast as i could . i heard them LAUGHING at me as i walked as fast as i could , it felt suffocating , nothing happened and i had to go to school everyday for the next 3 years until they left and see their faces , in my head i could hear the laughs . today - they left school today and i’ve never been more grateful",,
"This was a while back but when I was in 3rd form we would have ‘discos’ with the 4th and 5th form. I remember being completely new to the school, only had just settled in- I was 13. A boy in 5th form groped me twice and so did his friend, and then another boy who was completely off his head tried to finger me, he was in 5th form, i was in 3rd from. He was turning 16, i had just turned 13.At the time i remember being so uncomfortable i left the disco, but afterwards i tried not to think much about it, don’t think i told anyone because i thought if people found out it would be blamed on me and because they were popular it would essentially ruin my rep. I was 13, i had only just had my first kiss and now boys were touching me in places that i did not want to touched. It affected me a lot because it almost made me think that this was normal and i should just accept that older boys and men would treat me in such a way as i grew up. It’s disgusting honestly, if you are a man reading this, educate yourself, listen to peoples accounts of harassment and always believe them. It scares me to think things like this still happen at let alone fettes but other private schools in the uk. This needs to change.",,
When I was 12 in a science lesson a boy stabbed my bottom with a pencil. I screamed and the school took it seriously and gave him a headmaster’s detention. The worst part was that all his friends bullied me afterwards saying that i deserved it and was just trying to get him into trouble.,,
"my sister invited me with the warning “don’t talk to the guys” because she was afraid they would try to get with me. i thought she was insane considering i am a literal child but i kept it in the back of my mind. i put on my favorite party dress and wore the necklace my mom gave to me. at the party i saw him. he was one of the only people i knew, one of the people i knew i could trust, or so i thought. he kept saying “forget about your sister” “let loose” “just one more drink” but one more drink ended up being 6 and me basically passed out on his shoulder. i felt his cold fingers lace through my hair and down my neck and his lips on my cheek. i heard him whispering in my ear “i guess we have a secret now” i wanted it to stop but before i could say anything his tongue was down my throat and his hands were holding me a little too tight around my waist . i tried pulling away but he wouldn’t let go and i was far too drunk to force him off of me. as he was rubbing my legs a group of other boys walked over and he immediately through me to the side. i was so confused and tired but i heard muffled sounds of “who’s the hoe” and “damn you’ve got bitches.” i don’t know where i got the strength from but i stood up and walked away and even though it didn’t go any further it still eats me up inside, months later. he was my sisters best friend and i didn’t want to tell her because i didn’t want to start drama but i did anyways. i broke down in the middle of the hallways the next week in school and i had to explain everything to the guidance counselor. i didn’t even know what i wanted to do and suddenly they were talking about legal stuff because i’m only 14 and he’s almost 19 and i didn’t know what i wanted. they called my mom and she made all the decisions for me and the whole situation just made me feel like a rag doll that people love to throw around. i felt like a slut and i lie awake at night remembering that he’s the last person i’ve kissed. actually the first and probably only time i’ll kiss a boy. i’m a lesbian and yet he goes around telling people that i led him on. he’s in college in japan now and i’m just now starting highschool and i’m scared that his friends might know or the teachers and i’m so scared of being judged. at the same time it’s not like i was raped so i feel like i’m not even allowed to be upset about it.",,
I had been sexually harassed a few months prior. I finally decided to tell a teacher as it was bothering me a lot and they said I was overthinking it and that they probably ‘were in a bad head space’ when they did it to me. I’d gone to the teachers for help and instead I was overlooked multiple times for sexual harassment,,
When I was 11-12 until about 15 I was sexually abused over the internet. I had met a man on Omegle and chatted on Kik. He told me he was 16 and he verbally abused me for years. He threatened to post my nudes and used them against me. I later found out he was 36 by being investigated by the cops and there was nothing they could do. He took so much from me over the phone and prayed on me at such a young age I didn’t know better. After him I didn’t love my self or know how a man was supposed to love me and ended up losing my virginity at 14. I was alone. In high school any guy that was with me would use me for sex and I didn’t know better. I am still trying to learn to love my self and find the right love from someone. I’m more than just my body!,,
"I lost my virginity at 15 to an 18 year old “friend” who offered to walk me back to his as a safe place because I was far too drunk to be out around other people. I agreed to the sex but he was sober and definitely took advantage of me literally being in and out of consciousness and knew full well I wasn’t in the right mind to agree to anything. I’ve never said anything for fear of not being believed, and that he’s normally a “nice guy” and is it even fair for me to out him...",,
"I was 6-8 at that time, probably in first grade. My cousin’s step brother, who was 13-15 at that time, usually would come by at our house, since my cousin lives with us and his house was just 2 blocks away, my parents was okay with him coming inside the house and play with us or either babysit us. My father was working abroad and my mother had work at that time, so they asked him to babysit us (my little brother, me, and my cousin), and of course he agreed...it was probably 4 in the afternoon, my brother has his afternoon nap along with my cousin. I didn’t feel like sleeping at that time so I played with my teddy bears in the living room. He suddenly joined in and I didn’t mind at that time since I was just a kid. “Do you know what happens if two people love each other?” He suddenly asked. It was a weird question to ask a 7 year-old girl. I didn’t answer and proceed to play with the teddy bears. I had a lot of teddy bears at that time so he took two and started making them kiss. “They kiss because they love each other” ....at the time I knew what a kiss was since I loved watching barbie films and romance movies. “Do you love me?” He asked again it was a very weird question for a kid and I didn’t really know what love meant so I just nodded. Big mistake. He began making the teddy bears kiss again and then kissing me. He stopped “then we love each other, kiss me” i kissed him in the lips since I was afraid/uncomfortable to say no. The next week, as usual he comes by at our house and babysit us, all of us were playing hide and seek, he was the seeker, and we (who were kids) hid in different places. I hid in a room where we don’t really use and waited...he caught me...I laughed because I lost but he started to close the door and pull his pants down and danced like crazy and I didn’t know what to do so I closed my eyes in hopes he would go away. He did go away. To this day I still don’t know wether if it was my fault or his. I still don’t know if it was either sexual assault since I kissed him...but I was just a kid.",,
"a guy who i was talking to in the year above would always ask me for nudes when i clearly stated that i wasnt comfortable sending anything. he also used to call me overweight and would make jokes about me bringing down a plane because i was so fat, and then when i said i wouldn't talk to him anymore he would say that he made these awful comments because he was 'nervous' and didn't know how to act around girls",,
I was emotionally and sexually abused by two girls in my dorm; the school did nothing.,,
"Girls at a mixed gender sixth form where only boys attended until Y12 where encouraged to participate in a slave auction for charity. Large numbers of jeering boys watching dressed up girls on stage and bidding for them. The girls were in a minority and only teenagers. Also, pastoral care for the sixth form girls forming coercive relationships was appalling if not completely absent.",,
He grabbed and touched my vagina.,,
"When I was in year 10 (14) I innocently saw a boy from another [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] school, I was very naive. Long story short one thing led to another and he asked to have sex with me. I said no because I wasn’t sure yet and I didn’t know him or trust enough so I would regret it but I admit I probably wasn’t stern enough. He would not stop begging me and eventually I felt I had to give in (he tricked me into thinking his penis was his hand during this). He then told the entire school, whilst he was congratulated I was badly slut shamed. No one cared to ask if I was even okay. I was and still am left humiliated by the thought and the worst part is I don’t believe this boy is a bad person I think he was just not educated in boundaries and used his ‘charm’ as a way of manipulation even if he did not recognise it.",,
I was 13 (just started 6th grade) he was 18(about the graduate) on the bus this guy wanted to be friends or so I thought. I never gave him any information about where I lived or any social media I had yet he found out my number and snap and everything..should have saw that as a red flag but didn’t after a week of talking he would want to do stuff to me.. I would wear so much clothing so he couldn’t but it didn’t stop him…I didn’t tell anyone till 2 years later and when I did they said it wasn’t his first time doing that to girls my age,,
"when i was 14 i went on an anonoumys chat site. i had gone on therapy type texting ones before and behaved alot more mildly (sexting etc.). and at that time i was beginning to feel more sexual in myself, and i honestly don't know what i was looking for, but the first person i met a black screen came up and they asked me to do things for points; blowing kisses, waving, flashing, putting my elbows together, masturbating; i knew it felt wrong but i had no idea of the dangers. after a while they showed me they had screenrecorded the whole thing and to get them not to release it anywhere i had to do one final thing; my heart sunk, now i knew whatvever 'it' was wouldnt stop them, so i panicked and left the chatroom. i dont know where that video is and dont need to. but to this day ive only told one person, i couldnt even tell my mum all of it, but the terror and guilt it left me with have shaped me as person. i was convinced my phone was bugged, every cold caller was to talk to me about it, i felt so so dirty, i was so young and oblivious. i dont think about it much anymore and to be honest it bothers me much less, but i was groomed, i didnt consent, i couldnt have, that person is a monster and im sorry to anyone else who is or has been effected by them. but every now and then the panic it brought me rises up along with everything else, i am not often comfortable with my body sexually anymore. i saw a tiktok of a girl making a joke about the same thing happening to her and lots of girls commenting they had experienced it too, which was a comfort at least. anway it makes me think about how internet safety nowadays is taught so unrelevantly, it needs stepping up for the real world to make young people and all people aware of the actual reality of sharing personally online; because you cant stop people from doing it, and it doesnt have to be traumatic. thankyou for listening.",,
I don’t know where to start. My friends knocked on my door And I was ready for school we started to walk and my phone rang it was a instagram call. I answered it. Because I thought nothing of it at the time and me and my friends saw a guy masterbating. You are probably wondering why/how I got myself in to this so I was on Instagram and I went on to one of my friends instagrams and followed back people from school so I I followed back the account. This has been delt with by the police but I wanted to share,,
This student tried to take pictures of up girls skirts and the only thing that happened was he got excluded for a couple weeks but he came right back to school right after,,
Someone came up to me during school in the hallway and tried to touch me i ran,,
"my boyfriend at the time always spoke about sex even within the first week and i always told him i was uncomfortable. after a month, at his house he was kissing me but moved himself on top of me so i couldn’t move away, he continued to try to take my underwear off as i was struggling to move my mouth to say no- this lasted a minute until i managed to shout no. i left his house and he dumped me after. I went to school and everyone had heard about it and how i was frigid and gross- the school never did anything nor did any of my friends. ive brushed it off as he did stop but it still makes me feel horrible about myself.",,
"My misogynistic ex husband, who abused myself and my children, including not taking no for an answer from me, has applied to the Family Court for child contact. During proceedings he has been reported for rape by someone else, which is wholey believable. I am told this will not stop him from getting child contact, although it will weigh heavier than if I had alleged it. How is it acceptable for my children to be made to spend time with and be influenced by, an abuser, a rapist, a woman hater? What does this tell my daughter about being helpless as a girl/woman, and my son about attitudes towards women?",,
"I started at a new sixth form, where people had already heard of a “reputation” of mine, that I was a slut basically. I was an attention seeking, lying slut, who cried rape because I couldn’t take regrets. So I’ve started this sixth form, and instantly I have guys asking if because I’m “easy”, will I take their virginities, and will I do stuff with them in the bathrooms. I’d walk down a hallway and have people literally mutter “whore” under their breath, believing I wouldn’t hear. I dated someone for three weeks, and it only lasted for three weeks because his friends couldn’t stand him dating ME. His friends all sent me extremely inappropriate messages, which he is unaware of, asking how far we’d gone and if I’d go further with them, and how they’d make me or tell him I’d sent them “pictures”. We ended up breaking up after an argument about my ex, who assaulted me repeatedly, where his friends told me I was a slut and wouldn’t respect him if he got back with me, or even stayed friends with me. This carried on, and only got worse to the point where I’d wear a skirt or skinny jeans to school, and my thigh gap got commented on to the point where I deliberately stopped exercising and eating more crappy food to get rid of it, especially when one guy balled up his fist to see if he could fit it in between my thighs under a table. When I tried speaking about it, I’d already been painted as a “liar”, simply because of claims I’d made strongly about my ex who raped me, and people were friends with him. Nobody would listen, and I was alone. There was a school trip to New York, which I went on. Whilst I was on the coach, I got a message saying how much one of the boys wished he could’ve gone and shared a room with me, just so he could get some “hot, sleeping arse”. He vividly described what he’d do to me once I fell asleep, which tainted the trip. Lockdown obviously happened, and I was the end of several jokes - people would screenshot pictures off my Instagram, zoom in on my cleavage and rate it, saying what they’d like to do. I knew I couldn’t carry on in this year group, and so I petitioned my school to drop a year group, to bring my grades up. But I was truly in fear that something could actually happen to me if I stayed.",,
I was in 7th grade. Sitting in math. A guy said that tomorrow is national grab a girls butt day and threatened to find me to grab my butt. I was 12.,,
"When i was in year 5/6 people in my year would “date” (the stupid 10yo version at least). This boy was “dating” one of the girls in the year. i was talking to him one day, when he described to me how he was planning to rape his girlfriend while she was sleeping. He was joking about this (as far as i know), but at the age of 10 I was still so shocked. I had only the slightest idea of what rape was at the time. It just goes to show how influenced children are by this toxic culture that surrounds us. That boy was also the first person to grope me without consent. I felt awful and embarrassed about it for a very long time. My primary school was full of boys harassing girls, whether physically or verbally, including saying the most inappropriate, sexual things about them in front of them or behind their backs. I personally felt very uncomfortable around lots of the boys in our year once I reached puberty. It’s awful to think that this sort of behaviour was happening from the age of 9, but at the time it was completely accepted and laughed off by the girls. Education about this sort of harassment needs to happen earlier, as the mindset of being entitled to women’s bodies is ingrained in boys at such a young age. School never saw this behaviour as a problem or taught us anything meaningful about harassment and this probably contributed to the problem.",,
"When I was 15, my friend offered me an uber home after a party. I agreed and although I was very drunk, I trusted him. In the uber, we made out a bit which we had done before. About 5 minutes later, his hands were in my pants and I was really uncomfortable. I didn’t want to cause a scene with the driver, so I just whispered repeatedly asking him to stop. Afterwards he claimed he didn’t hear anything, but when told that I kept asking him to stop he said that “she was fucking whispering”, which means that he did hear me. He tried to play the victim, threatened to kill himself, and advised me against getting that drunk again. I haven’t even told this to some of my closest friends because I don’t want people to view me differently for it.",,
stuck in the mens toilet with a boy and he would let me leave until i kissed him,,
"I went to an independent school 30 years ago, similar to many of the institutions named in these testimonies. In my ignorance I thought things had changed. I am utterly devastated to hear they have not. That young women are subjected to the same abuse and misogyny that has haunted my peers and I for decades.",,
"There’s a really toxic culture that protects a male member of staff. He has slept with BTEC students and staff. I feel uncomfortable whenever he is around, my friends do too",,
"When I was younger, maybe about 8? My class and I were watching finding nemo, all sitting together on the carpet, when a boy sitting behind me decided to stick his hand down my underwear and started to touch my arse and anus. I was mortified and still too young to fully understand, all I knew was that I was so uncomfortable. I tried to shuffle away from him but he kept coming closer. To this day I still regret not saying anything even though I know I genuinely froze up and couldn’t even speak.",,
"I was seeing this boy who i had met online years before and he started off as my best friend. we finally met and it turned into more because we both realised we had feelings for each other. everything started out amazing and i was as happy as i could be until he started acting like i was his property and an object. he was so toxic and made me cut off friends and do things that i didn't want. he started forcing me to do anal which i didn't enjoy nor like but i allowed him because i was blind to this shit because i thought i was in love with him. at the time i was only 17 and he was nearly 20. he started talking about kids which i was definitely not ready for and didn't want whatsoever and it got to a point where he refused to pull out. after 4-5 months of being with him i accidentally fell pregnant and I already knew then i didn't want to have the child, yet he sat there and tried manipulating and guilt tripping me into having it. and after I went through that struggle he tried to do it all over again. it haunted me for months and months and will for the rest of my life and im still not over it and petrified to start seeing someone new.",,
"this is obviously very minor compared to other girls testimonies but it still affected me quite a lot. I went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and to get to school I’d have to walk over [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] every day at the same time as the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys were walking the other way. I was seeing a guy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and every day his mates would harass me, ‘knock’ into me, yell my name and other derogatory terms etc. I ended up changing my entire daily routine just to avoid it. I woke up earlier and left school later so I could be sure I wouldn’t see them. At the time I thought it was just an inconvenience but looking back I really changed my whole daily routine because too many boys have no manners. I never told the guy whose mates it was because I thought it was embarrassing and that he’d never believe me.",,
I use to have panic attacks when on my period because the blood would remind me of what happened. I ended up having to go on contraception to stop my periods.,,
I was on the [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] for my first motive. I was drunk and this guy started talking to me. He started kissing me and asked if we wanted to go somewhere more private. He made me feel wanted. I said yes and we went off. He asked to go down on me and I was drunk and blacking out. I couldn’t believe that someone liked me so I felt obliged to nod. It was my first sexual experience I thought that this was normal - what you had to do. I felt uncomfortable but didn’t say anything. I went home and tried to forget about most of that night. He started snapping me and seemed genuinely interested in me. I was coerced into meeting him again. He started kissing me and I kept pulling back and saying no but he thought I was just teasing him. He then forced his dick into my mouth and made me give him head. I said no and hated it to the point where I was lying on the ground paralysed and he was still pushing it in my mouth. After he finished he said that he had to go home and left. I still thought stupidly that he liked me and that this was what “linking” meant. Turns out he was on things with someone else during all of this and had sexually offended other girls. I then got slut shamed and bullied by other highgate boys. Everyone at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] knew. Random boys I never heard of were talking about my body talking about what I did and messaging me saying “come fuck me at the [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]” “ur such a slut” “is it true he ate you out” I never knew this was wrong until a year later. I still feel disgusted in my own skin. I was 14.,,
Idk if this counts or not and I’m sorry to anybody that has had worse but in 5th grade I was on the bud with a guy who idk ig he liked me and he can and sat next to me at the time I was not comfortable with swearing but I told him to F off he black mailed me saying he would tell my mom if I didn’t do what he asked so he then proceeded to push me up against the window and kiss me I was very uncomfortable and got out of there ASAP we eventually moved away and I haven’t seen him since but it still terrifies me to this day,,
"A boy I was friends with shoved his hand down my school dress and gripped my chest. We were stood with all of our friends during lunchtime. He then proceeded to tell me he was ""sorry I took it that way""",,
"We had problems with a handful of teenage girls whose promiscuity caused a problem and safety issues for other girls in our local area. The would often have sex in the local nature reserve near the school. The school did nothing to expel the girls and social services did nothing to have them removed from their families and the local area. The reason this became a problem is that once the boys had finished with them sexually the boys became a nuisance and a danger to ordinary school girls who did not sleep about because sleeping about was normalised to them. The boys then viewed all girls as slags. It's not known if the girls had been abused within their own families before they became promiscuous the fact that nothing was done to protect other people from their behaviour is completely negligent on behalf of the school and the local authorities. One of the girls reputedly went to a party and had sex with four boys at it, she still walks around my town to this day. Another one of the girls I remember arguing in the street with one of her ex boyfriends about having sex with a waiter on holiday. A third girl was reputed to have had multiple abortions from the age of 14.",,
I was on the bus on day and a boy in my year tried to go down my school whilst I was saying no then when he did I then proceeded to try and finger me but that this point I grabbed his hand to stop him . When the school found out about it he got away with it and didn’t get punished one single bit . It was not the first time he had done this to me either,,
"last year, on a walk back home, I was almost abducted by someone. he started touching me, I didn't know what to do. i never told except my last partner and my current one and they've helped me a lot through getting over it.",,
"I became close friends to a boy in my A level Sociology class and we began to flirt online and in class we would move to sit next to each other. I was sat with him in the study room (another female was in the room). He came up behind me and grabbed my chest out of no where, but positioned himself so she couldn’t see. I then said I have to leave feeling very uncomfortable and beginning to get upset. He then asked me for a hug and pulled me in and grabbed my behind. He never spoke to me after that and I proceeded to cry with my friends. All of this would’ve been caught on CCTV in the sixth form.",,
"I was in year 5. I was doing my work as usual, in English class. The guy that sat next to me kept touching my leg. He then went under the table and was lifting my skirt. I was trying to hit him to get him to stop without bringing attention to myself but it wouldn't work. He lifted my skirt, pulled my underwear to the side and touched me. I was just sitting, silently crying. I didn't want to bring attention to myself. I didn't want to have to tell someone. I didn't want to have to go through it.",,
I was merely walking along [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] aged 14 with a friend on a Sat. afternoon and a man approached moving quickly grabbed me between the legs and ran off. I shouted loudly “ Did you see what HE did !!” It was awful.,,
"I was manipulated into taking nude photos of myself by a man i met on snapchat who said he was 19, i lied about my age and said i was a couple years older than what i actually was (it was still underage). soon without even noticing what i was doing i sent him some he made me feel better about myself and complimented me a lot so i kept sending since i had that desire to be/feel loved by someone. later on i would go through some deep sh** with some friends and would have my nudes exposed by them....when i asked them why they did it they said “because it’s funny”. now i’m scared to even respond to a single snapchat by anyone and scared to go to school",,
So there was these 3 year 10 boys just hanging around the corridor and I was making my way to class and one of the boys whistled and called my name out and one grabbed my ass and was touching it up as I walked pass. I was so shocked no words came out my mouth and I'm normally that type of girl who would talk back and tell them that they were wrong but I just couldn't and as I walked down the stairs the last one called my name and asked me to sit on my lap as the rest laughed. I felt soo shocked because I would never have thought that this would happen to me.,,
I made friends with a boy from college and one of our mutual friends was having a party I was groped by this boy multiple times I didn’t consent to being touched like that and I told him to stop. I was too afraid to tell anyone because I didn’t think it was as serious as other stories I had heard,,
"When I was 16 I hated dated this guy in my school i had a comfort thing that i would like people that i trusted hold my thigh and I'd hold theirs, one day the person I was dating moved his hand up and groped me I said No and he said his hands were cold, we were sitting right next to my best friend. I had spoke to him on why I was uncomfortable with it and he said I asked him why and didnt tell him no.",,
I was a victim of domestic violence by my ex fiancè for months. I have just gone through a trail where he eventually pleaded guilty. It looks like he will only get a community order. I fear that one day if notvstopped he will kill someone.,,
"i was 13 he was 14 he was a mutual friend and he complimented me and made me feel wanted while i was struggling at the height of an eating disorder, he pressured me into sending him nudes and i did it he then pressured me to meet up with him where he assaulted me it wasn’t as bad as it could be but i’ve never recovered from it i’ve had to block so many people on instagram because they are friends with him and everytime i see his face i have day long panic attacks and spiral , what makes it worse is someone i used to be very close friends with knows exactly what he did to me and has chosen to become friends with him since this is the same girl who preaches about feminism and believing victims .",,
"I had a long term boyfriend (i was in 14) from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] he constantly asked me to give him head. if we were together he would ask me and i would say no, then he would message me and keep asking. he was close with one of my best friends at the time and would ask her to tell me to give him head. i never gave in, he was my first kiss so it was a new experience for me, and none of my friends had done anything sexual yet so i was scared. he belittled me and made me feel worthless when i sad no making me now scared of relationships. he would finger me without asking, i would let there unable to say no, feeling nothing. and he would tell me to perform oral sex because he had pleasured me.",,
i have been touched but not in the way i would like,,
"Just after I turned 18, i went out to a local club for one of the first times and noticed some much older men behaving strangely to one of my friends. I told them to stop and after doing this, one of the men came over to me and lifted my skirt up to all of his group and groped me. These men looked like my fathers age. I still remember the laughing and apologetic eyes from the other men who stood by and let him do it.",,
"In year 7 (11 years old), a boy forcibly fingered me and also a friend, which was painful and frightening. We knew it was wrong and said to him we didn't like it. We told our parents, who said it was difficult being a teenage boy. We realised adults weren't going to do anything, so one day in school we knocked him over and kicked him. When we were called into our Head Of Year's office to explain our actions, we explained the whole story. She said we shouldn't use violence to settle arguments, and made us apologise to him. Nobody ever punished him, or even explained to him it was wrong. Luckily we had each other to be sure it wasn't just us being drama queens, but every adult around us acted like it was no big deal. It felt lonely, but maybe it was good training for the response of most UK institutions to sexual assault.",,
When i was in school a boy who was about twice my height pinned me up against my lockers and began thrusting against me and wouldn't let me out. Nobody did anything to help. This same boy continued to harass me throughout school and despite me reporting it nothing ever happened to fix it.,,
"I was 14, turning 15 at the time. There was this boy, who I'll call Paul for the sake of my privacy, who was my ""boyfriend"". It started out as consentual. I was interested until he started denying my ""No's"" and ""Please stop"". He would grope me during class. He would sit behind me, slip his hand under my jumper and blouse, and grope my boobs. He would put a vibrator in his sock and make me sit on it. When I'd ask to stop he wouldn't. I was terrified. I was making eye contact with my teacher and I was so ashamed. He didn't stop.",,
i was convinced to go hang out with a guy and was pressured to do an illegal substance and was messed up he then assaulted me while i couldn’t move. please do not do something if you feel it’s a bad idea. always listen to your instincts.,,
a male teacher made the effort to touch me everyday at school and he always told me how beautiful i was.,,
"In middle school (7th-8th grade), i was sexually assaulted by one of my friends, friends. At the time U craved the attention everyone gave me and thought it made me popular. The boys would slap or grab my butt in the hallways and would always ask me for nudes iver text. The kid who started touching me was also the first guy to ask me for nudes. I told him I didn’t do that and i didn’t want to get in trouble or show him anything iver and over again. he wouldn’t leave me alone. He told me he was going to ruin my life and i believed him. he was a bad kid and had friends who could easily hurt me. i just did what he said and tried not to make a big deal. i sent him a booty pic and he sent it around the school. from that day on my life was over. every guy started texting me and asking me for nudes and if i said no, they threaten to send the other picture around and tell other people super bad rumors about me. My friends knew about this and saw the guys always grabbing my butt in class. They told me i should report it to the principal or a teacher. I went down to the office and reported it and they told me it was probably just nothing and said “boys are immature that’s what they do” I was sick of it and the kid got away with it. the next year, i had a close friend group and one of the guys who i thought was my friend, ruined my whole life. He was addicted to porn and a super creepy guy. When we first started “dating” i had been on vacation and he told all my friends that me and him were dating. All my friends texted me and asked me if it was true and i was shocked and texted the kid immediately. I asked him why and he said that he wanted nudes and that he really liked me sk he assumed we were dating and told everyone that. He was diabetic and so when i told my friends i didn’t want to be with him they made me feel like a jerk bc they told me i didn’t wanna date him bc he was diabetic and i felt bad. This kid had forced me to hnagout with him and forced me to pay him and forced everything. I got attached bc he manipulated me. On new year’s eve, (going into 2020) He planned to have sex with me and when all of my friends pushed me into the bathroom where he was i told him i didn’t want to and he forced me to have sex with him. i didn’t tell anyone until August 2020. When I did tel my story, nobody believed me and i lost everyone. not even the school did anything. the police did nothing",,
I was in the school bathrooms doing my thing then a lesbian came in and drugged me and raped me and when I woke up my principal was banging on the bathroom stall,,
There is this boy who goes to my school and was dating/ getting with one of my friends and it was for a few months and he would kind of always pressure her to do things with her such as’ fingering’ and things such as that. One time they were at her house and he attempted to assault her by trying to have sex with her when she specifically said no. He touched a girl in my school without permission under the table sends her inappropriate messages and also sends unsolicited nudes to girls in my school and a lot of girls are very uncomfortable around him.,,
"When i was 17 I mistakenly decided to download Tinder. In doing so, I met up with this guy and we ended up going back to his place. We started kissing and soon I decided I wanted to leave because I wasn’t feeling comfortable. He pressured me into staying and asked me to give him head, after I refused he asked me to has sex with him, in an attempt to be able to use his bus pass to go back home I agreed after saying no multiple times before. I wanted him to use a condom but he didn’t have one but he told me he would be quick. I was young, and only now realised this was a sexually pressured act to lose my virginity to someone I didn’t want to have sex with but felt I should in order to be safe and not be raped or forced into consenting. I remember the embarrassment of having to get the plan b the following day. Two years on I now only realise how fucked that was. Always be safe people x and respect each other because if I knew then what I knew now... This is my first time actually talking about this cause I didn’t even tell my friends about being pressured and now I wish I had spoke up and told them",,
"a boy from my school came round my house one night, he was in year 11 i was in year 9, he repeatedly kissed me on the lips without my consent, then proceeded to touch me inappropriately & pin me onto my bed so i couldn’t get up, he then tried to get his penis out infront of me. when i told my school about it, i felt they didn’t do much. i didn’t even get an apology from him or his parents, he was still allowed round in school.",,
when I was in yr 6 at school I had been cat called by older years because I was wearing leggings. I heard comments like those trousers make me happy and stuff like that.,,
"A misogynistic environment, where the ethos of the whole school was geared towards the boys. In year 8 the boys used to hump us and spank us in class, which the teachers saw and overlooked. In year 9 there were issues with sending nudes which all the boys pressured girls to do, and the schools response was to call a meeting for the girls and talk about why they felt the need to send them (putting the responsibility on us). In year 10 several of my friends older boyfriends forced them into having sex with them, which we only realised and understood years later was rape. Throughout my whole time at this school I was pressured into nudes by older boys, sexual acts by boyfriends, groped, objectified and not one adult said anything about the boys behaviour but instead put it on the girls behaviour. I know so many girls from this school who had much older boyfriends in the school and were sexually abused by boys from this school.",,
My school was such a sexist environment to grow up in where we were told our skirts couldn’t be too short and we couldn’t show our shoulders in case it distracted the boys or male staff. If you were walking up stairs and there was a group of boys behind you it was pretty normal to be groped and we were just told to take it as a compliment. If we tried reporting it to teachers they told us our skirts should be longer and then it wouldn’t happen. This left me with a really unhealthy set of norms and led me to be to disregard sexual harassment from boys at uni and even not to realise I had been raped by friends until years later.,,
"The amount of stories I have from school is ridiculous, and it is only reflecting on them as an adult now that I understand them to be sexual assault, unwanted touch and coercion.,Year 7 geography class, a boy who sat on the table next to mine would, without fail, slap my ass every single time I bent down to put my bag down/pick it up. Every single lesson for a year.,Year 8 standing amongst a group of girls in the playground just chatting, a boy in my year approaches the group, stands opposite me and without having said a word to me reaches across the group and grabs my breasts with both hands in front of everyone. (I was already aware by this time of talk about me across the year because my breasts were significantly larger than most girls at my age),Year 10 being coerced by a boy in my year who I had never spoken to face to face for more than 2 minutes to send a picture of my breasts because ‘it was normal’ and I would be ‘boring’ if I didn’t. The photo was then shared amongst boys in my year and I was constantly approached by ‘popular’ boys taunting me that they had my photo and masturbated over it.,Year 11 being unexpectedly felt up across my thigh and higher by a boy I was sitting next to in class, and just accepting it because I had been to believe by all the past experiences that that was I should give into and that I am only worth my body",,
I had to explain why ignoring a safe word is bad. He got more violent when he was drunk. I was drunk and he used me to please himself.,,
When I was 14 a man who was at least 35 groped me multiple times in Poundland and nobody cared. I told the shopworker and he just shrugged,,
"in 7th grade, a student from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] sexually assulted me. this year, another student from there raped me. i feel so weak, the school does nothing about it. multiple girls have been sexually assaulted in that school or slut shamed.",,
"I was dragged back to a guys flat in freshers week whilst I was blackout drunk. I remember asking him to take me home and him refusing, telling me we were almost at his house. I have flashes of him being on top of me. In the morning I woke up naked in this strangers bed and was so afraid of him seeing me nude I tried to cover myself and I got dressed. I ran out and he followed me, I was still incredibly confused. I went to a lecture that morning and put it to the back of my head for a while.",,
One of the teachers always makes my friends and i feel uncomfortable around him,,
"When I was 16 my boyfriend would try and pressure me into doing things I wasn’t comfortable with in the bedroom, but one day he took it too far and when we were in my bedroom together he forced himself on me and did them without my consent, even when I was shouting at him and trying to push him off me. He didn’t care and it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that someone I cared for so much could do that to me, and even longer to call it rape. To this day I don’t think he knows he did anything wrong because I was in denial about it for longer than we were together. I am still affected mentally by it years later.",,
"It was my first proper boyfriend. We were very young. He would force me to do things that I didn’t want to, like forcing my hand down his pants. I wouldn’t explicitly say no as I was too scared to, but my body language made it perfectly clear. I just want an apology, and for him to recognise that I was not in anyway comfortable, and that his boasting to his friends didn’t help either. It was my first experience of anything intimate, and it makes me feel as if forever that is what it will be like.",,
Teachers always made you feel weird o would always look at me in a weird o sexual way.. I never felt comfortable walking in the hallways because I was afraid something might happen.,,
The boys in my school would always cat call me and lift up my skirt when I walked by. They would whistle at me and shout and scream when I told them to stop doing it. I started wearing shorts and the physical abused me and made me not wear them.,,
"I was with some friends in Hyde park drinking, this boy I had dated for about a week and I went off to talk. We started kissing and doing other things, after a while he put his penis inside of my underwear. I immediately say ‘No, I don’t want it there’, he just replies ‘I’m not going to fuck you I just want to keep it there’. He kept kissing me and pushing me closer to him and his penis was squeezing against me more and more. I kept repeating ‘no, no, no’ and he kept going. I managed to push him off me and thankfully my friends came to find us in that moment and I walked away with them. I didn’t even realise that was assault until 7 months later when I got told the actual definition of it. I didn’t tell anyone for 7 months because I though it was normal and he was just ‘horny’ (as if that’s an excuse), I also didn’t think anyone would believe me. I thought that because we had done other things I had made him horny and that I had made him think it was okay to do that. I thought it was my fault for so many months. This was only the first time something like this happened to me, I am sorry to say that similar things and even worse has happened to me since, multiple times.",,
"I’m a 16 year old girl and I was in a manipulative relationship with this guy, I’m going to tell the whole story sorry if it’s too long and boring. When we started dating it was just before we ended year 11, he didn’t talk to me much at school but I didn’t make mad to much because I was too busy with my friends anyway. After our last day of school the relationship properly started, he took me on the most amazing dates and would never let me pay even when I tried to pay when he wasn’t looking I thought it was the best relationship as we had been friends for 3 years and always sort of flirted with eachother he met my family and it was going well but I noticed few things like he always seemed to get looks of snaps from girls and would say ‘she won’t stop sending me nudes’ but never blocked her or told her to stop. He started to text a girl that he talked to a few months before we started going out and he would talk to her when I wouldn’t do “things” with him. He broke up with me over text at a motive in a field and left me with no way home while I was blackout drunk. The next day we got back together because he said ‘you don’t give me enough “affection”’ and I believed it was my fault. He started fingering me when I didn’t want him to and then when we started having sex stoped taking me out. I couldn’t feel much so I pretended and even when I didn’t want to would feel like I had to and would think ‘well I can’t really feel it anyway so I should just do it’ he started becoming more aggressive and hurt me a few times without meaning to. I’ve had bad past relationship and carried bit of trauma so I was nervous to give oral, but he would say ‘if I don’t force you, you won’t do it’ and would always push my head down or put it in front of my face and try to force me to put it in my mouth. He always tried to make our like he was giving me anything and I wasn’t giving anything back and he deserved me to get over it and just do it. The time that has affected me the most was when the euros was on, I was celebrating with my family and he asked me to come over I was drunk but I was at the football club and he lives 2 minutes away so I went. He convinced me to have sec that night when I didn’t want to but I said he had to wear a condom as I missed my pill 2 days ago and it takes two days of not missing be protected, he told me he was going to put it on and when to the bathroom and then come back. He didn’t wear a condom and I got pregnant. I didn’t find out till a week before my prom, I had an infection in my leg and the tested me as I hadn’t gotten my period and the prescription. I was 7 weeks pregnant and my then boyfriend was away for over 3 weeks to see his dad and visit his home country. It was also a week before my school prom and I was panicking, I didn’t tell anyone because I was angry at myself that I was so weak to allow all this to happen to me. On my prom night he cheated on me and posted this girl all over his insta to make my night about him. I broke up with him the next day as I saw it a 3 in the morning. I was scared and stressed out about what I was going to do. A couple of days later I went to my best friends house to try to cheer me up I had a metallic taste in my mouth, like coins but more irony, and had a bad feeling I was getting terrible stomach pains and heavy bleeding and I had no idea what to do because I still hadn’t told anyone I tried to pretend to was ok and I was just my period and nothing else. My best friend at the time dragged me to the gym so I could take my mind off him. Anyway later I was at my Nanna’s for her birthday and to stay for a while and this is when my best friend decided to start an argument I didn’t want one and I was trying to mediate it but after a while I just snapped all the trauma I was burying came out in a burst of anger And I said things I really shouldn’t have and I’m so sorry for that. When I went back to school me and the guy had spoken after he had shown up at my work and we decided we were going to be civil as we were going to be in sixth form together. I also told him about the miscarriage as he needed to know I wasn’t pregnant he shouted while following me down the road as we live only afew minutes away from eachother. He spread around the school the other was all my fault that I had a miscarriage and that I cheated on him. The school didn’t do anything, they told people to stop gossiping about it but didn’t talk to him. A few week of this still going on the help a poorly presented assembly about sexual assault which made it worse. I tried to have a real but I just don’t feel safe anymore and i cant have a guy touch me or have sex because it scares me and I have flashbacks. It’s been a few months but I still feel numb and think about the miscarriage every night and I don’t think u will ever be fully over it. I so badly want to press charges and go to the police because I fell like I would be being selfish if I didn’t to help others but most cases get rejected because there’s insufficient evidence or no one believes you, so I’m not sure if I can’t do it yet as I’m still not over the loss. If you read this thank you sorry it was so long. I needed to get it off my chest and didn’t want to feel alone anymore.",,
"I got attacked during break at school, having over 4 people touching me in places i didn't want to be touched. grabbing my boobs. On top of this, i've had my physics teacher touch my hand and talk to me in a seductive manner which i didn't feel comfortable with. he'd touch me and stroke my hair and block the door so i couldn't escape. he makes me stay behind after lessons and sends me letters in the post and i hate it so much. i've tried to move classes but he just always ends up declining the request. he makes me so uncomfortable. he's tried to strip all my clothes off me and touch my boobs and even licked my neck.",,
"I have been assaulted by 4 boys from this school but these stories have been shared by their friends and were laughed about. The assaults range from groping to non-consensual sex (I was drunk, they were sober and ‘looking after me’ and took me to their house even though I had said that night I wouldn’t sleep with them). Not a single story is a secret but all of them were seen as funny.",,
"Drunk in a bar in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and a guy wouldn’t leave me alone. Friends said he wouldn’t go away when they asked him too. I have almost no recollection of the night and woke up to a message from him saying ‘when you taking me out then', I had to ask him who he was.",,
I was sexually assaulted by two boys in my class and one of them even went on to do it to so many others. They did ut to me because they thought it was funny. I went on to report this and all that happened was that they were told to stay away from me. Later on I would begin to be sexually harassed by other boys in my year for two more years which caused me to genuinely fear going to school and walking around the building. I was also again sexually assaulted by a different boy and he didn't receive any punishment although our school policy was that of anything like that happened they would be expelled. When I also reported these events I was victim blamed. I was also panicking severely about having to share a classroom with two of my sexual assulters when I usually don't and was told to just get over it and that I'd have to deal with it even though I was visibly distressed. Eventually I gave up reporting them because nothing was getting done about it and there was no point.,,
"I was in year 8 at the time and he was in year 9, he was quite popular and me and my friends weren’t really that popular, I was walking to class when he groped me, I went to class and cried then told a teacher, I was sent straight to report it, the teachers were lovely to me, I was so embarrassed but one of the first questions they asked me was if I had done anything to provoke it. In the end nothing happened, the cctv was at the wrong angle and his friends denied everything, he was left to walk round school with me, a few weeks later his friends kept shouting liar at me. It was awful I didn’t want to go to school for weeks but I didn’t report anything because what was the point. School only spoke to me once and that was the day I reported it, the deputy head rung my mum and that’s it. Nothing else happened. He only left the school in may and until then everytime I saw him I felt embarrassed inside",,
"Various rating systems. I know of (and was on) two but i’m sure there were plenty more. [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] had a list where each boy would gain points based on how far they went with a girl (ie 1 kissing, 5 penetrative sex) and they either gained or lost points based on how attractive the girl was, as rated by the rest of the group of boys. Most points wins.,The other was a poll at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys. On their entire year’s facebook group chat, they had a poll to vote for the girl who had kissed/had sex with the most people in their year. Essentially, who was the fittest/most likely to ‘put out’. I don’t want to think what was said in individual group chats if that was the whole year’s.",,
The boy I used to see everyday told me that everyone did it and that he would expose me if I didnt do what he asked,,
I was sexually assaulted by all the boys and looked at by the male teachers,,
When I was 14 / 15 I was at a party and was very drunk as I didn’t know many people and felt quite uncomfortable. Everyone could see that I was too far gone. One guy sat next to me on the sofa I was passed out on and started getting with me and groping me under my clothes. When I regained full consciousness I looked around and asked people to help me while he was still on top of me and they all laughed. For years I thought this was normal and a part of normal party behaviour. Everyone I spoke to told me it’s not that deep and he must have thought I was conscious. This is not ok and I wish I knew that then.,,
"When I was 17 years old I had a boyfriend. I agreed to give him a blow job. Towards the end, against my will he grabbed my head and shoved his penis deep down my throat. It was for an uncomfortable amount of time and was noticeably very rough. I tried to stop him but it was too late. I then vomited on his penis and onto the floor. I felt his cum coming into my nose and stinging. I was so ashamed and I felt disgusted at myself. I then cleaned the rug whilst he proceeded to not care. I’ll never forget.",,
"When I was 11 I was in the park with my mum and friend, we were on the swings playing, there were a group of guys around 19-24 outside the park on a bench. One of them who looked around 23 walked up to my mum and asked how old I was, she told him I was 11 yet he still continued to ask if he could be my boyfriend. I could hear the whole conversation and was really scared, he still lives in my area and I see him walking around sometimes. I’m now 14 and I can’t go anywhere myself as my mum is scared I’ll get attacked my him, why he thinks it was acceptable to say idk but it’s disgusting. I also got chased by him when I was walking home in year 8 I was rly scared so I ran to a shop but I ha to be escorted home by police, he still lives near me and everyday is a nightmare while I know he is here.",,
"I was only in year 6, when a boy physically tried to touch my privates, it was horrible. And he kept trying at one point he started harassing me and then talking about how he wanted to r@** me",,
"I was at my ex-boyfriends party. I was staying over too with my best friend- we had chosen a bed to sleep on but someone else got there first. So, we were hanging out in my ex's room. I secured a spot in his bed as there were some others in there too and started falling asleep. But he was feeling very anxious and so (as I have helped him lots in the past) spoke to him and hugged him which seemed to calm him down and I continued doing this when we would having anxiety attacks. But then when I was asleep he started touching me more intimately and his hand went down my pyjama bottoms and brushed over my underwear and vagina. I wriggled, confused, but then he put his hand back and only took it away when I wriggled with more force.",,
"Once I was on a school trip to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. My friend and I who were staying with a family together had heard catcalling on the street several times and felt uncomfortable about it but nothing quite compared to one day when we went to the beach. I was swimming in the ocean with some friends when a random man I didn’t know who was a friend of someone we were talking to grabbed me and pulled me into him. He wouldn’t let go of my hand and he put his other hand on my thigh, grabbing it. In the moment, I completely froze. I was unable to move or fight back. It took a good 10 seconds before I processed what was happening and asked him politely to get off of me before swimming back out to the shore feeling uneasy. I can’t remember his name or face, and I didn’t share what had happened with my teachers as I knew nothing could be done. But I still feel uncomfortable whenever I’m in the sea, as I’m scared soemthing like that could happen again.",,
"i was walking to school just after the 95% thing had just gone up, and the group of sexist (just uneducated assholes) started following me. i was absolutely terrified, as i had no protection to defend myself. eventually they caught up to me, pulled me into a bush and tried to put their hands up my skirt, luckily, after a bit of poking and prodding from them, i managed to get away, and run. these boys still look at me from time to time. i never told anyone because they wouldn’t believe me, as i’m a feminist, and i get made fun of for it. it’s truly heartbreaking what this world has come to :(",,
I’m a hijabi meaning automatically men and boys know I’m not interested in being touched by them and that I am not open to it. I was in year 10 and a boy who had recently came back to the school after leaving came to speak to me. Me and this guy were school friends but outside of school we would just say hi and that’s it. He was outgoing everyone knew him and he was actually Immature asf tbh he was like a child like his mindset was so childish. He didn’t have any special needs btw . Anywahs so I had an English lesson and I asked the teacher to go to the toilet. As I was leaving into the coridoor I saw the boy. He was excited to see me after such a long time and came close to me. He then literally grabbed my wrists and pushed me against the wall IN THE CORIDOOR OPENLY and was so close to me literally chest to chest. I was so uncomfortable to the point where I was red and laughing KEEp in mind I’m Asian so GOINF red isn’t that noticeable. He literally wouldnt let go off me and was holding my arms so tight and he was SO CLOSE TO Me like I couldn’t feel his breath when he was talking. He wouldn’t let go after I kept saying move and stop until I kneed him and ran to one of my friends. I literally felt so nasty because why would he even do that knowing I wear hijab and that I’ve never shown interest in him. I felt like he had a crush on me anyways because of the way he would always approach me and try to speak to me and complement me even after this situation. My friend who’s outgoing once told him to fuck off and leave me alone because she could see how obsessed he was getting and how uncomfortable and annoyed I was getting with it. I remember a guy in mt year walking past and staring because the sight actually looked so weird he was pinning me to a wall and I was laughing but because I’ve never felt that uncomfortable in my life and the feeling I had when I ran away was actually traumatic. When I tell my friend s they’re so used to being sexualised that they probably didn’t think it was deep but it’s something I’ve never forgotten and EVERYTIME I see him I pray he doesn’t come up to talk to me. My friends still don’t know how much it actually affected me even tho it’s not as bad as what others go through AT ALL it’s just the fact I got disrespected like that.,,
"One time a male teacher asked me to roll down my skirt, but I was sitting down so he couldn’t possibly have seen the true length of my skirt. Maybe not so extreme, and possibly innocent, but I remember feeling so violated, why are my legs a distraction for a grown man?",,
i dated this guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. we were only together for around a month but he pressured me into doing so many things i was uncomfortable with. he was a year older than me and had already had sex before (i hadn’t) he then tried to have sex with me but i said no but because he was ‘horny’ he had sex with me anyway even though i clearly said the word no! i felt so used and i felt dirty. afterwards he ignored me for a week and then broke up with me. he used me for sex and then discarded me! he took my virginity and i will never forgive him for that. His friends were also racist and he sexualised so many other girls as well!,,
"I am 30 and married and sex with my husband is such a struggle for me, even though i love and trust him. As i teenager i was raped by one boyfriend, coerced and assaulted by another. I have been groped and harassed by strangers on the street or in bars more times than i would be able to recall. Even family members have had friends that have made inappropriate looks and comments toward me at a very young age. I have also found that in times i have felt strong enough to reject male advances they are met with rage. I don't think i've ever been able to say no to someone without them making me justify my reason and in most cases this has involved shouting and intimidation. This has happened to me so often that i am unable to feel like my body belongs to me, there is a complete disconnect there and even so many years on my sex life and my husband have to suffer as a consequence.",,
"When i was 10 i went on holiday with my family and i had a cousin who was a couple year older than me and one time i had to sleep with him since there wasnt enough room and he grabbed my hand and placed it on places i didnt want to touch and he pulled me close to him and told me i shouldnt tell anyone. a couple years later he did the exact same but he pushed me onto the bed and pulled my legs apart and started lying down on me and pulled my shirt down to kiss my chest. he was on me for a long time and i couldnt even do anything cause i was so scared and he put his hand over my mouth as well and i wish i never had talked to him in the first place and when i told people the blame was placed on me. i wanted to cry when he was doing all that stuff to me and when i tell my friends they dont even care cause im meant to be the brave one. it also happened to me with another cousin (who is the same age as me, im currently 14) the same time i went on holiday, in the duration of 2 months they both sexually assaulted me. he placed his hand on my inner thigh and would just go higher and higher i would even push it away but he would still carry on and sometime he would kiss my cheek near to my lips. he would follow me everywhere and would get a blanket and cover both of us with it and start touching me. i never told anyone about this story cause i knew i would get the blame. i hate myself for even letting it happen",,
I was raped and could do nothing about it,,
I was 18 years old and met a fellow student for a date. We had some drinks in our halls of residence afterwards. She was also a student. We were both drunk but I was fully aware of what as going on. At one point during our conversation she advanced towards me and touched my hand and then tried to kiss me on the lips. I was shocked. I told her this was unwanted and she kissed me again. I left immediately and reported her but nothing ever came out it. I felt ashamed and violated.,,
"I’m 32 now, but when I was in year 9, a group of friends were all meeting after school, everyone was going home to get changed first but I didn’t live close to school so one friend offered for me to wait at his while he gets changed and we all meet everyone together. So me, him and another boy went to his parents flat who weren’t home. The boy who’s flat it was decided he want to watch me and the other boy kiss, I said I didn’t want to, and they both called me boring and said stop being stupid, they pressured me into kissing him then they made me kiss both of them while they started to feel me up, they put their hands in my shirt and up my skirt and put their fingers inside me. I was terrified and frozen and didn’t know how to make it stop. I told the school teacher the next day and she replied with “am I sure that that’s what happened” they made me sit in the classroom after school and asked me again did it actually happen I knew they didn’t believe me so I just said no, they didn’t ring or contact my parents. They had told the boys what I said and they were waiting for me outside the school. I remember seeing him running down the road screaming at me calling me a bitch and a slag saying I wanted it. I was known as the slag for the rest of my time and it ruined my school life. I stopped going into school the next year and ended up being put on extended study leave. The school didn’t want me to be there so they let me come in just to do my GCSEs and I failed all of them. It followed me through my whole life I developed a fear of saying no or talking about anything anyone did to me after that. I went through my 20s thinking just give them what they want because it’s easier than them taking it anyway. But then I was judged for sleeping around when realistically if anyone tried to sleep with me I just went through the motions of it too scared to ever say no. Because of those first experiences In school. They shaped my sexual boundaries well in to adult hood and something I am only coming to terms with now",,
I was followed into my school toilets and groomed by a boy,,
My ex boyfriend continuously sexually assaulted me while we were together. He touched me in school and continued in PDA I was uncomfortable with. Teachers could see my mental health declining and said nothing. I didn’t even realize it was sexually assault at the time because I was so in love and naive.,,
There were multiple times where I got sexual assaults and there was even a time where seven guys touched my ass and tried to kiss me (in under two hours),,
"During my first year at uni I brought a guy back to my flat. It was the first time I had sex and the one thing I knew I wanted was for him to wear a condom. He put it on, didn’t try to stimulate me or anything so it was very painful for me. I was extremely drunk, I hardly remember the night but I do remember that at some point he had taken off the condom without telling me and kept trying to force himself even though I wasn’t w*t at all. I was too drunk to really realise what was happening. Turns out he had also given me gonorrhoea. It was the first time I had sex, and left me feeling tainted and dirty. I kept telling myself I was fine with him taking the condom off but in reality, I realised it too late and was too drunk to say anything coherent. I couldn’t do anything sexual for a long time after that.",,
"After I’d finished doing bits with a guy in his room we went downstairs to grab a drink and chill. walked downstairs, grabbed water and sat on his couch. that whole process was what, 2 minutes? when we sat on his couch I saw on his phone messages from his boys GC saying “how was the bj” and private messages from like 5 of his friends gassing him up. he must’ve told his friends the second after we stopped doing bits because his phone was flooding w texts about me doing stuff to him. idk it just felt so weird and I felt rly uncomfortable he’d shared with other people what we had done when these things should be kept private within the relationship only",,
"I was 16 and he was 19, he used to get me really high or intoxicated to do things, he was rough, and sometimes when I said no he would keep pushing me until he had his way, the last time was when I was crying he told me to stop crying and that everything was okay even though it wasn’t. He said it was my fault and that I seduced him even though I didn’t. I have no proof or anything because I didn’t go to the hospital and it’s nothing you can have solid evidence with. That’s why I’ve kept silent.",,
"I was assaulted by my boyfriend when I was 18. I told him I didn’t want to have sex but he carried on like I wasn’t there. It was terrifying because he was supposed to look out for me and protect me, it broke my trust on a whole other level. He convinced and manipulated me to keep it quiet for months after. I didn’t tell anyone until after we had broken up. It’s messed up my relationship with sex to this day.",,
"i was in year 7, i was 11. i had just finished school and i was excited to get home - i was waiting for my mum to pick me up. a group of men in their 40's turned up and started to ask me questions and tried to persuade me to get into their car. i didn't know what to do. i sped past their car. i was scared. in october, i was also spoken about in science talking about how ""fit"" i am, because i was 'well-developed' for my age. this quickly turned to how i was ugly & a waste of space",,
"A female guidance teacher pulled me aside after class to tell me my top was too low (no uniform school) and that it wasn’t fair as I would distract the male teachers from doing their job and the boys from concentrating in class. There were other girls in the class wearing the same top, but I had developed and they hadn’t. Girls developing women’s bodies is not ok because we temp poor men who can’t possibly avert their eyes if they see an inch of flesh. Great attitude for a guidance teacher. I wonder if she covered up her misogyny when men were present?",,
"He told me woman enjoy being raped, this should have been the first red flag. During our relationship he forced me to have sex multiple times :(",,
"I had been speaking to this boy who went to the school for a little while, we got along well and went on a few dates it wasn’t anything serious. One evening he sent me explicit pictures on snapchat and wanted some back from me. I explained to him that i didn’t feel comfortable doing that but and didn’t want to take our friendship to that level anymore and we agreed to just be friends. Two days later he sent me pictures again but i just ignored them A week or so later we were at a friends party i spoke to him as i normally would but tried to give some space as i felt a little bit uncomfortable around him. As the night went on i felt more relaxed as things seemed to be the way as they was before the pictures. At one point he told me to follow him as he wanted to show me something, he led me into the bathroom locked the door and started to kiss me, i tried to push him away and i told him no but he was a lot stronger than me and i couldn’t, he pushed me onto the floor and got on top of me as he took my top off and then tried to my bra off. I kept trying to get him off me but i couldn’t. He started to dry hump my body as i laid there, I was screaming but you couldn’t hear it over the music outside i don’t think. I remember my body becoming almost frozen i didn’t know what he was going to do next After what felt like forever my friends came looking for me they heard something in the bathroom and didn’t know what was going on they unlocked the door from the outside and came in. The boy tried to push them out meaning he was finally off me and one of the girls helped my find my top , we ran upstairs to another room where i discovered the bruises he left on my body. All i wanted to do was a get out of there and get home, the girls i left with helped me leave without him seeing. The days after i tried to talk to his friends about it but they told me that’s how life is in sixth form and that i must’ve wanted it if i went on dates with him. It was my fault for leading him on when i followed him into the bathroom. Every time i think of my sixth form life that’s all i can remember, I’m still scared to meet new people for the fear they will do the same. I’m grateful the girls came looking for me when they did.",,
When I was 18 I started dating a lad for the first time. We went to a nightclub together then went back to my house. As soon as we got to bed he jumped on top of me and tried to have sex. I said I didn’t want to but we kept trying to persuade me and wouldn’t get off. I said I would scream and get my dad but he said he didn’t care and still tried to undress me.,,
I was raped when I studied abroad in London. I blocked most of it out and it took me 4 years to realize and accept what happened to me.,,
"I had a boyfriend who kept going on and on about sex even though i told him no , i said no 14-15 times before he just kept going and didnt stop. I pushed him off me eventually and ran out grabbing my clothes his mum saw me leave having a panic attack and later yelled at me for ""corrupting"" her son.",,
"I was nine years old, when i was at home with my grandfather, he asked me if i wanted “punishing”. I didn’t know what to say, soon after that conversation he sexually touched me. When my mother and grandmother came back from food shopping, my mother had noticed something was wrong, I told her what happened. My grandmother after went to my grandfathers work and yelled at him. Nothing else happened after that and they all acted like it didn’t happen.",,
"when I was younger (around 13) I was doing a lot of drugs and behaving recklessly to cope with things- at the time me and this boy were on/ off and one night I told him not to do anything with me because of how high I was, because I wouldn’t be able to control myself etc. I can’t remember the night AT ALL but we ended up doing bits after I kept telling him no and my friends had told him to stop seeing as how out of it I was. We were both v young and i don’t think he’s evil or anything but I really do think if his school had educated him on these things it never would’ve happened. Tbh the worst part was that it was spread after by people I didn’t even know that well that my close friends had told, I never ac spoke up about it or got to speak to him about it.",,
"I went to visit a friend at uni and ended up sharing a bed with another male friend who was visiting too, we had known each other for years so I thought sharing a bed with him would be fine. As soon as we were in bed he tried to kiss me and said he wanted to have sex with me. I said I didn’t want to, and he started shouting at me saying there was something wrong with me and being really aggressive and malicious, this lasted hours until I pretended to fall asleep, I wanted to leave but I didn’t have anywhere to go",,
A boy nearly raped me when I was 14. He was at my house to walk with me to school and we had just started dating. I explicitly told him that I wanted to take things slowly as I was young and we had tried before and it had gone wrong. I kissed him consensually but then he attempted to perform oral sex on me while I told him to stop. He said its fine and carried on and I was unable to stop him as he is far bigger than me. A different time a similar thing happened but he pulled his pants down and got on top of me. I was really scared.,,
I recently left my house and there were two men sat on the wall outside which is part of my property. I live in a safe area so assumed they were waiting for something and wanted to sit down. I walked past them and they said I looked fuckable. Although it shouldn’t matter I was wearing cargo trousers and a jumper and a full face of makeup and heeled boots. I asked them to leave me alone and they chased me into the road and threatened to hurt me. Not only was this a terrifying experience in itself it happened right in front of my own home leaving me feeling unsafe leaving the house as these men now know where I live and that I was afraid of them. I now carry my keys between my fingers at all times of day from the second I leave my house to the second I’m home if I’m alone. I know how many women have worse experiences of physical assault but wanted to share the impact which the location of my harassment and the threats made have had on my confidence. I haven’t worn eyeliner or heels since that day outside of my house.,,
I was walking towards my maths lesson in year 8 when a group of 7 boys surrounded me in the corridor and two of them grabbed my genitalia even though im male through my clothes.,,
"i was 12 turning 13, one of my closest friends at that time, who was 1 year older, just kissed me on the lips. in class. i was so uncomfortable, but i never really thought anything about it. she was like a popular girl, i figured that she'd done that to her other friends and it wasn't a big deal. it probably isn't, but i just am so mad about it. i remember telling someone about it, and all they said was “nice” and i felt really disgusted and invalid because it wasn't “nice”. she did it without consent, and i was so uncomfortable. till this day, i think she did it because i was a female and one of her best friends, so she figured it was okay. i don't really think she knows i thought about it. but what's done is done, and you can't change it.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by my cousins cousins the same night she was raped by them and I was too young to even know what had happened, and I just always felt too embarrassed to come forward. More recently the last guy I was with would always pressure me to give him head even when I explicitly said “no i don’t want to’ and when I was intoxicated to the point where i couldn’t see straight",,
Was constantly begged to send nudes to one boy for three months at the age of 14. When I finally gave in he screen shotted them without me knowing and sent them to all his friends. These friends then blackmailed me saying that they would spread my nudes if I didn’t send them before.,,
the school knew about the boy who would grope me and my friends in the halls and blamed me for it.,,
I was raped when I was 5 by my moms new boyfriend,,
in a drama lesson a boy in my class was moving me around for our group play and he was moving me by touching the sides of my chest.,,
"So I had just joined a new school and became friends with this guy who was also new but he started to act very weird around me and made it very clear that he was into me and I made it clear that I wasn’t into him. Eventually things started to get weirder as he once cornered me up against a wall saying ‘where is my kiss goodbye?’ I kept on saying no and eventually he stopped. People started a joke about how into me the guy was and at first I laughed along with it. That was until he learnt my timetable off by heart and knew where I’d be every second of everyday. Once I tried to get away from him by saying I have a meeting with my tutor and he insisted on walking me there so he walked with me. He then asked me ‘do you know why I have my jacket covering my crotch?’ I said no and he replied ‘because I have a boner for you’. Disgusted all I could do was keep walking. He kept on writing me letters, drawing pictures of me, writing songs about me and I felt scared to go to my lessons knowing he could show up. Eventually I told my head of year and things were resolved but it still makes me nervous to this day around guys who just don’t understand that no means no.",,
"I can’t even figure out where I am supposed to start with this. So many things along these lines have happened to me, i’ve been sexually assaulted and raped multiple times across different years on school grounds. Boys especially consistently defend these people, acting surprised that rape culture is so deeply embedded in our culture and have recently been hounding girls to explain to them what has been happening as ‘is it really like that? he seems so nice though!’. I don’t think they understand the toll that can take on those who have been through something like this. I won’t speak for anyone else, but whenever i’ve been forced to say yes this is true i immediately go back to being forced to do anal while crying in the school bathroom and then pushed to the ground where he came over my face, after which he left laughing and went back to his friends, acting as though nothing had happened. he took a photo of me like that, and has never done anything with it except keep it so he can keep me silent.,Please, don’t force anyone to go through additional emotional labour just because you struggle to fathom that the people you hang around have hurt others.",,
"I had my first boyfriend in year 11 so I was new to it and was very naive in my thoughts. We’d go on fun dates and have a good time but he’d always want me to give him head to ‘finish off the date’ I always went along to make him happy but I hated it cause it was always in my mind as this is the reason he’s dating me. Our dates would almost be a dread for me and he never understood that I didn’t want to, he’d always tell me it would be fun and tried to convice me. He was from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]",,
"I was at a party one Halloween, where a boy shut the door so no one could get in and we continued to kiss each other, he then tried to take my shorts off me when I repeatedly said no but he continued to touch me until I was able to push him off me",,
I was walking down a crowded street when I was cut of by three teenage boys they were asking for my snap I said no then they started groping me and talking about how I looked like a good fuck they were in sixth form and im 14,,
i was told by a fellow classmate who was sexually attracted to me that if a teacher wasn’t there he would’ve fucked me under the stairs.,,
"I was 14 at the time, we were dating but I never consented to him touching me like that under the table. I didn’t know what to do. I thought it was okay, we were dating after all. It happened in a room full of people who will never find out. I deserved so much better.",,
"my ex boyfriend would constantly coerce me into having sex with him, when ever I said no he would always keep pushing and pushing, usually until the point where I was in tears from him shouting at me and making me feel guilty for not wanting to ‘do such a normal thing with my boyfriend’ , he would make it out like I was making him feel bad about himself because I didn’t want to have sex. it happened more times than I can count. Now when ever a boy wants to do anything sexual with me I always say yes even if I really don’t want to and even if I’m majorly uncomfortable because I’m scared that they will shout at me or make themselves the victim.",,
I was a fresher and went to a uni event where I didn’t know anyone and I was very drunk. On the dance floor this guy grabbed me and started kissing me and took me out of the room to a staircase where no one else would be. There he started to kiss me quite aggressively and kept trying to have sex with me when I clearly didn’t want to and was too drunk to give consent. I remember trying to say no several times but he didn’t listen and ended up fingering me quite aggressively (while I said no and tried to resist) to the point where I was bleeding for several days. After that I think he was trying to bring me to his place or somewhere but thankfully we bumped into a group of people and I managed to stay with them until he left me alone.,,
I was touched various times by clasates and none of the staff did anything.,,
"Over a couple of years, I was begged by boys my age to send nudes and coerced into doing so, then they sent them around their friendship groups. I was touched up under the tables in lessons by one of them, who tried to touch me at parties too, not understanding ‘I don’t want to’. I was invited to parties by boys in the year above who got me drunk and took advantage of me. Boys 2 or 3 years above would stare and talk loudly about me whenever I walked past. Once the boys in my year groped me in the middle of the playground, in front of everyone. Being sexualised so young really effected the way I viewed myself, and I wish there was someone there to tell me that kind of thing wasn’t okay, so i didn’t think it was normal.",,
"When I was in year nine and ten (2016-2018) I was on several occasions sexually harassed by a girl in my year. At times she would walk past me and grab my private parts, without my consent, and then walk off laughing. She is still at that school and she has just finished her a levels and she has without a doubt done something similar to other people.",,
"When I was 17, I went on a ski holiday with my sister (19) and her friends from university. There was lots of flirting and I ended up kissing this guy. One day the weather wasn't great and I didn't feel well, so I decided not to go skiing with the others. This guy decided to stay back also. He climbed into the bed I was in and lay against me. I was facing the wall. He started to talk about how wide the forth of his penis was and I was scared. I didn't want him there and I just tried to be still so he would go away. He didn't and he forced it into me. I had to spend the rest of the holiday in the same apartment as him. I felt that I couldn't tell anyone because they had seen me kissing him. This was 30 years ago and noone talked about these things. 10 years ago, he looked me up on LinkedIn and I collapsed - I told my husband and finally also my sister."",We’re both survivors but this has affected our lives.",,
"An upperclassmen thought it would be fun to take advantage of me. Forcing me to do things to him, or my social and school life would be destroyed. It’s scarred me the things I had to do and I’ve felt gross ever since.",,
"One man raped me when i was 13, another orally raped me when i was 14. one runs the raf section of cadets at the school and holds a lot of power. he’s assaulted so many more girls in my year.",,
I was repeatedly sexually harassed at school by a group of boys from 13-15 years old. They would shove me into lockers and gather around me so that teachers and peers couldn’t see one specific boy put his hands up my skirt or touch my body. I asked them to stop I even told staff… I never made a scene because I was scared and embarrassed someone else would see. I just wanted it to end… I never gave consent. I was also only 13. The boy grew up to assault other people In the same area.,,
"I was touched inappropriately in school by another boy in my class , a teacher saw and took me out of lesson instantly n reported it , the police were involved and the boy never returned , I was 15 , the school were really good checking if I was okay and offering support",,
I was raped by my bf he would never say let me say no and I always felt like I had no choice I was always scared,,
"Daily we would be touched inappropriately, making us feel uncomfortable, or dramatic if we ever said anything. Yet the school never did anything. Peer pressured to send inappropriate pictures and sharing them amongst themselves.",,
"I was coerced into sexual intercourse at a party after a few drinks by someone I had known since we were babies and whom I considered a good friend. He was forceful and aggressive in his actions and although I had given him a condom and explicitly asked him to use it, he took it off when I was not looking even though I did not consent to it.,The reality of what happened to me did not set in for a while and I’m still coming to terms with what it actually was. I knew how he behaved was wrong, though, so I approached him to tell him to be more careful with how he conducted himself in similar situations. When I did, I was met with, “You liked it, don’t try and pretend like you didn’t.”",,
"The boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] had group chats that they would send the nudes they received into. I remember sitting on the coach from sport and the boys were laughing at someone’s nipples. It made me terrified of exposing any part of my body to anyone, and horribly self conscious. I left years ago but those feelings don’t go away",,
"So basically for the last 6 years I’ve been at secondary school and there had been a boy in my year who has always been overly touchy and vocal when it comes to sexual subjects and people’s body’s. He would say that he was gay and so it’s okay for girls to send him nudes and he would tell them what to improve. He would always touch people at school inappropriately, like touching your butt and boobs in lessons and on the school premises. I was once at a party with him and we were both drunk and he asked me to take my top off while lifting it up as he spoke, thankfully nothing happened as someone walked in but it still makes me feel sick. In the last two weeks he has been put into a position of more power as head boy; this has made many of the girls in my year worried, we feel unsafe.",,
"When I was 5 my class was on a school bus preparing for a trip I was sat next to a boy also 5 who I had never talked to he asked me ""can I touch under your skirt"" I said no he replied asking why I told him I felt uncomfortable and he proceeded to quickly lift my skirt and touch me untill a teacher came by",,
When I first enter 9th grade their were this boy who thought he could do anything he wanted. He would touch up on us girl and he would touch us where we didn't want to be touch. And sometime he would force us to do thing with him. There were time that he would hit us and we all try tell the teachers to do something but they wouldn't do anything to help us.,,
I know this is slightly different because I’m a guy but I was at a party and we weren’t allowed to go to the toilet in the house so I went in a bush because I had quite a bit to drink. Three girls came over to me together and asked me to get with their friend. I said no because I didn’t want to and then they took a photo of me whilst I was taking a piss and they said to me that they would send my mates the photo. I didn’t even get to see whether the photo was clear but I said no still to getting with the friend but they didn’t do anything in the end but it was still scary. I don’t know the school,,
I have always been sent nudes after I tell people I don’t want them to be sent,,
"I was jumped by a group of 6 boys in the gym, they shoved me around groping my butt and breasts, attempting to even pull my shirt off. it was even caught on tape but the school did nothing about it besides saying they would be talked to. But they weren’t. They got off scot free",,
Throughout my time at my school I experienced multiple messages from specific boys that were known for asking for inappropriate pictures. I would be threatened and fake accounts would be made just so they could continue to harass me. Whenever this was brought up to teachers or people who could help me I would left to continue to be harassed until they finally left. I felt so alone until I had found out that it had happened to many other people including my own friends,,
A guy I dated wanted to have sex but I feel i’m too young and said no he kept insisting but I kept saying no. I broke up with him and he has spread rumors that we hooked up and people have called me a slut. and when I tell them we didn’t i’m a prude. Then after he tells them i’m a slut he says it’s fine because I was fat anyway. i’m 130 pounds.,,
I was 14 when I was walking out of my English lesson and someone in the big crowd just grabbed my ass. Never knew who it was during the rush.,,
This boy was notorious for sending unsolicited dick pics to ALL the girls. As in at one point it was his ‘streaks’. Everyone thought it was weird then (y9 ish)- it’s only just now sinking in how disgusting/ belittling receiving that was,,
he told me that he just wanted to talk because i had just been dumped and my great grandpa had just died and he said he just wanted to be there for me when it was never about that when we thought someone was there first i went to the girls bathroom he went in the boys then we came out again and talked and hugged and then we thought there was someone else again and then we ran inside the gym then in the gym we hugged again and he tried to kiss me but the pe teacher was right there and we both ran into the girls bathroom after that we hid in the biggest stall and he got really close to me and asked if ge could kiss me once and i said yes and that was the only thing i wanted to do but he took it to another level he started to make out with me and then when we heard someone he sat down on the toilet and sat me on his lap forcefully and picked up my legs so they couldn't see my legs after that he tried making out with me again and he kept rubbing my inner thigh inching closer to my privates each time he would do it and then he kissed me even more and kissed my chest without asking me if he could the only time he asked me if he could was when at the beginning and said can i kiss you and i replied yes that was it none of the chest kissing the thigh grabbing,,
"I already posted on here about one of many experiences at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], but I fee as though it is necessary to highlight another story from my primary school. There was a group of boys who bullied me from reception up until year 3. I was so scared of these boys i would his in a tiny corner in the playground at break and lunch hoping they didnt find me. One day one of the boys came into the toilets after me and told me to come in the cubicle with him because he wanted to show me something, after being bullied by him i was terrified to say no and thought maybe he was trying to be friendly. He wasn’t. He showed me his genitals. After this he would tell me to come with him more often and he started making me touch him and use my mouth. One time he told one of the other boys in the group that bullied me to come and watch. This boy ran out and shouted it in the playground. The teachers heard. We were taken to the headteachers office and i told them what happened and that I was scared to say no and why i was scared to say no. They did not punish the boy. I wasn’t punished either. The most disgrcaeful part of this, is that they did not even tell our parents. They burried the incident and pretended it never happened. The bullying got worse after this.",,
"I am a 15 year old girl, I shouldn’t have to have experienced something so upsetting at this age. No one should but it’s something that needs to have attention bought to it. In year 7 a boy started bullying me, it wasn’t sexual to begin with but he did keep telling everyone we were going out which made me a little uncomfortable, he would make comments on the way I looked but then come year 8 he started making the sexual comments. I was 12, 12 years old and being told I was going to get raped in an alleyway by a group of boys my age. I cried yet the teachers didn’t do anything, I had to stay seated next to this boy despite being afraid of him. He sent me sexual messages commenting on what he liked about my body or what he wanted to do. I was upset, scared even. I wanted to just go home and cry which is what I did everytime. In year 9 it was the same things but got progressively worse, he made more rape threats which I wish people saw the severity of. He would touch my legs under the table, it’s humiliating having someone sexually harass you, i felt uncomfortable beyond words. He would tell all of his ‘friends’ to shout sexual comments at me as I walked past them including the use of sex toys. All this happened inside of school, where you are meant to be kept safe but I never once felt safe. It came year 10 now and [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] he had 2 girls with rape allegations against him, I feared him even more and then came the screenshots: he had made sexual comments about multiple girls, including myself. Comments about rape and my name were being used around school as if it were just some ‘gossip’ and what did the school say when I told them? ‘Just make sure you don’t walk home alone’ I have never felt more upset in my life. The boy moved schools but with no consequence for any of his actions, he will do the same to another girl of schools don’t stop this sort of behaviour. I needed mental support after that to deal with my paranoia and the school did nothing to help that. He has ruined my life at the young age of 15",,
i was 14 at the time. we had planned to hangout that day and do stuff but we both agreed no sex. i was very inexperienced at the time so i wasn't expecting much to happen. we were hanging out in his car and we went in the back seat and we started making out. he fingered me which i was more than ok with but then he asked for head. i was scared bc I've never done it before that day. i said yes and tried it and i stopped bc i hatted it. he said to keep going but i said no. he got upset and he said you could either finish me off or we can have sex. sex seemed like the easier option so i went with that even though that was the last thing i wanted to do. i don't think it was sexual assault bc i agreed to do it even though i knew it was a bad idea and i had just met him the day before. i miss the person i was before that day. i feel like all my innocence was stripped away from me and i hated it and i still do. i have nothing against the guy bc it was just a stupid mistake on my end. i will never get my innocence back and i think thats what hurts the most.,,
"At [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] there was a group chat where my boyfriend at the time was repeatedly told to film having sex with me, I was regularly cat called in front of teachers, and at one point told ‘get on your knees’ by a boy in a chemistry lesson with a teacher present. I was singled out and repeatedly sexualised by boys repeated times every day, and when I confronted teachers I was told it was mostly my fault and at one point I was excluded from school to ‘keep me safe’ from the boys NOT from my poor behaviour. I ended up having to leave the school which deeply impacted my mental health. My parents wrote and complained to the governing body, and nothing has still been done about it.",,
"Aged 15, on a fairly empty tube. A guy who looks probably between 18 and 22 approaches me, surrounded by his mates. He starts talking to me, a girl who definitely looks her age if not younger, and asks for my Snapchat. I tell him I don't have one. Not taking the hint, ""come on, you must at least have Instagram"". Luckily he stopped pestering once I told him my age but it was very intermidating being approached by a group of men. It would have made any woman, underage or not, feel uncomfortable. Public transport should be for everyone. Everyone should feel safe travelling alone. These men probably meant no real harm, but men should be more aware of how uncomfortable and intimidating their presence can be.",,
I was raped after a night out at University. I went to the police the next day but was told they couldn't do anything because I had washed myself. This was despite my breasts being covered in bite marks and CCTV footage from the nightclub. I told the university what had happened and there was no support whatsoever. I tried to take my own life and after that failed I dropped out of my course and was fired from my job because I missed a shift the day after it happened.,,
"I went on a school ski trip when I was 15. It was somewhere in Austria, and took place over New Years. On NYE many of us went to a bar in town and had a number of drinks before the curfew our teachers/parent chaperones had set. Once back at the hotel (and clearly drunk) we socialised with other guests. The next thing I remember is being in one of the hotel bedrooms with 3 grown up men stood around me, I was naked on the bed. Then my friends were knocking on the door, I was made to get dressed hastily and pretend nothing had happened. The next day the teachers had heard the gossip being spread by all the other kids about how I had had sex. They took me aside and blamed me, I wasn’t allowed to participate in any more of the trip (no skiing or evening outings) and on the flight home I was made to sit with the teachers, separated from my friends. I denied anything had happened, because I was made to feel like if it had then it was my fault. At the airport they went straight up to my mum and told her outright that I had had sex whilst on the trip. I spent my 16th birthday in my headmasters office writing a statement to confirm that I had not had sex, as they were threatening to kick me out of school. For the remaining time at school, and the following two years of college I was known as the girl who got “spit-roasted”. Not one single person provided me support or saw me as the victim. I was 15. I was drunk. I was under their care. The adults were so worried about how that would reflect on them that they let me take the blame. It was years until I was able to tell the true story. I was raped and no one cared.",,
"A school which is dominantly male should have done more to ensure girls are safe and that education on the topic of consent gender and abuse is thoroughly covered. This school had an epidemic of boys controlling girls as girls looked up to the boys to be liked as they contributed to most of there friends due to a low number of female students. Pressure for nudes were rife let alone the continuous sharing of them and eating, groping acts as basic greeting actions were the norm and blackmail was continuous. To feel validated or popular involved allowing boys to grab your body as a goodbye or when you were passed out drunk or even leaned over to pick up ur bag on the school bus home. To be told if you didn’t sit on someone’s lap they would all go home. To be openly rated as we walked into the common room in are school sports kit. The teachers did not do enough and this is something that will effect us girls and perceptions for life. The uncomfort was scarring.",,
"My friend at uni had mentioned her best guy friend was coming down to see her. I’d spoke to him in the background when he would FaceTime. He was a funny guy and we started talking privately. My friend knew all this she was really happy that we got along because of course we’d be hanging out. Well it was brought up that he was a virgin and things like that. Red flag. We really got on though. I was excited to meet him.,So he arrives we go out on a night out. It was a little awkward because my friend was with her bf so I felt like I was there to be her guy friends companion. Everyone got drunk we had fun. It was then decided he would stay at mine because she was staying at her boyfriends and her guy friend getting back into her room would be a lot of effort in the morning. Even though I had said to my friend her guy friend was lovely but it was a friendship and I had spoke to him saying it was more a friendship connection. I tried to avoid being tagged with “she led him on”.,We shared a bed fully clothed and straight away he was on top of me trying to make something happen. I was so drunk my body was numb. But nothing happened he was drunk and fell asleep pretty quickly when nothing clearly was going to happen.,In the morning he kept trying to touch my breasts and I said no. I had to get out of bed to get away from it. I called my friend she FaceTimed me. The entire time he was lay in my bed watching me get ready. I had to wait for him to get dressed and leave.,It was spoke about with my friend and the whole thing was pegged as miscommunication. I played it off as ok. My opinion of someone shouldn’t influence somebody’s opinion of that person. But to this day I hate being watched when I get dressed. And I hate not really sitting down and talking about it.",,
"I was sexually assaulted when I was fifteen.,The day after being interrogated by a guy I previously dated I started to question whether I’d acted like he said I did, rather than the way I remembered. Today it realized I was being gaslighted. He mentally manipulated me into thinking I was a bad person for speaking the truth and calling him out on his actions. For having sex with me when I wasn’t sober enough to consent to it.,Experiences such as these have impacted my ability to trust men to the extent that I feel too uncomfortable to even sit next to a man I don’t know on an airplane or bus. I wish I would have spoken out sooner.",,
"When I was 15/16 I started to date a boy in my year at high school, and he raped me. Before we started dating it was not unusual for a guy to show that he liked you by grabbing your breasts or bottom, both which I had experienced, it even went as far as him putting his hand in between my legs as I was walking upstairs. Bearing in mind this all took place down school corridors in the open, nothing was ever said by the teachers to explain why this was wrong. In sex ed we were educated on contraception, sexual orientation, masturbation and the hardships of parenthood. We were never told about consent and healthy relationships. I wasn't educated on how to react when my boyfriend told me he had a dream one night of how he would force himself on me. (Something he had seen in pornography),As a young girl who had never really seen porn, I never really knew how I was expected to act, or how extreme these boys wanted to take things. He would sexually assault me, and I didn't even know it. When he did rape me, I struggled to come to terms with it, I always thought rape would be violent, involving punches and hands held down. But this was coercion. He invited me into his bedroom, and simply would not take no as an answer, he would keep asking me until I gave in and said 'OK'. He didn't stop when I laid there silently and clearly was not enjoying the experience.,Although he raped me, which I will never be able to forgive him for, I do feel a sense of pity towards him.,Afterwards, he knew it felt wrong because I didn't react in the way a woman would in consensual intercourse. He told me he spoke to his male friend about it, and was comforted because his friend said he did nothing wrong. I too spoke to my girl friends about the experience and how empty and lost I felt, I was told this was normal and to simply get over it.,Everyone was on his side because I said 'OK'. All of us didn't understand that pressuring someone to agree to something is not consent.,I even told my strict parents about what happened because if it was consensual, why did I feel so dirty? Although disappointed in me for having sex outside marriage, my parents also never said to me that what happened was wrong.,It was 2 years after it happened, chronically depressed and in therapy when my therapist explained to me that I had been raped.,There is a serious lack of understanding of consent and coercion, and I believe that there are thousands of people who have been raped and not known it, simply because they had not been educated about it. And more seriously, the perpetrators have not been educated that this is wrong.,I think there needs to be a service outside the police for people who question if they have raped someone, or questions what they have done is wrong. Because I feel that if this service was available, I do think my rapist would have spoken to them and got the help he needed, and so would have I.",,
"In 2018 I was sexually abused by a pupil at your school who graduated that same year. This sadly was not an isolated incident as it was followed up by more sexual harassment from a group of his friends. This included being publicly shamed for being sexually abused as well as cornering me in a nightclub and discussing my private and traumatic sexual experiences out loud, commenting on my body and why this boy did what he did. In addition to this a friend and I were told to take our tops off and expose our private areas to a group of boys at a house party that year, whereby I felt extremely intimidated as I was one of the only girls left at the party. It took a whole load of confidence from me to stand up to them and leave. To say this probably the most embarrassing thing I have ever experienced is a huge understatement, not only to be treated like a sexual object but also to justify why I deserved to be sexually abused. I was and still am disgusted by this behaviour and it haunts me to this day knowing that they got away with this behaviour and were never taught or punished.",,
"When i was in year 9/10 i exchanged nudes with a girl and they were shared around without my knowledge/consent. I'd put this to the back of my mind and had borderline forgotten about it until this. While this isn't one of the more extreme stories its another example of how this stuff is so widespread, everyone knows people who this has happened to. This is clearly isn't a few bad people and is a widespread issue which needs to be addressed at the root of the problem. While these victims are obviously mainly female, i know for a fact that there are guys who are on the bad end of this as well. Don't be afraid to speak up just because you're a guy, the more awareness the better.",,
I was groomed by a 19 year old who had been grooming a lot of girls at the school and he ended up raping me when I was 14,,
"I was sexually assaulted by my friend at school , him and his friends would constantly make sexual comments and he touched me in areas I did not consent too , I trusted him.",,
"I was on night out dancing with my friends when a guy i barely knew came up behind me and started dancing up against me. I gave him the benefit of the doubt (as i may have been sending off the wrong signals). I told him to go away as i had a boyfriend. He pulled me in closer and said “that won’t stop me, i want you more” and groped my whole body. (I tried to get away but couldn't get him off me. My friend had to stammer over to claw him away from me whilst he was dragging me away from the dance floor)",,
"I’m only submitting this as I feel people often don’t discuss sexual assault where women are the perpetrators, as it makes men who are subjected to jt feel lesser or something. Hopefully reading this lets them know it’s not that at all. Earlier in the year a girl I know from a different university to me came into my room and started kissing me with no consent, after pulling away she did it again, forcing me to touch her and showing her breasts, due to the fact I lived with the girl as we were both second year, sharing a 2bed accomodation, I didn’t want to make things awkward between us, but as I have a girlfriend I pulled away once more, yet she carried on touching and kissing me. The girl the next day was acting as if we had been fully consensual, despite me having said no multiple times. There are of course men and women who have experience far worse than this and to those my heart goes out, but I hope anyone whose experienced these things finds the solace they need.",,
We would have socials where the boys would have competitions to take advantage and get to double figures with the number of girls they got with and it was seen as a win for the boys and they were such lads if they reached this figure..the girls were judged and just shows the double standards..,,
"I was raped March of 2021, at the time I didn’t even know it was rape because I was wasted on alcohol (he was sober) but I always wondered because before hand I told him nothing more than making out but when came the time I said “sure”. I didn’t know it was rape until we did a lesson in school that people cannot consent to sex if under the influence",,
There is a boy who used to go to my school who’s sexually assaulted me and numerous other people. He still has the audacity to snap chat me and my friends with the intention to get nudes and repeatedly sends texts even after he’s been aired.,,
"I was sexually assaulted at a party by a boy I sort of knew who is very good friends with a lot of my friends. It was a big party and I had gone to bed because I was too drunk and was practically asleep/ passed out when he came in. It lasted for hours, he didn’t stop when I said no over and over again and I even shouted at one point because it hurt so much. The combination of fear, exhaustion and alcohol meant I was literally frozen with fear; I couldn’t move. I had to force myself to stay conscious the whole time and begged him not to have sex with me. I think the only reason he didn’t was because there were other people in the room at the time sleeping, I have no doubt if we had been alone or if I had passed out he would have raped me. The whole thing was painful, aggressive, and utterly traumatising. I still remember the feeling of when I got home and saw all the blood in my pyjamas- I just couldn’t believe this had happened to me. It completely ruined my view of sexual relationships and how they’re supposed to work and impacted so many other aspects of my life I never thought it would.",,
A guy from this school I dated for a year and a bit he raped and abused me and still says I’m crazy and making it up 2 years later,,
"at a once party when I was 14, I ended up getting really drunk and this boy friends kept telling me to go upstairs but I was so out of it I wasn’t really listening so he helped me upstairs where his friend was waiting in the bedroom. I don’t really remember much but I could feel it and see the blood when he was done",,
When i was 7 a family friend of mine who was 16 had groomed me. She would first start it off as just forcing me to watch lesbian porn on her computer. But after a while it got physical. She would kiss me and try to make out with me and if i ever tried to object she would bite my tongue until it bled. She then started to go further by stripping me and touching me in unwanted area. Anytime my parents came into the room she said that she was helping me change because i asked for help and if i tired to say anything she would threaten me and beat me. It stopped when i was 9 after i moved away. I’m currently 14 and am invited to her wedding in a month and even now i haven’t told anyone except my best friend.,,
"I don't know what this is but i know that i felt so uncomfortable , my ex was trying to get me back and i didn't want to go out with him again but every time he saw he grabbed my bum and kiss me and i wouldn't do anything so he thinks its alright, I don't want to tell anyone in school because i'm the 'popular' and 'confident' girl and don't know what people would think of me if I told them.",,
A boy in my class pinned me and my friends against a gate and said let's make baby's multiple times while being uncomfortabley touched,,
"i was hanging out with a guy that i talked to for a few days. me, him and a few friends went to a party, that was very sketchy. when we left, we all went back to his cousins house. we all were watching a movie, but i was very visibly intoxicated. he texted me asking me to go in the other room, and for some reason, i did it. i was a virgin. i didn’t even have my first kiss yet. that night, he stole both of those things from me and i don’t know how to fix it.",,
the first time i ever got properly drunk was after gcses at reading festival. at some point i passed out in a tent and remember waking up to a bunch of people from my school (guys and girls) around me joking about how someone should check my pussy pulse,,
I was sexually assaulted by a boy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and as someone previously said I can’t go into detail about it because I would be recognised. After it happened I convinced myself and the people around me that I was in control of the situation but I really wasn’t. There were so many jokes circulating about it and whenever i met someone from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] they would bring it up and make fun of me. I told a close friend and he say to me ‘yh but you shouldn’t have let yourself be that drunk’. It makes me uncomfortable to see the boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] putting ‘share testimonies’ and ‘do better speeches’ on their social media when I know for a fact that they have sexually assaulted someone or are friends with a known assaulter.,,
When I was 15 my boyfriend at the time would constantly manipulate me into giving him head. He knew that i was struggling mentally but didn’t care. He would tell me that people who came forward about having been sexually harassed were stupid and that rape allegations were worse for males. When I was 12 a 19 year old came up to me and started grabbing my thighs even after I told him my age. I’ve been catcalled when in my school uniform and when I’m with my father. It’s ridiculous how frequently this happens.,,
At a party I was with a friend (it was her first ‘proper’ party) and we both got drunk and a boy who was interested in her took advantage of that. He was trying to get her upstairs and I pulled her arm so she wouldn’t go so he pushed me away calling me a bitch and telling me to fuck off and he was stronger than me so I couldn’t do anything about it. He assaulted her while completely sober while she was drunk and was only able to get away because she heard me shouting her name. I have always regretted not being able to do more to stop that from happening feeling it was my fault rather than his.,,
"I had a friend who would say sickening things and harass people online and assault his friends. I could recite dozens of stories of this guy. It made me and my other friends feel sick being associated to this guy,he would others guilt and victimise himself till we forgave him but its never sat well with me and i feel second hand guilt because he would go on to continue doing these things to others and my friends. It was disguisting hed threatened to rape someone,hed slit his wrists so his girlfriend wouldnt break up with him. Just be careful of manipulation and get these people out of your life as quick as possible.",,
"I was part of a group of kids on my street who were all of different ages, most of them older then me! I was about 10 when I developed a crush on a boy who was 4 years older and this one time he followed me home, he took me into my ally way of my house and told me to lie down and he led on top of me and rubbed his body up & down on mine! This would happen to me frequently whenever he had the chance to get me on his own. When I turned 11, he went further and pulled down my trousers and knickers and did things to me with his mouth. Then this one time, he was hiding out and called me over to him when I was walking on my own. I went to him and he asked me if I had started my period and I responded with no. He took me into some bushes and had sex with me! I remember running home and getting into the bath and being completely dirty down below! Deep down I must of knew it was wrong because I was with friends drinking and confronted this boy that he had took my virginity! Over the year he had sex with me 4 times and the last time was on my 12th birthday. It was not long after that I stopped going out with these friends and a few months later I had a phone call to see if I wanted to go out as he wanted to see me, I said NO. Then days later I was walking home from school & he was there calling me a slag. I’m a lot older now and have children around these ages and it often hits me just how young we were, especially me! What happened has never left me and the memories are so clear. I still don’t know if this was rape but, what I do know is that it was very wrong and he did take advantage of me, I’m so ashamed it ever happened! At the time I had heard he did it to other girls, who were a little older than me but, I have know idea what they think now! I just prayer that he has realised himself that it was wrong & that he isn’t that person anymore!",,
"Not directly about me but this happened a few years ago and has really stuck in my head. In class these two boys were talking about a girl from a party at the weekend, and one of the guys kept referring to the girl as “it”, and was saying “it kept following me around” , “it was so easy”. Was also comparing a girl to her older sister, and saying how the younger one hadn’t “grown out yet like her sister had” and it was a “shame”- we were in year 10. I’m not surprised to see all the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] stories because the school encourages a bullying culture anyway, which extends to rape culture.",,
"i have been assaulted by many boys at my school, even during lessons. one of these boys had asked me to get with him and i said no, after this he would sit next to me and touch me under the table. even though there was video evidence of this, the school decided to do nothing.",,
"I wouldn't consider myself a survivor as this wasn't anything major but when I was in year 7 at my current I was forced to take down my pants by a female in my class, I had told the staff at my school for a while, luckily she has left the school since then but, to this day, the school had done nothing about it",,
I was abused by my friend's dad when I was 10 years old. I was to scared to tell anyone.but as l got older l felt guilty for not saying anything.because what if he does the same thing to someone else.,,
I just wanna make it clear that I know that people have it so much worse than me and this is only a small thing but I was walking passed a pub and about 6 middle aged men started to stare at me because half an inch of my stomach was showing. A few weeks after that I was walking in my dress and every car that passed me had a guy staring at me and after 10 cars going passed I had a panic attack and ran home,,
i have been looked at inappropriately and touched in places i don’t want to be touched,,
When id get changed someone would try to look under my skirt and try and slide their hand up my thighs,,
"While I can’t face writing out my entire story, I felt this was important to be known. When my school discovered I had been abused and raped at 15, I was victim blamed and given no support - in fact quite the opposite. I was told I could go to the police but they were dealing with a ‘worse’ rape so there wasn’t much point. I was told that because I told my abuser it was fine (out of fear), AFTER it happened, that meant I consented. And when I couldn’t come into school afterwards due to trauma, and the fact my abuser faced no kind of punishment or discipline, I was told I needed to ‘come off my holidays’. All of this was classed as ‘safeguarding’ and ‘protocol’.",,
"I was 15, and had sex for the first time with this guy in the year above. I was inexperienced so trusted him to treat me well with it as he had sex lots of times before. before we had sex he told me to close my eyes so i did what he said. little did i know he was taking pictures of me in sex positions and when i said wtf why are you taking pictures of me he told me they were for his eyes only for later when i wasn’t there. i said i wasn’t comfortable with them and he said stfu be quiet and flipped me on my stomach. we had sex then but half way through when i was already in a panicked state from the unconsented pictures i said stop it hurts too much and he said haha that’s what i like, and i said no i’m not joking stop right now and he pushed me forward and continued to fuck me. i said i needed the bathroom after but in reality i locked myself in there and cried for 15 mins shaking, feeling taken advantage of, with the sense that is this what sex is all about. it wasn’t until months later when i realised how wrong this situation was but i still felt worthless and vulnerable.",,
This might not be as deep as other people’s stories but the boy that I was talking to talked me into giving him head every single time we had met even when I said no he would convince me into doing it. He compared me to other people and said everyone else does it so what’s the big deal. He also talked me into losing my virginity because everyone else he knows has lost it it I felt that I had to do it. I wasn’t ready but because he manipulated me to do it we had sex. I regret everything and wish I was strong enough to say no.,,
"At the age of 7 was repeatedly touched by my friend’s dad, at that time his wife would babysit me. I never told anyone because I thought it was a normal activity, it wasn’t till years later I realized. I claim that it has no affect on me but I’ve notice my lack of trust with men good or bad.",,
"When i was in year 8, there was this boy who sat next to me in spanish class and he was one of those types.who would annoy everyone for attention, especially 8n spanish, and one day he took it to the point of drawing on my upper thigh and trying to out his hand up my skirt, once i told the school what happenned he was given a lunch time detention that he didnt go to and then all was forgotten and he got away with it.",,
"I was in year 7 and I was walking home alone. I walking on the street my house was on and felt a tap on my shoulder. It was a boy I did not know, but I knew the school he went to due to his uniform since that school was very near my house, but I don't go to that school. Politely I said hello and he said hi back, he then began to compliment me, calling me cute and pretty. I knew his motivation behind this was sinister since I was a year 7 who looked much younger than her actual age, you could mistake me for year 5, and he was at least in year 9. I was flattered but still suspicious so I thanked him and kept walking. He then tried to put his arm around me and began asking person questions such as my number, where I live and if I am a virgin. I told him to leave me alone and that I don't give strangers that information but he insisted and insisted. We then stop speaking but he followed me all the way to in front of my house. He began to ask to hug me, even after I said no he continued to beg for a hug and blocking my way. I felt like if I decided to take my phone out to call for help he would stab me since it was obvious there was something large in his inside pocket of his blazer. I decided that I shouldn't make it obvious that this was my house, I was scared that he will remember where I live and do something bad to me next time, so I continued to walk and he still was following me. I did not know where I was going but I ended up in an unfamiliar area of my neighbourhood. I was lost and stuck with a stalker and this street was empty. I walked around for a good 10 mins until he gave up. I told my dad and he was furious but I begged him not to report it. I told my friends at school and they just laughed and brushed it off, they didn't believe me.",,
"My brother has made me feel uncomfortable for years. He would persuade me to watch explicit sexual films and tv programs with him when I was waaayy too young, ask intimate details about my sex life when I was older (including positions and dick sizes), and general unnecessary and inappropriate touching. My family could tell, no one ever said anything. He’s a policeman now.",,
When covid started a guy began to talk to me by snapchat everything was ok and i even knew his brother and we talked for about 2 months and then one day he started asking me to facetime and i agreed because it was very normal until he started telling me to take of my shirt and i didn’t like that but he told me that no one will ever like me if i siding do it and that no one would care so i did it,,
"On a night out a fair few years ago, I was followed and forced into a cubicle of the womans toilets in a night club. I was pushed into a cubicle and up against a wall and the man forced his tongue down my throat. I screamed and shouted and pushed managed to run out of the toilet. I told a few people who were there at the time. And tried to tell the bouncer but we couldn't find him. But I had been drinking and just thought as usual I'm too nice and didn't want to make a scene.",,
"I was at the end of my second year of university when I went on an educational trip to Zambia (organised by my university). One time, we were in a car with a few of the in-country teachers on the way to a bar. At this point, we had a few drinks already. It was a squeeze in the car, so I had to sit on one of the in-country teachers lap. I was a little bit awkward about it, but I tried not to dwell too much. Then he kept putting his hand up my dress, even when I told him it made me feel weird. That night, I argued with him and he told the rest of the girls on the trip. The most hurtful thing was that they told ME that I needed to apologise to him. I told them what he did, but they immediately brushed it off. I wasn't terribly affected by it, but that's because shit like that happens all the time. I'm so used to men trying to grope me that it's starting to seem normal. That's the hardest thing.",,
"i’ve had boys touch and grope me all throughout school, but as i’ve got older i’ve hit puberty. walking into pe was a nightmare as all the boys would watch you walk in and comment on your body like how big our boobs was or how nice our figures are. now in sixth form things are at there worst you go to a party and you may be drugged and touched, slut shaming happens everyday and even boys touching you at school infront of staff and then not doing a thing. being touched has become my normal and it shouldn’t be",,
My closest male friend raped me. I don't think he realises he did anything wrong and I'm too scared to tell anyone at all.,,
Kissed me without permission and wouldn’t stop when I told him to. Later told me about all the stuff he wanted to do with me.,,
"I was 15 at his house. He kept asking me to have sex over and over again, saying ‘if you loved me you’d do it’. I caved. Now I realise it was deeply wrong. He also used to manipulate me, telling me he had blue balls and was in pain and it was all my fault and I needed to have sex with him to help. When I refused again he slapped me across the face. He used to call me a ‘f*cking c*nt’ any time I challenged him on it, until I stopped and just did what he wanted, because that was easier. This was two years ago, he was my very first boyfriend and I’m now left unable to be near or even be touched by any man without tensing up and anxiety.",,
My nudes were spread by boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The things they said to justify spreading them were ‘girls should expect them to be spread if they send them. If they don’t want others to see they shouldn’t send them to anyone’ these same boys are now saying ‘not all men’ and ‘I wouldn’t be friends with anyone who harasses or assaults women’ everything is so normalised people don’t even see when they’re doing it themselves.,,
"I was constantly sexualised, told I looked like a porn star if I had glasses on, told i had ‘dick sucking lips’. I was harassed for nudes by someone I thought was my friend and then immediately dropped if I said no or labelled a ‘bitch’. I tried to take it like a joke as some of this came from my friends so I didn’t want them to deem me over sensitive but it was very uncomfortable. My ass would get slapped constantly and teachers were no help as they immediately said it was me flirting.One teacher even pulled me aside and said that I was too focused on boys and that I needed to refocus my priorities despite getting top grades in all my classes, not to mention that the attention I was getting was unwanted .",,
I was raped when I was 15 years old when I was heavily under the influence of alcohol. I was not conscious when it happened and did not realise it was rape until a few months after.,,
"I had to be reminded that this happened as there have been so many incidents that even some of the most shocking escape your mind. I was 15 with friends on the kings road. I am told by two boys who I have only just met that we should do some nos that they have. It is implied that this would be a quick affair and round the corner/near by. It’s not. We walk to the other end of kings road. They take me down a side road. They hand me a balloon. I think these are trustworthy people. One pushes me to the floor/pavement. The other is just watching. Then one gets on top of me, straddling me, and grinding on me pretending to have sex with me. I walk back afterwards to where everyone else is and pretend nothing happened, not even really realising anything bad had happened. These two boys both did other things to me on seperate occasions. One of which was burning a cigarette out on my stomach.",,
"I was in year 9, me and a boy who I knew fairly well and was in my friendship group were seeing each other/ exclusive. I’d never gone further with any boys and I had no intentions in doing so. I trusted this boy and didn’t think anything of it. One evening we were with a group of mates and he pulled me aside and asked me to give him a hand job. I replied no and said I didn’t know what I was doing and didn’t feel comfortable with it and he proceded to get his dick out and put my hand on his dick. Later that evening he asked me to give him a blowjob and after I said no more than 10 times, he took his pants off and pushed my head down, forcing me. After this he told my entire friendship group and others that it was shit head and he didn’t even Cum. I have to see this boy at social events as he’s still friends with my friends and to this day it haunts me that he got away with making me feel so worthless and used.",,
"A guy I went to [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with came back in a taxi with me to Halls after a night out. He’d forgotten his keys to his flat so he asked if he could come in to mine for a bit while he called his flat mate, who wasn’t answering his messages. I told him he should ring security, (who will let you in late at night if you’re locked out). He refused. I remember feeling very strong and able to say ‘well you’re not staying here.’ And he said ‘please, I’ll just sleep on the floor’. I then really felt like I was being uptight for not letting him just stay, I don’t know why. But I agreed. I said ‘but you have to stay on the floor!’ Of course when I was in bed (a single) he snuck in. I got him to get out and he came back. I got him to get out and he came back again. So I just gave in. Then the groping and the kissing started and I kept pushing him off but he kept on trying again and again even when I’d pretend to be asleep. At about 6 in the morning he managed to turn me round onto my back. And I got very annoyed and just said ‘fine this is what you want isn’t it,’ angrily letting him pull down my pants. He said ‘are you sure you want to do this’ and I remember clearly saying to him ‘no but I feel like you’re not going to give up trying’ and then he raped me. I wasn’t very experienced with sex and I just brushed it off. But I still think about it and it makes me feel so weird. I hate that it happened. I heard afterwards that he’d done it to another girl we knew. It was a known thing he did and nobody said anything to him or stopped being his friend. A year later my boyfriend at the time saw on a bathroom door his own name (‘EK’) written in a sentence: ‘EK’s girlfriend takes it from behind’. I just feel sure it was the guy who raped me who wrote that.",,
"At 14, I was at a small party (the first I ever went to where alcohol was available). All my friends were there and we got quite drunk, I passed out in a tent and woke up however long after with a boy, who was meant to be my friend, between my legs touching me. It’s quite a blur but has never left me, through therapy I have been able to understand how that situation (and the public ridicule and total lack of understanding I faced over the coming weeks of school) was the beginning of years of depression, the start of my anxiety which I still deal with now and a 7 year long eating disorder which I have only just been able to break free from. Not only are these situations traumatic at the time, but my life has been changed ever since. I am now 21 and still find the male figure and it’s presence in credibly hard to feel comfortable and safe around. Recently I was sexually abused again, by a university friend who was staying the night. We had kissed briefly in the evening leading up to it but I had changed my mind and clearly vocalised that to him, he didn’t want to hear it. In fact he was completely unable to hear anything I had to say, and created his own crazy narrative about how we have an ‘appreciation’ for each other. We did not. That night whilst I slept he continuously made passes at me and tried to touch (with success) whilst I lay next to him wishing I could run away or scream or do anything that would get him to stop. This event caused me to spiral, quite dramatically and my bulimia came back after I had made so much progress. I understand now that these two men have changed my life forever. This is rape culture. Silently asking my tutor if I could move out of his group rather than have him confronted by his mistakes is rape culture. The bullying and ridicule I faced at 15 after someone sexually assaulted me is rape culture."",I haven’t worn those jeans since.""",,
"I had known the boy who raped me since I was in year5 in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and he was in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He was my best friend I never thought he would hurt me. We drifted abit when he moved to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but it was [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] that raised him to be the boy he is, a rapist.",,
"There was no rape but it's around that culture, and odd behaviour from boys as I was growing up. In primary school I was kicked in the vagina by a boy in my year during a game. On my first induction day of high school (Year 6) an older boy approached me and my friend whilst sitting on a bench in the playground and said to me 'get your pants down and let's finish what we started', I had no idea who this boy was and all his mates were sniggering in the background. A few years later, in the same high school, there were rumours that the new boy in my year fancied me and wanted to go on a date, I agreed, the date never materialise but an onslaught on cruel, vicious jokes began at my expense for some reason. One day during a science class when the teacher was distracted the new boy in question approached me from behind, slammed his hands on my shoulders and with some focus began to squeeze, like a terrible massage! It hurt, and nothing was done about it!",,
The boys used to grab girls inappropriately with consent and this used to happen to me everyday,,
"I’m a member of staff - almost 40 - and on one sunny day I wore a knee length pencil skirt. A maintenance contractor wolf whistled at me as I walked past. I dismissed it at first but felt very self conscious the rest of the day. I was told by a senior manager that whilst action would be followed up with the contractor, I shouldn’t have worn clothes “inappropriately” to have attract the whistle in the first place. This senior manager was a woman.",,
we used to have two teachers who would come in to the girls locker rooms or try and look up girls skirts any chance they got luckily they were fired but it went on too long,,
"I was sexually assaulted by my best friend in the first week of school. She groped me in areas I have not even thought of being touched without my consent by anyone, this happened in front of one of my other friends who was also pressured into being groped just a few seconds after. I reported her to the school but she got away with it as somehow she managed to victimize herself when I had a witness and proof. I was then never brought justice as til this day she has a pretty decent reputation among students and no one has mentioned it and I am always told im “bringing up bad memories” and guilted into staying quiet. Along with this many people think I was making it up as it is an all girls school and it is not believable, I always feel scared when in the same room as her and I wish my school was confronted or she at least got suspended. This is not the only time as she had groped me before and I have a past of pressured sexual conversations/ actions with her. I hope no one who comes to the school thinks this is normal and I hope she understands her actions have consequences as she has not apologized and the school has covered it up amazingly.",,
"An older boy who I liked at the time asked me to sneak out to see him, I wasn’t particularly comfortable with this but he convinced me. I met up with him nervous and slightly uncomfortable, and ended up kissing him. He proceeded to assume I wanted to be fingered, and when I was uncomfortable with it I asked him to stop said no. Then multiple times after each time I’d said no he proceeded to try again until I gave in. After I left I felt very uncomfortable and woke up the next morning with bruising and cuts. I confronted him about it but he claimed he was very drunk.",,
I invited a [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boy over to mine when my family was at home. As soon as he stepped through the door he picked me up and pushed me on to my back on the rug in my living room and started taking off my pants. I kept saying stop and get off but he refused and he kept fingering me when I kept saying no.,,
"i was trying to do my french exam in year 9 and the kid next to me kept asking me for the answers. obviously i said no, this is for two reasons. 1) i was not good at french and 2) i didn’t wanna help a guy who was horrible to me. even though i said no to helping me he said he was gonna give me something if i gave him answers. i kept edging off my seat further away from him every time he whispered in my ear. he kept offering me kisses and hugs and chocolate. this alone made me feel dirty. then he put his hand on my knee. i couldn’t move. he moved it up and i felt paralysed. when he reached under my skirt and started to try and rip my tights is when i finally felt able to move. i shouted no and stood up but the supply teacher told me to shut up and sit down. i had to sit there for another hour. once the test was over i went straight to PE (for me this was with my head of year as i was on crutches) and told her what had happened. i cried my eyes out and she told me to wipe my eyes and go on with my day. she brushed me off as if nothing had ever happened. he was in 5 of my classes and i was on edge, felt dirt all day while there was still a hole in my tights. once i got home i broke down on my mum and told her everything that had happened, she immediately got furious and rang the school, but they pretended like i never reported it. i had an abusive father so i learnt to record every conversation where there is a serious topic or one that could turn to a confrontation. so i presented the recording to my mum and it made her even angrier. once we had calmed down she said i wasn’t going to school for the foreseeable future and invited my best friend and boyfriend (at the time) over for the evening as they went to different schools. we didn’t tell them what had happened till 4 months later but they knew i had a bad day. the next day after i dropped my younger brother to school with my mum we went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and waited for a member of the SLT to come talk to us. lucky for me it was my history teacher. we showed her everything from the recording to my ripped tights and she was angry too. i see that she wanted him gone. the head decided that the appropriate action was to say that because the boy had only came to england 2 years ago that he does not know the proper ways to treat a girl. and i called bull on it. they got a translator to translate to afrikaans but he was still in all my lessons till year 11 (when i left). he gave me smirks everytime he saw me and each time i wanted to cry. he knew what he did and he wasn’t sorry. one day in french again we had another supply, as i had finished my work he asked me to help someone else. i said yes but when he asked me to sit next to that boy i said no. and everyone called me a racist. i stormed out leaving all my stuff in there and ran to my history teachers class room. she wasn’t there but the other teacher let me sit there on the computer and do work. my friend brang me my bag and i told her why i did that and she made sure everyone knew i wasn’t a racist. this happened again and again untill i left. one teacher had found out what happened and kicked him out the class and refused to teach him. it was a bit extreme but i loved the support i got from him. to this day i feel dirty when i think about it and o can’t have people whisper in my right ear or touch my right thigh. it’s been 5 years and i don’t think i’ll ever recover.",,
"I’ve been sexually harassed and assaulted for years now, from being catcalled at 13 to still getting shouted at in the streets now that I’m 19. I lost my virginity unwillingly to my at the time boyfriend (and rapist) when I was barely 15. I’ve been manipulated into many sexual acts, been told I owed them, been recorded against my will, harassed for nudes and been groped by multiple boys (at the time my peers, what made this worse was it was talked about openly and even joked about with my boyfriend.) For years I thought my abusive relationship was normal, I thought it was normal to be groped in front of his mates, to have my intimate photos shared. I left my first abusive relationship for another, when I tried to speak out I was told by other girls that I should be careful using the R word because it probably didn’t happen because I was in a relationship with him at the time and I could ruin his life. For years I was controlled, for years I was told it was my fault. I still have nightmares, I still have issues being intimate, I still feel unclean, I still feel like I owe men my body and that it’s my duty to do what they say when I say. I will never forget how my innocence was taken from me far too soon, and against my will.",,
I was 4 years old my cousins wife’s brother at the time raped me. He was 16 I remember him telling me to touch his parts and I didn’t know any better. Then he touched me and kept doing it until he raped me. I don’t understand why he did it but I feel it’s important to tell people about it because it’s hurt me so bad since I started remembering more about what happened,,
my little sister who was 8 was fucking sexually assaulted by another kid in her grade and they didn’t do anything about it for hours until the end of the day. it was on the news and then brushed over like it never happened.,,
"I got drunk with male friends who outnumbered my female friends. There were 3 of us female and many more male. One of those boys convinced the girls, specifically me to drink first. This boy had been obsessive over me and liked me a while before this but that was more reason to trust myself with him, or so I thought, due to the fact I believed he wouldn't want to hurt me or let anyone else hurt me. I was so wrong. I was drunk but aware for 1 hour of the 4 and a half hours I was out there getting drunk, I was completely black out and consistently passing out, waking up and then passing out again. I came to school the next day to learn that, the male friend who had liked me for years, had sex with me while I was in my blackout/passing out state. According to the only girl out of 3 of us, who didn't get blackout, she saw him have sex with me. She said she was shocked and left to be somewhere else so she couldn't tell me anything more but she said I was apparent to be knocked out. I was completely silent and limp, he had carried me to a separate place and told everyone to leave me and him alone. They were drunk so thought nothing of it apart from the girl who caught him and told me. I lost my friends that day, he was cheered on. Having been in a relationship around a year from then, where I was raped pretty much everyday for 7 months, I was distraught and had panic attack after panic attack when I found out. Two girls came to where I was when i finally came to, on that day I woke up with my top barely covering my boobs, my jeans unzipped and messily pulled over me, dirt all over me, pain and soreness in between my legs and in my genital area. I heard the sound of those girls screaming at the boy who had sex with me, they were calling him ""disgusting"", ""cruel"" and telling him he was never allowed near me again and also that he should die for what he did. He was also admittedly completely sober and waiting for that moment that he could rape me. I was raped and to this day I have never said that it was rape. It got round school and reached a couple teachers, the only response I had from teachers was I was called in once and told to ""just refrain from talking about it anymore, keep it to yourself because you're just going to make this school look bad and if you do that, you'll have to leave. Would your parents want that?"". This teacher knew my parents were abusive due to her having past pastoral care sessions with me when I was younger. That moment was almost as bad as the rape.",,
"I moved to a new school in my last year of secondary school, and the head teacher would ( without your consent) open you blazer to “check if your jumper was tooked in to your skirt as it was not allowed. It mad all the girls feel uncomfortable as it was only them who he would check, however most of the boy could walk around with multicoloured jumpers and not be told about them",,
"""I was 16 and the boy I was talking to at the time (18) offered to pick me up from a festival because of the rain and I accepted. I was drunk and high and he took advantage of me after taking me back to his.,""I do not remember the details of having sex with him nor how it started or if he was using protection but unfortunately I didn’t see this as a problem at the time, thinking it was normal to be in a situation like that. He made me feel lucky to have done that with him and promised me he’d make it up to me as he knew that’s not how I wanted to lose my virginity.,""After a few days and reality kicking in I told him that I didn’t remember what happened and, instead of telling me like I thought he would, he immediately blocked me saying that I was wrongly accusing him of raping me and refused to tell me the details of what happened. He called me horrible names and a liar. I hid this away from my friends and famil until telling my closest friend a month afterwards and she informed me that this was rape. Yet I still denied that that was true.,""Submitting this story is my way of finally taking back some power. It makes me so mad that I was the one who felt ashamed and in the wrong and it was me who avoided places he could be, not the other way around. I was silenced but now I speak 🗣 and I thank the courage of other women that have spoken out and inspired me to do the same.""",,
"I was spiked at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I do not remember any of the night at all but my friends where luckily with me the whole time. I didn’t have any drinks outside my own home (Which was one drink). I was taken in an ambulance to a and e. I told the staff there and the police the next morning that I had been spiked and that it was by a needle as my neck was sore and I had no drinks. I felt as though they did not believe me and thought that I was just going off “rumours on social media”. I have now, three days later, had to go to a sexual health clinic and ask if they can do some tests and potentially get a hepatitis vaccine. They have not got back to me yet but I am hoping I can get rested ASAP.",,
"I met an older guy in the summer of [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was 19 and he was 27 but because we worked together and spent so much time around each other I didn’t feel that the age gap affected our relationship. We were having sex one day and I noticed that he was looking off to the side and when I turned I saw that he was filming us. I stopped and asked him what the fuck he thought he was doing, I hadn’t been asked to film and I had not given consent. He couldn’t see what the issue was as we were going out and he was only filming so he could watch it back later. I was so shocked I didn’t know how to react. The relationship continued for a few more months but I wish I had ended things that day, I think I was just so confused and shocked that someone I trusted would do something like that and I didn’t really process my feelings for a long time after. I’m now 21 nearly 22 and I still think about what I should have done differently, when in fact I didn’t do anything wrong and he was the one to betray my trust . He really made me doubt myself as for a long time I struggled with the fact that I had not been strong enough to end it that day, and to this day my self esteem and image of myself has been altered because of him.",,
I was groomed when i was 12 by a 16 year old and havent told any of my closest friends and its been four years and ive been repressing it for so long that it doesnt feel like it should matter anymore but it does and it still affects me every day because i feel like it was my fault,,
"I was 14 years old and a friends boyfriend text me to meet up and share a cigarette. We met at some garages near my house and we’re laughing and joking whilst we smoked. It started to rain and he said we should go and sit inside one of the garages. As we sat together he turned to me, held me down and raped me. When I clearly said no he told me he’d tell everyone at school that I had anyway so I might as well. I told my best friend the next day and she told me he had already told everyone I’d slept with him and they I was a little slut I’d enjoyed it so much.",,
When I was 12 years old I attended a 13th birthday party. Throughout the night the boys proceeded to run around groping girls and laughing about it. On my ways to the toilet I was pushed up against the wall by my assaulted where we continued to try and forcefully finger me through my clothes. I ran away to the toilets and one girl immediately asked if I was okay after seeing the events take place. I blocked it out in fear of what had actually happened. I told a guy I had a crush on who was also his friend and he told me it wasn’t a big deal and if I didn’t report it I didn’t get to complain about it. I was still very much a child. These groupings were normalised at these parties for years onwards and even praised and encouraged amongst the men of my year group.,,
"He was in quite a famous band in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] years ago and we were all on a night out, me and his band mate clearly liked eachother and were flirting all night, everyone got drunk and the band invited me and my friend back to for a house party. It was only the whole band and us 2 girls so everyone began going to bed, my friend went to crash in a spare bedroom with a single bed hammered, the guy I liked went to his room but said I was welcome to stay in his room if I wanted and everyone heard this and knew we liked eachother. He had his door wide open with music playing but when I came out the bathroom to go to him his bandmate ushers me into his room saying he needs to tell me something. He shuts the door behind him and starts saying that guys a dickhead etc, and showing me all his creepy writings all over his walls, I got scared straight away but was drunk and wanted to be polite and thought the other guy would come looking for me soon. I kept asking why is he? But wouldn’t answer, next thing I know I’m lying on his bed and don’t know where I am, he had taken my shoes off and his hands are inside me. I continuously say no but was so wasted I couldnt move or even push him off and it seemed to egg him on more and he climbed on top of me. I cried the whole time he raped me. I remember when I woke up I snook out the room and tried to wake up my friend but she was too wasted so I climbed in the single bed with her and lay there wide awake listening for him until she woke up, I made an excuse to leave early and he had left my shoes outside the door. The weeks following he bragged to everyone that we slept together and I denied it and told everyone he was lying but never told anyone the truth, and everyone including my girlfriend would just called me a liar and asked why I’m so easy etc. Of course the guy I liked believed him and never spoke to me again. The fact that he did it with the risk of his bandmate walking in any second and probably did it just to get one up over him sickens me. To this day I still have nightmares about the way his skin felt when I was trying to scratch him because I couldn’t even lift my arms",,
I was seeing a guy when I was 17 and woke up in the night with him inside me. I had no concept at the time at how fucked this is and it’s taken another woman to come forward about him to fully acknowledge what it was. He was a good friend.,,
"I was at a party in halls and I ended up being persuaded back to my room with a boy I had met in the corridor. He had had quite a lot to drink and was very forward about wanting to do stuff with me and I also was too drunk for any of it to be truly consensual. We ended up having sex because I felt like I had to give him what he wanted, He was quite rough but when I tried getting him to stop I had to explicitly ask several times before he eventually did. After that he was still reluctant to redress himself and kept asking if I wanted to have sex again. When I said no and asked him to leave he refused and kept trying to kiss me and feel me up and said he wanted to see me again. Each time I tried to pull away he'd try to grab hold of me and acted all sad to the effect that I felt bad about not reciprocating. Eventually I managed to get him out by literally dragging him out the door. Again he acted really sad about this which made me feel like the guilty one for a while after despite what had happened. Even now I feel like I can't talk about it considering the amount of time that has passed since. Plus I'm not actually into guys so I'm scared people won't take it seriously or equate my homosexuality to me simply associating men with the bad experiences that I've had with them in the past.",,
I was touched by my classmates as part of there own game all because they thought it was fun to do.,,
Sexually assaulted everyday in primary school,,
"Between year eight and year 11 there were multiple occasions where myself and many other girls were sexually assaulted even if we didn’t know it. I myself had reported one account of assault in year eight where a boy decided to run up to me and grab my breasts, there were no consequences for him and it felt like a major defeat. After this I no longer reported these incidents such as when I would be smacked on the bum in lessons as well as a boy who bent me over a table to push himself against me. There were also boys who were subject of sexual harassment as well as girls, this harassment coming from male and female teachers who would comment on our weight and how it made us look in clothes if they were tighter fitting as well as asking students to remove items of clothing to expose their underwear to see if it complied with school rules.",,
I was touched in a sexual way in 7th grade and it was weird since i am a boy and i don’t want any girl to go through that. It wasn’t playing around he did it on purpose and he would tend to do it to a ton of people.,,
I was 14 at the time and he was 17 he is my brothers friend and would constantly compliment me on my body and when our families would meet up he’d hug me and grope me. And when I’d leave he’d message me asking for me to send pictures of my body and manipulated me into trusting him. If I said no he’d threaten me and say he would send my pictures to people. He made me say things I didn’t want to and sent me pictures of him I didn’t want. One time he came to my house to see my brother and he kept trying to get me go to another room with him so he could kiss me and touch me. I kept saying no and he kept on getting aggressive with me.The next morning he waited for me to leave my room and followed me down to the kitchen where I was alone. He is someone I have grown up with who I thought I could trust.,,
one night i was at a party and a guy was touching me and i was extremely uncomfortable and told him i didnt want it and i was tipsy as i was drinking.,,
"When I was in year 8 I remember a boy who walked past me in school say ""nice t*ts"" at me for no reason he just walked right past me and carried on walking and laughing. I felt so upset and embarrassed that I cried. I told the behaviour team at my school and as far as I know nothing happened too him. I'm now In year 10 and rumours have been said that he's been doing much worse things too girls at my school and I still think he hasn't been talked too.",,
"A boy who was familiar with drugs took advantage of Me the first time I took them. He had sex with me and I was too fucked to say no, he also took the condom off without asking. I acted like nothing happened until the end of summer. My whole year found out. People treated it like gossip and still bring it up to this day. It made me question myself and think I was a liar. This in turn left me with suicidal thoughts. The people who loved to gossip dont know that I can’t sleep most nights thinking about it for the past 3 years. They still welcomed him back into the friendship group with open arms knowing what happened.",,
I don’t want to talk about it. I just want to mention that it happened at the hands of the university,,
"I was 12. He would say I had an amazing body and he’d love to take my virginity. He did, when he raped me on my 13 birthday then told everyone I had already lost it to a different man in his 20s. And talked down on my body for years. He would talk about how I always wanted it but I never did. Even before then kids had gone around saying I had done things to them bragging about it like I was some kind of rookie card.",,
I currently go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. A sixthform who actively encourages rape culture within school. A specific teacher has told us that if we carry on wearing what we are wearing and get sexually assaulted it is our fault. She also made comments generally about how short our skirt was saying it was the length of her knickers and how we were setting bad examples to younger years due to our tops. As a result of this the school protected the teacher and continued to blame the girls effectively agreeing with what had been said. Not once did they ask us about our own emotional well-being and continued to send male teachers to confront us aggressively on the situation. There have also been times at the lower school when in pe we were told by our male teacher that we should ‘slut drop’ and bounce as he recorded us.,,
"Since recently leaving school, I reconnected with an old friend and we often got onto the topic of boys and our experiences with them at school. I remember opening up about the time a boy i had started seeing had often gotten his penis out in public to try and make me do stuff and had locked me in his house and tried to force me to do sexual things I didn't want to do. At the time the police were contacted but did nothing at all, to the point I don't even think they spoke to him. I still had to see him every day, sit in front of him in lessons and generally feel unsafe in school. The more time that passes since the incident, the more I am struggling with it. I later found out that the same person had sent unsolicited dick pics to nearly every single girl in my year group and probably beyond. A few years later I was groped by a childhood friend in a classroom, no teacher was present but at the time this person thought that was okay - there has never been any sort of sexual relationship between us and nothing to justify this. This past year I have been beeped at or shouted at when I've been out for a walk alone more times than not, no matter what time of day it is. When I was 12, a boy who was 14 or 15 at the time hassled me to the point I asked my friend to come with me where he was so I didn't have to do it alone. I know countless stories from other girls who have experienced similar things to me and we are 16. The boys in my year group were allowed to get away with it all. ,When I went to report my own assault I was reluctant to say who it was and the member of staff told me that some pupils don't realise what they are doing is wrong which could explain it so if I told them who it was we could figure out if they meant it or not. What I gathered from that is that there is an amount of pupils that have a history of doing this sort of thing and that makes it okay?,Casual sexual assault has been normalised in that school and it is not okay.",,
"I was visiting some friends at uni and we went clubbing. Was very drunk and went back with this guy. Made out etc was consensual, however, he then started pulling down my jeans to which I told him to stop and I continuously tried pulling them back up again. I tried multiple times, however, as I was really drunk and significantly weaker than he was, he eventually won. He then started to fi**r me and do other things to which I kept trying to tell him to stop, to which he only responded with “I’m pleasuring you so you have to do it back” and continued what he was doing. I then blacked out and found out later that my friend had to come get me but found me with my jeans completely done up. She closed the door behind her as immediately knew something was wrong. The guy then started pounding on the door yelling that he did nothing wrong and to open the door immediately. She thought he was going to physically hurt her. Still don’t fully know what happened to me after I blacked out.",,
"I was sexually, mentally and physically abused by a girl and nobody (not even police) believed me. We were 11/12 y.o. and I think she was being abused herself. Still doesn’t excuse the behaviour that has scarred me for over 10 years.",,
I was 15 and on my way back from school on a dark evening after sport. The bus was on a divergence and so stopped at the top of a dimly lit hill which was slightly further away from the centre of town than usual. I had noticed this man hovering around the stop but didn’t take much notice. It was rainy and slippery so I was conscious of where I placed my feet and as I looked at the ground I noticed a shadow immediately behind me. I sped up only to find that it didn’t go away. What made it even more terrifying was passing alleyways and dark patches thinking what would happen if this person pushed me into one of them. I finally reached the bottom of the hill and relaxed as it was busy and familiar but was met with a firm hand grabbing between my legs. I screamed but no one even looked up. The most disturbing thing is this man muttered a ‘sorry’ and walked off as if he had bumped into me. I was left feeling disgusted with myself.,,
"I was part of a group of boys who were all supposed to be our “friends”. We grew up together and spent out years, as girls, being openly compared to other local girls schools and judged for how “easy” or “frigid” we were. My boyfriend at the time turned aggressive when in front of his mates. It was clearly a mans world and we were expected to accept it. When he cheated - I was called a “drama Queen” for walking away. What did I expect? He didn’t want to wait for me to ‘put out’. Eventually we had sex. When I didn’t bleed I was told I was a slut as clearly I “didn’t break”. Our relationship developed. We were together long past school but when around friends he became aggressive, all the while looking for approval. Our bodies were rated and they still, to this day, have a “boys whatsapp” where they discuss, share and rate girls they have been with. My lack of trust with men goes way deeper than this. Being forced to have sex to stay in a relationship was the least of my worries compared to what some of my friends when through.",,
"When it happened i was 16 and a virgin, he was 19 or 20. I went to a small house party with a few friends and was drinking, the boys were giving us shots and we were listening to music. I was supposed to stay at my friends but as we were drinking lots she said we should just stay at the boys house where the party was, so we did. As the night went on i ended up being black out drunk and all I remember was waking up to the boys brother on top of me, I wasn’t awake nor sober to give consent, but when i awoken to this I didn’t know how to stop it at this point so i just laid there. After the incident i felt sick and guilty about it, it wasn’t until weeks later that I actually identified it as rape because i felt like my experience wasn’t ‘that bad’ or valid, i felt like an attention seeker to call it that, but i know now that it was in fact rape and the memory still lives in my head over and over.",,
In the summer after 5th grade i walked to my boyfriends friends house. His friend was at the park so we were there alone. He started to touch my stomach and made his way up into my shirt. When i tried to push him off he he held me down and raped me. This continued for months. Then his friend came home early and stopped him. I never got my justice.,,
"At school, I had this person who was completely obsessed with me and for some unknown reason he kept on touching my arse. I asked him to stop but he didn’t. Luckily this doesn’t happen anymore but I really believe no one should have to go through this.",,
I was stripped naked by a teacher at school. Bizarrely I feel I dodged a bullet because the teacher subsequently was arrested and jailed for sexual abuse towards another boy. Myself and my mates had suspicions of a pedophile ring at the school. The school vicar had relationships with boys. Who knows if they were consensual or not but most people knew you could get free alcohol at his house. He also said in his history lesson to pupils 'one up the bum no harm done' . One teacher who lived in the boarding house would massage your shoulders and nuzzle his chin into the top of your head. The head of the junior school bording house was seen by 6 boys with his hands under a boys duvet late at night. The schools reponse after the boys came forward was to drag their parents into school and in front of them threaten the pupils with expulsion. The Vicar is still part of the church and the teacher who was jailed is still teaching. As years go by I feel more and more guilty for not speaking out as I worry that the abuse by these men could have cariried on and hurt more kids.,,
"I was 15 and so was he but it was a lot stronger than I was and manipulative. He was going out with a close friend of mine and I was helping him with his mental health and giving him support I’d had known him for 6 years and been friends but it wasn’t until then we became closer. After helping him with his mental health for a long time he started getting very close and sitting on me or ‘accidentally’ touching me but I thought nothing of it. We would go into town and meet up and this is when he started pushing me against walls away from the eyes of anyone else in public and what put his hands under my top and down my trousers and would force my hand into his trousers to ‘’please’ him. He began to beg for pictures and started threatening and blackmailing me or he would tell, this was his way of saying thank you for everything I’d don’t until he forced me into a public toilet and raped me for the first time and left me in tears, for nearly 3 months this went on and he would threaten me into going to his house to assault me and rape me for his pleasure multiple times until he was tired, bored or had enough and send me on my way again, until he got me pregnant and I miscarried which made him mad. Then I broke, and confused to someone I trusted what had happened and was happening. I still had to sit in a class with him, scared to walk the same hallways alone knowing he was there until he was asked to leave months after it all came out, I went to the place not for me but to protect anyone else. That’s when I found out I wasn’t the only cause there was multiple others but his manipulation got him out of all of it and non of us ever got justice, 3 years on and I’m still afraid I’ll pass him even though I’m stronger mentally and physically now it worries me how many others he must have hurt by now and It breaks me anyone else should have to to endure that pain or him. But he will be caught because he’s smug about it but for anyone who has delay with this we stand together and will be stronger, as survivors and as our own person!",,
my sister placed her hands on my breast,,
"A super famous and good looking senior (19y/o) of mine asked me (15y/o) out, obviously i agreed to go out with him because everyone would kill to go out with him. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking it would just be a casual date watching movies together in the theatre. Little did I know, it was the worst day of my life. Although the theatre had only a few people he insisted to sit at a more quiet and far away from anyone else seatings. I didn’t think twice and went along. A little while later he began to put his hands around me i asked what are u doing? he then said oh this is normal to do during a date so i went along because i didn’t know what to do. Just within a few minutes he began to lean on me for a kiss i pushed him off but it didn’t stop him he kept pushing forward so i had to give in. He wanted more and more. He slipped his fingers into my pants trying to get beneath my panty I said no because I was having period, he said it doesn’t matter to him… Not only did he do that, he forced my hands down his dick and asked me rub it I was so lost and scared at that time so i went along with it.. After i went home he texted me asking me to be his FWB .. i then blocked him everywhere..",,
"When I was 15 a boy in upper sixth would come into my room often, one night he got into my bed I fell asleep and woke with his hands down my underwear. I was frozen so tried to pretend I didn’t wake up and sort of pretended to naturally wake up and went to use the loo. I didn’t tell anyone I was so scared this guy was in the opposite dormitory to me was older and had mental problems I was worried that if he knew that I knew what he’d done that he would go mental I genuinely feared for my life because of his problems. After 7-8 months of him repeatedly coming into my room 1-2 times a week, and being so scared when I’d here his door open,I decided to tell someone which ended up being the biggest regret of my life so far. The school especially the headmaster completely failed in protecting me. He was kept in the room opposite me for another few days after I told someone as I was so scared and couldn’t sleep. The school refused to go the police until my parents eventually did . I was offered little to no support from the school and have had to experience jokes from pupils and teachers about it regularly. Not an hour in the day goes by where I don’t think about what happened and how much I wish I didn’t tell anyone as exactly what u feared would happen if people knew did happen. The headmaster showed no sympathy towards me but yet the perpetrator received much sympathy by the headmaster not so much by the pupils. Especially as a boy it has been hard as there are no other men i know that I can relate to or talk to about it. And the headmaster told us that nothing like this had happened at the school from reading these testimonies that is clearly not true. This led to depression, I don’t sleep at night I have nightmares there’s no one I feel I can talk to and what happened has destroyed my life not just the actual event but the aftermath of telling someone. I contemplate my life on a daily basis and have to still walk around school seeing the headmaster which is painful. The way the school dealt with it was appalling it has certainly ruined my life and everyday I hate myself for what happened I know I can’t change it but there is no support for me at the school and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.",,
I was 16 at a birthday party in the country. I was drunk to the point I couldn’t stand on my own properly. A girl propped me up and led me to behind a tent where the boy who’s birthday it was was waiting in the dark. She let me go and I fell to the ground and she said “you’re welcome” to the boy and walked away. He tried to sexually assault me. I managed to get away.,,
I got sexually assaulted at my school and they did nothing to help and i have to suffer with my sexual assulter staring at me and being in the classroom i got assaulted in,,
"My ex boyfriend was a narcissist and extremely controlling. At first I was blinded by love. It was only when I ended the relationship, after 18 months, that I realised how aggressive, controlling and violent our sex lives had been. Not once did I enjoy having sex with him, as I always ended up hurt in some way, but at the time I just went along with it. He never asked me if I was okay with what he was doing, he never once asked me if I enjoyed it, he never once questioned why I would cry or go quiet for hours afterwards.",,
"Also maybe he shouldn't have dated me in the first place. I mean i was under age but where I come from that's kinda normalized.""",,
I was in year 7 and a boy from year 10 had been messaging me on social media sending nudes and and trying to get me to send nudes but he said I had to keep it between us 2. I didn’t send. Then he forced me into an empty classroom at lunch break and tried to force me into having sex with him. I reported him to my tutor. Nothing was done.,,
My butt along with many other girls was smacked or grabbed throughout the year by one individual at the school. Despite telling teachers nothing happened and the common phrase of “boys will be boys” was used.,,
"This lad tried to touch me on the lady area in a class with the whole class watching and I've already been sexually harassed by a different guy in the same school, the lad who did this in class got the whole lads laughing and made years rolling down my eyes and I tried to tell the teacher but I didn't have the effort to, this lad made me feel so out down all day and still has now I see him everyday and still now no teachers know",,
One of my best friends is so persistent with girls. I now can realise how bad it is we are all just always excuse his behaviour and say hes just like that because hes so funny and great in the day. Not acceptable and regret not being more firm with him already,,
He grabbed me and i said no and kept moving his hand away but he kept moving it back no teacher was in the room only students they saw and made jokes telling me “ I was gonna get some dick” and other inappropriate jokes about the whole situation. I said no. And he still did it. Even when I moved his hand away he would tell me to let him do it. I said no.,,
"The first sexual encounter I had with a boy ended in me being forced to do everything with them apart from sex. I had just gone to sixth form and met a group of boys I didn’t really know on a night out who were from another school in my city. I started speaking to one of them, but on a night out his friend spiked my drink and kissed me, then tried to make me get a cab home with him but my friends intervened and took me home. I was asleep for like 5 days after that, I thought it was a come down from drugs (I had taken MDMA that night and it was one of the first times I’d taken it). The boy kept messaging me, and being naive and young, having little experience with boys I was flattered by the attention as he was considered cool and good looking. A few weird things followed- him turning up at my friends houses when I was there uninvited (they didn’t know him at all) and getting kicked out of clubs for not buying tickets or having ID (we were 16) and he’d wait outside for me until 4am without my knowledge, he’d been kicked out at like 10pm. We ended up becoming friends, and spending a decent amount of time together so I stopped thinking he was weird. He came to my house after a night out, after we kissed he tried to get me to do stuff with him and when I refused. he left and sent me loads of angry texts questioning if I’d ever done stuff with anyone, that it was so embarrassing if I hadn’t etc etc. I then went to his house and he fingered me (with my consent) and I stayed over. I was ridiculously drunk that night so I didn’t remember much of it. The next time he came to my house, and engaged in an argument with my older sister about how young girls posting nudes on insta should be okay. I was in a bad mood, ended up going to bed at like 5am. The next part is hard to talk about so I don’t want to go into much detail but he tried to do stuff with me and when I refused, took my underwear off, picked me up and placed me on his head holding my legs down and trying to make me do 69. I refused and managed to get off, then he did a count down moving his head under the covers while I said no repeatedly and sexually assaulted me again. He then asked me to give him a blowjob, I begged not to and he said I had to do something back, I did it for about 5 seconds and then said I had cramp and turned away. He then said I wasn’t ready for sex yet and that I was too tight but we would do it soon. That same night he told me he had spiked me on the night out when we first kissed as a ‘joke’ then denied it and said it was another girl who he knew did it and not him. I just went to sleep, the next day was really awkward and my mum drove him home not having a clue what happened. I then found out from the first time I stayed at his and he fingered me that he had videoed himself engaging in a sex act with me and sent it to all his friends. (I didn’t know this video even existed). My sisters friend told me because her boyfriend at the time was friends with him. He and another boy made him delete the video but tbh I don’t know if it’s still out there or what. Things then ended with him and I quickly moved on and got a boyfriend. Once we broke up the boy who sexually assaulted me started harassing me, trying to meet up and sending me explicit videos and stalking me on nights out, following me and a friend down roads etc. When I finally told people what happened he started calling me a liar, accusing me of attention seeking and his friends were horrible to me too. Since going to uni everyone was still friends with him, one of my best boy friends and my new boyfriends best friend was best friends with him. In my boyfriends uni house I had to deal with pictures being displayed of him because others in the house were friends with him. Baring in mind at this point I’d moved from Manchester to london and I still had to deal with seeing him everywhere. My boyfriend was friendly with him until recently which I found really hard too. Everyone would talk to him and invite him everywhere, while knowing we were in a constant argument over what had happened. Finally now people have realised what he is like and stopped being friends with him but I told people a long time ago and it was ignored, I told a boy I was seeing at one point and he didn’t care, he only cared when his new girlfriend was raped by him. I had to deal with 4 years of every night out I went on him being there, festivals, even staying over at my friends house in leeds hed be there. Everyone knew what I’d said about him as well and either didn’t believe me or didn’t care, until it got so out of hand that he was doing it to girls on nights out and it couldn’t be denied. For me it happened 5 years ago and took 4 years until people finally stopped being friends with him and some people still probably are. His friend apologised to me a year ago and told me he believed what I had said but that’s the only apology or recognition I have received.",,
"A friend I knew since highschool pushed me down and forced himself on top of me. He aggressively kissed me and groped me under my top. I always think about how lucky I was to get away from him before it escalated any further, but because I 'escaped' I always diminished what I went through and told myself I was never assaulted. I understand now that I was and I am allowing myself to recover and grieve over the experience. He is still friends with some of my friends to this day.",,
I was raped in school by a “friend” in the ladies bathrooms after he snuck in after me and he wouldn’t let me go after grabbing me by the throat and undressing me whilst i. screamed for him to get off,,
"I was around 18 and living in accommodation where there were about 10 bedrooms each with 3 or 4 people sharing. One night a friend and I started to watch a film together on his bed in his shared room. As I started to fall asleep he began to touch me, I didn't know what to do so I just pretended to be asleep. This all happened with multiple people in the room (although I don't believe they knew what was happening). I felt so ashamed but I came so at the time I thought it must be ok.",,
"In year 8 boys would play games in lessons daring eachother to slap a girls bum, and the girls would be shocked but powerless. A male teacher humiliated a speaker who came in to speak about toxic masculinity, and boys cheered him on, calling him a lad. The staff present did nothing, and later apologised to the speaker in private, where the boys couldn’t see what was okay or not and thought the response was accepted. I’ve been called the biggest slut in the class relentlessly in year 8 before people knew what it meant! and by boys who didn’t even know me. Boys looking up teachers skirts, female teachers saying they are “ashamed” to come into school to see girls with skirts as they are. Such a disappointing response- the guys who have stood up for this cause have been called bent and wet, or saying “guys get it too” as a defence for not supporting, or even saying it is an act of feminism as if that’s a bad thing. School have responded to all of this saying they already have the curriculum in place and staff are trained, yet all of the above suggests otherwise? We were told off in the younger years for saying all kinds of derogatory slang, but never slut, whore - any of this. I’m so upset to hear some of my guy friends signing specifically with their friends to make sure they don’t seem like they did this by themselves, and some making jokes about it. That’s so sad",,
"I was a senior in college, he was a few years older than me. I was coming home from a party, I had one too many drinks. He invited me over. I thought it’d be okay because he had never made a pass at me before. We were just hanging out at first and then I started to get tired. I was borderline asleep and he kept telling me to relax as he tried touching me. I told him to stop multiple times and he told me it would be okay. That’s when he pulled down his pants and said it was going to be just the tip. In the morning, he asked me if we had sex. I said it was sex, but I didn’t remember much. He said that it was just the tip and I couldn’t remember so it doesn’t count as sex. At first, I didn’t think of it as rape because I couldn’t remember much. But the more I talked to a friend of mine about it, I realized it was rape because I kept telling him to stop and I was intoxicated to the point where I could not have consented.",,
"A guy who had previously treated me poorly (sleeping with me and then not talking to me afterwards) started making advances on me at a party. I was pretty adamant that it wasn’t happening and said as much to him but as I got drunker and he continued trying to get with me I succumbed and went to bed with him. The next morning, when I woke up, he was having sex with me. I completely froze and couldn’t say anything to tell him to stop. Once he finished he went back to sleep and I, feeling pretty upset, went upstairs to tell our mutual friend (also someone I deemed a very good friend of mine). He told me I was making a very serious allegation and I shouldn’t say something like that lightly. For the rest of the day the guy hardly spoke to me which made me feel even more stupid and insecure about the situation and my friend has since reprimanded me again for simply telling him what happened which makes me doubt my own experiences.",,
When I was in Y10 I was having lunch with some guys in my year and my sister (Y7) walked past. I said hi to her but went back to my conversation with these guys. One of them (Y10) started talking about how much he would like to fuck and rape my sister and all of the other guys on the table laughed along and made comments about her body. I remember feeling very uncomfortable and the way they were talking about my sister made me feel scared and sick. The guy who made these comments continued to make jokes about raping my sister to me in the coming months.,,
"I have been fat shamed at this school, asked inappropriate questions, touched by other people, and I don’t think it’s okay that the teacher don’t care. I need my voice to be heard and speak on behalf of others.",,
"I was at lunch with 4 friends when me and one of my friends needed the toilet when as we were walking there a boy who I liked at the time invited me to a party I decided to go.Later on at the party a unknown boy who I believe was in S5/6 pressured me into having sex with him then the next day at school he told all his friends and they told people and so on and then people called me a slag,whore,slut ext this made me feel like it was my fault when in reality it wasn’t,I avoided telling my family and my 4 closest friends until recently due to this I was in S3 when this happened I’m now in S4 so this was nearly a year ago",,
"I was 18, freshly starting university and had made close friends with a boy who had strong feelings for me, after a night in the club he came back to mine where I swiftly fell asleep due to being both drunk and tired - he proceeded to get on top of me and inside me as I feel asleep, I don’t know whether he stopped once I was.",,
"Once at a party, I knew this boy for a long time because I thought we were always friends. However, this night he tried to get me alone all night and kept trying to kiss me, I was pushing him away saying no but he carried on. His friend came up to him and said “make sure you fuck her, I’ve got condoms here get her in the bathroom”. He said this to his friend right infront of me. I was gobsmacked and couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Yet again, he carried on trying to harass me and in the end, I had to leave. Another time, I was at a club in town when some guy by me came up behind me and started feeling me. I kept moving his hands and he was grabbing my breasts and bum infront of everyone. I felt so uncomfortable and was asking my friend to help me. All his friends were watching and even one of them who is my good friend came up to me and said like are you okay, stay by me. Even the guys at my school have made a type of ‘Burn Book’ and they write about things they have done to girls and they give themselves ‘points’ like it’s all a joke. There was some guy I was serious with for quite a while, we got on quite well and he messed me around for a while and was never honest with me. He only wanted to know me when he wanted one thing. I was at my friends party at an apartment and he came with his friends. I got so drunk because I was trying to distract myself from him. In the end, my friends helped me get into bed, and shut the door behind me. Knowing I was there, he came in whilst I was half asleep and started having sex when I barely knew what was going on. Even though I allowed it, I felt vulnerable and uncomfortable because I was confused. Right after it, he left and went home. I still think about this every day and what I could have done to stop it. Another time, I was walking home with my dog from the park. These guys on bikes were in my path so I had to walk round them. As I moved around them I got to the end of the pathway and they followed me. They kept shouting things to me like “hey, what’s your name?” And he came right in my face and was insisting on my name. However, I carried on walking and ignored him, but he kept persisting and following me. He got in my face and was saying “are you just gonna blank me, yeah? You’re horrible you aren’t ye”. He was with all his mates, I was terrified on my own, they were all laughing whilst he was in my face. I was at a family party and some guy was there, on my way home he seen me walking woth no shoes on because my heels were hurting that bad. He said he will give me a lift home and so I believed him. He got to my house and instead of slowing down, he sped up and said “you are coming to mine”. I said “no I don’t want to can you let me out?” However he locked the doors and carried on driving to his house. I kept saying take me home., then he starting trying to comfort me by saying if I just go to his for 10 minutes he will drop me off home soon. Of course, I believed him when he said this and he said we would just sit downstairs. He took me to his room and kept trying to touch me. I felt pressured into kissing him but did no more. I kept asking can you take me home and he said no, get a taxi. So I did. Then, the next day he told all his friends that he “fucked me all night”. I was so upset, my brother and family found out but they think I went there willingly, because I am ashamed to tell them what actually happened. To this day, I’ll never trust to be around a drunk guy on my own or walk home on my own.",,
Boys bullied and slut-shamed me for having sex consensually at a young age and proceeded to use it as an excuse to spread my nudes around without my consent and place bets on who could finger me at parties when I was too drunk to consent.,,
"I was at the park with a few friends (boys and girls) we were messing around and he stole my friends phone so I tried to get it back but after 5 mins of running round after him telling him to actually give it back I decided to tackle him and I landed on top of his back. After that I found out he had been saying to people that we had pegged (""bum f*cked"") I felt so humiliated and lied to because that was not what happend and that could have spread around! I know it was a joke and maybe I should have not tackled him but I meant it in no sexual way it was purely me trying to get the phone back.",,
I remember feeling self conscious about my boobs as a 15 year old and being shy with my boyfriend about taking my bra off. He thought it was outrageous that I didn’t want to take off my bra because “he was my boyfriend and so he deserved to see them” sad thing is I complied to his wishes.,,
"Not of the same level as many stories here but when I was at university, I was out celebrating a friend's birthday. I turned up at the pub at the person celebrating saw me. He leaped on me, pushed me into a bush, his hands were all over me. He told me graphically what he wanted to do. I was with my boyfriend at the time so clearly wasn't interested in this guy who jumped on me. No one did anything. All the other friends laughed it off and said how much of a ""lad"" this guy was. My boyfriend was livid. I told him not to say or do anything so we didn't look like spoilsports. Everytime I saw the guy after that - he was the friend of a friend - he continued to touch me and ""flirt"" with me. I found it oo difficult to say something so I wrote to him and told him how it made me feel. He replied saying he knew I liked him and I enjoyed it really. He seemed genuinely surprised that I had an issue with him grabbing me in intimate places even though he knew I was in a relationship with someone else.",,
age 13 being pressured into nudes,,
as a child i was victim of multiple cases of sexual abuse. when i reached high school there was a boy also in my school who raped me and sexually assaulted me on many occasions. i eventually opened up to the head teacher about what had happened only to be told i was lying. he was made into head boy later that year. i was forced to see him everyday in school and due to the initial response of the teacher i delayed ever telling anybody else until the emotional trauma led me to attempting suicide.,,
"I was 16. My godmother and godfather and their sons had come over for dinner and to spend the night. They’ve been family friends ever since I remember. They were also part of the Christian youth group I attended sometimes. Me, my brother, his little brother and him were in my house, having a good time together. He was 17. Everything was fine until we had a lot to drink. My brother and his brother left the room, and we were beside eachother sort of cuddled up. I used to get very cuddly with my friends when I was drunk but I have since learned from this. He started groping my boobs and asked if he could do so, even though he’d already started. Uncomfortable with the situation, I hesitated but drunkenly said yes. I didn’t like it. He started putting his hand down my pyjama bottoms and groping my bum. This was even more uncomfortable. Thankfully I saw my brother coming in so I told him to stop and also reminded him that he had a girlfriend so I thought that this would get him to stop being weird with me. Many drinks later, we decided to go to sleep in my living room. I was on the sofa, the three boys were on the floor on mattresses. We were all very drunk, so I decided to attempt to go to sleep. The others stayed up, but then went to go to sleep shortly after. But he didn’t. I felt a hand creep up my blanket and up my leg. It honestly didn’t feel real. “Maybe if I pretend to be asleep he’ll stop?” I thought to myself. It didn’t. I just kept hoping that it would stop at that. I was wrong. He took my trousers down and I stiffened my legs as an attempt for him to not get them off. It didn’t work. He penetrated me with his fingers and it hurt. A lot. I desperately sort of hoped ‘maybe if I just lie here I’ll maybe like it?’. Funnily enough I never did like it. I froze in the moment because I was so drunk and it didn’t feel real. He then began to perform oral sex on me and it was then I finally plucked up the courage to ask him what the fuck he was doing. He urged me to just go to sleep and ‘we’d talk about it in the morning’. I just stared at him in shock. He then told me to go into the kitchen and we’d talk about it there. He began to panic and say ‘he thought I wanted it’. then my brother entered the room and asked what was going on, and I explained. My assaulter broke into tears. So did I. I don’t know if he did that because he genuinely was sorry or if he was doing it as a pity act and so I would feel as though it was my fault and not his. I wanted to share my story as I have been struggling since this incident and still sometimes feel like it was my fault. I felt as though if I hadn’t of acted in certain ways, said certain things, If I hadn’t let him grope my boobs earlier that night it wouldn’t have happened. But I want to tell you, anyone who is reading this, not saying no doesn’t equal consent. Freezing doesn’t equal consent. The way you acted previously, what you were wearing etc does not equal consent. If you agreed to anything else prior such as a small cuddle or touching it DOES NOT mean you wanted or agreed to anything further than that. The only way you consent to a sexual act is by saying “yes, I am comfortable with this.” Or “Yes, you can do this.” I did not say any of these things with what happened when I was trying to sleep on the sofa, and I am still coming to terms with this situation and reminding myself that it was not my fault. I didn’t give consent.",,
"I am in first year at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Last term I was in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] which is known for being for rich, privelidged kids. I didn’t go to private school and was shocked by the disregard for basic manners from the boys I met. The entitlement some of them show towards girls is ridiculous, as if everyone owes them something. In my second week I came back with a boy to my room when I was drunk but immediately felt uncomfortable when it was just us two. I told him he should leave after we kissed but he kept pushing me into the bed and pulling my clothes. I said no again and told him to leave but he told me to be quiet and kept kissing me saying I would like it. The only thing I could think was that if I accepted it it would be over soon so I let him have sex with me even though I was obviously completely still. I hate this boy and he probably bragged about it to his mates after and they have no idea of the real situation.",,
I was at school and the janitor would call me pretty and beautiful when he passed me. This was no big deal because I sometimes get compliments and didn’t think it had meaning behind it with him. Then one day when I was in the hallway at school during one of my classes he was putting up chairs and then he whispered to me “ if I were in high school you would be my girlfriend” and I just laughed it off but it was really scary then he walked away . But a day later I seen him in the cafeteria and then he looked me up and down and licked his lips. This was only one incident that happened at that school with me.,,
When I was 13 in year 9 my ‘close friend’ tried to finger me knowing I wasn’t ready (and I hadn’t even had my first kiss but then.) I didn’t think much of it because I was young and didn’t know what happened. In year 11 when I was 15 He then forced me into sex many times and it kept happening because I was too afraid of him telling anyone and I was on the verge of crying whilst he had sex with me on multiple occasions and one night in particular I was in my house on the verge of unconscious drunk trying to sober me up and he raped me whilst I tried to push him off me,,
"I was sat in my car as I had just parked up and a man in a mother car parked directly behind me, I had a bad feeling so I locked myself in the car and waited for the man to leave his car which took about 5 minutes. I knew i had bags to carry and with a heavy feeling on me i rang my mam and put the phone under my chin and walked to my flat. As i got around the corner he was there waiting for me. I started asking my mam “you inside still or have you nipped out?” “ Aw your in? cool cool” and the man tried to make conversation and i just speeded up around the corner to the door of my flat.",,
"I was 14/15 and was raped by my abusive girlfriend. I was young and she was the same age as me but more experienced. I had told her many times I wanted to take the relationship slowly and didn’t want to rush into anything quickly. She agreed but her actions were contradictory. She would constantly grope me in public areas like parks, shopping centres and at home. I was not comfortable with it and told her we were going too fast but as a guy in a new relationship you feel like you don’t want to disappoint them. You feel guilty for not going along with it. She would ask me to touch her and move my hand down to her privates all the time and one day she forced herself on top of me. I told her again that I wasn’t ready, she told me she wanted to see if it fit. I was frozen and panicked and felt powerless. We weren’t protected and I was so uncomfortable. She proceeded to have sex with me while I sat trying not to cry, conflicted to if I should be grateful or ashamed. She got off and told me I wasn’t any fun and then made me pleasure her as penance. I still have problems in relationships now, it is hard for me to feel ok when I’m a sexual situation, my anxiety goes through the roof and I end up embarrassing myself. It is still hard to come to grips with the fact I was sexually abused and assaulted. My friends would tell me that I’m lucky to have such an eager girlfriend, but it never felt right. It still doesn’t. She would bite my fingers even when I would recoil in pain, bite marks would be left on them for days/weeks, drawing blood on occasion. No matter how much I would express my discomfort and pain. She would punch me and leave bruises simply because I was “strong” and could “take it”. She proceeded to cheat on me with two different people and months after.",,
"Over a 3 month period when I was in year 9, a year 10 would message me continuously every day and find me at school and try and get me to go to the toilets with him so he could do sexual things to me. And no matter how much I said no he wouldn’t give up. Eventually my sister who was in year 11 tried to get involved but they had moved schools after the half term. I didn’t even want to go to school I was so scared. Glad to finally say I have left that school and will be going to college in September.",,
"Over summer I had cut off everyone besides two friends from sixth form. One of which was female and the other male. I considered the male to be trustworthy and we were very close friends. I introduced him to a huge group of my friends outside of school (most of which are a year younger than us). We had just finished year 12 and most of them had just finished Y11. We hung out in a big group a lot over summer and one time my male friend from sixth form invited a bunch of us to his for a party. We all went and on that night is when he assaulted/harassed me and a friend of mine. The girl in question was the year below and being the oldest female in the group, I felt incredibly responsible for what happened, seeing as I was the one who introduced my friends to him in the first place. He groped her ass and forced her face into his to kiss her. I wasn't aware of this until a few days later. The same night, when I was leaving I had said bye to everyone already and went into the bedroom alone to collect my bag (that's where everyone had put their stuff). He followed me in and gave me a hug which I reciprocated but then things turned nasty. He was very drunk (on several shots of vodka) and wouldn't let go. I tried to tell him that I needed to leave but he wouldn't let go of me and I tried to push him away but he gripped onto me harder and grappled my top with one of his hands. I tried to push him away with no luck and instead he pulled me onto the bed on top of him. I tried so so hard to push myself off and just couldn't do it. He was gripping me like it was fucking life or death. His hands started feeling up my top and at this point I panicked and managed to get up off the bed but not without him still attached to me. He then tried to grab my face and kiss me but I turned it away so instead he kept kissing me on the cheek. This went on for a while before he finally let go and I ran out of the room. On a separate night, another one of my female friends was also preyed on by him. She was very drunk and high that night and didn't even know what was going on. We had laid her on the sofa and gotten her water and were keeping an eye on her when he swooped in and decided to look after her. (This was before the party at his). To make a long story short, while she was completely out of it, he began making out with her forcefully and because she was in a state, she couldn't push him away or stop it. This happened months ago but I feel so wholly responsible and angry at myself that I trusted him and introduced him to friends of mine who are younger.",,
"After I had graduated from university I went back to visit my boyfriend who was still there. I went on a night out without him as he was studying for exams and I had some friends still there. I was spiked, regained consciousness inside the corridor of an apartment block I didn’t know existed, without any shoes on. I don’t know how I got inside, or how I got there. I have no idea what happened, and because of that, the police dropped it immediately. My head has been screwed up entirely ever since.",,
"One night, a guy I was sleeping with took the condom off midway through without my consent and without telling me. I realised when we had finished, and felt really scared and betrayed. I had to miss my seminar the next day to go and get emergency contraception the next day but was too afraid to speak of it again. I still don’t know if he even remembers doing it.",,
"This has happened multiple times with the same guy. At parties when drunk etc he will try and grab you and tell you what he’s gonna do to you (making rapey comments). He’s also groped myself and a number of others, putting his hand up girls shirts touching their boobs or grabbing their ass. He never apologises and his friends excuse it and say it’s just what he’s like.",,
"I was raped and sexually harassed by multiple people, multiple times. We get told to be quiet about it because it was ‘just a bit of fun’. i ended up having to drop out of school for my own safety. i am entitled to an education where i feel safe and comfortable to learn. and i was denied that.",,
"I used to sit on my sister's living room sofa on my phone. Her husband would carry me upstairs to their bedroom. I would fight and say let me go, stop but I was too weak. My sister used to be in the kitchen unaware. She didn't even come upstairs when I shouted. He would put me on the bed and put one hand down my trousers and one up my dress. I wore black leggings and dresses below my knees, my arms were long sleeve or if the dress wasn't long sleeve, I would wear a cardigan to cover my arms this shows that clothing doesn't matter! He would squeeze my breast and just leave the other hand on my vagina. I would kick and try getting his arms off I would shout stop let me go stop. But he wouldn't. I was 12. I am 15 now. I knew this was wrong and I told him multiple times to stop I fought the best I could. He did this to me 3 times(3 different days). Months later I realised I was sexually assaulted. I knew it was wrong at the time and I fought it, I just didn't know it was sexual assault. Now when I remember it, I just break down in tears. I'm scared to be near the guy. All my family members think he's such a saint, he's so kind, so amazing so if I say anything, they won't believe me. I'm also scared to speak up and afraid I would get blamed for it. I told 2 of my friends that I have been sexually assaulted they felt sorry for me when I told them but eversince, they never ever asked how I am, they never checked in with my mental health. Now I know, I only can rely on myself and God.",,
I was raped in the school bathroom,,
last year i was raped.,,
"i slowly started to be friends with this boy as he was my best friends, friend and he was always with us I never really thought anything about how weird he was around me until one day he came up to me and was acting weirder than normal and he came up to me and started touching my a$$ and he just kept touching me even after i told him to stop I pushed him away and after that he went back to the other side of the road and kept shouting about how i was begging for him to finger me and everyone believed him over me cause he was ‘nice’ around everyone else and after a few weeks it wasnt talked about in till about a month later and everyone found out i was true and to this day I refuse to hang around with him and let my friends be around him in case he does anything more with them.",,
"he was my boyfriend at the time and we only were together for 1 month, i was asleep and i woke up and he was touching himself and i at the same time, i tried to stop him but he wouldn't. i begged him to stop but he continued. his dad came home and he finally ended it. i went home crying and almost committed suicide, i had bruises on my thighs and hips for almost a month. i get flashbacks now with my current boyfriend and he's so sweet and supportive of me.",,
After sexual harassment/assault had become more addressed in our year as a problem the teachers decided to try and ‘help’ the issue in different ways which lasted only two weeks one of the ways they ‘tried’ to help is by collecting all the girls in our year in one of the school rooms and asking us if we wanted to that we could write down reports of our harassment or assault or anything like that on a piece of paper anonymously or you could put your name girls in my year filled up to both sides of the sheet and then the sheet was handed in at the end of the room for the one of the teachers to read to see the issues after that I guess there was some hope of change however we never heard back of the teacher and that was over a year ago it makes me mad to think of how many girls have left the school now knowing that the teachers were unwilling to address the Issue and their harassment and assault was not listened to and how this affects how we see our own assault/harassment as the teachers who were supposed to look out for us failed us. There’s so much more I could say about the mishandling of sexual harassment/ assault at this school.,,
"I had this friend who I viewed as JUST A FRIEND. We were normally talking and then he started making strange comments about my body, which I just ignored (I would not have the confidence to tell someone to stop) anyways we were together with two other friends and he decided that it would be okay to touch me wherever he wanted a few times. I didn’t say anything apart from a look of disgust. It made me feel so disgusting and I still do to this day however I no longer speak to him.",,
I was in class and this boy was continuously throwing things so I would bend down to get them and then after when we were cleaning up the room him and his friends groped me one by one while I was just trying to clean the room and after that the friend of his groped me as I was going up the stairs I was only 13.,,
"I was in a club with 2 friends, it was small but super busy and I was quite a bit drunk. My friends had gone to get a drink and I carried on dancing. I felt this guy dancing on the back of me, I tried to move away but it was so cramped I couldn’t, next thing I know he’s stuck his fingers up my skirt and inside me . I just stood there and let it happen bc he was so forceful I didn’t have the energy as I was so tipsy to struggle out of his grip as he had one hand on my waist. When my friends came back they didn’t realise what was happening and thought it was funny so took a video bc he looked so old. I look so out of it in the video.",,
"I have been continuously threatened of being raped. Called a hoe,slut and more. Male teachers makes us bend over in extremely short skorts self harm not being cared about.Pupil support was no use. I wanted to die because of the sexiest staff and pupils.",,
he touched me when i told him not to,,
I was in my house. I had come back from school a few hours ago. My brother’s friend from school was staying over for dinner. My brothers were both downstairs playing computer games and he was alone with me in my brother’s room. As soon as he knew the door was shut he felt me up. He felt my butt and then my chest area and then picked me up. He then put me down on the bed. He spread my legs apart and he felt me. He massaged my stomach and then he touched my vagina area. He put two fingers inside of me and felt around. I asking him what was happening and he didn’t respond. He was just feeling me down there. This happened more than once. When my family moved house and I had my own room with a lock he pulled his trousers down as well. I don’t know what happened after he did that because I can’t remember. I was 7 the first time it happened. I was 8 the last time it happened. I feel sick even thinking about it. I’m glad I’ve told people now though,,
My male teacher said to me and my class that we should stop rolling our skirts. They said that if they can “look up our skirts and see our bottom from the staircase” then we would get a detention. Now whenever I’m on the stairs and I see a male teacher behind me I run.,,
"A female teacher once announced to our sixth form year “girls, the weather is getting hotter, so don’t wear skirts, we don’t want year 7 boys looking up the stairs when you’re walking up them” The problem is right there, blaming women for men’s disgusting behaviour, we need to teach boys/young men. To respect women like how they are respected and not devalue our worth because of our clothing!",,
"This was years ago. We were new girls in sixth form in a boarding house that used to be a boys’ boarding house: there was one boy who used to climb through the window in the middle of the night into girls beds in the dorms. He would do his homework before (finding out who was in the dorm and ask if he could come visit at night. It sounded funny and fine and he was a head boy) then climb right into the bed from the window. He was very forceful and would try to stick his tongue down my throat, to try to have sex with us: we were sleeping and this man was on top of us. With one or two other girls in the room. He tried it on with whoever he liked who was in this dorm (we changed every term). The boys house was across the quad. I woke up to find him on too of me. He was forceful. I said no but still he tried. He would come back. Move onto someone else. He was the captain of rugby, head of the next door boy’s house and a senior prefect at the school. He got away with it because he was a nice guy, most of the time: but I will never forget waking to have him trying to stick his tongue down my throat and trying to forcefully have sex with me with a crazy huge hard on. We all tried to ignore it, as new girls just joined the school it would look terrible to report. But also it just became known about that room. We told our tutor about it, she downplayed it. One can’t help but wonder if this behaviour would lead on to casual rape culture in later life. He was 17. We were 16/17.",,
"In year 7, I was sexually harassed by another student. I was alone with her in the woods when she pushed me against a tree and started touching me. I ran away before anything more happened, a week or so before she had told me she had feelings for me and I had rejected her. Because of her character, in the moment I felt really unsafe and didn't take it as a joke. I ran immediately to the head of my year, fully having a panic attack at this point. She told me 'I don't understand why you're crying so much. Its not like she touched your private parts or anything'. Bear in mind, this girl had been grabbing my hips and thighs and was not slowing down. She sent me back to lessons and I just ended up hiding and crying in a nearby field. This member of staff is now in charge of mental health at the school. This member of staff who knew I suffered with extreme anxiety and depression and did nothing to help me. My school is a private girls school who has recently employed a male headmaster. They care a lot about their reputation and are very fake. I can't include the name of it because it would be very easy to find the member of staff and me but I really needed to say something.",,
When I was 16 I was in a relationship that was incredibly abusive. He used to physically force me to have sex with him and I was not strong enough to stop him. It went on for 10 months before he ended things and I am so scared he will do it to someone else. I was sexually abused as a child and so my view on sex and relationships is very flawed now. I’m trying to reframe it.,,
"I was 12. At my first ever party. The host was a good friend of mine and he was very popular so there were so many people there. His football team were there and i had never met them. I was talking to one of my friends when one of the football guys came up behind me and wrapped one of his arms around my waist and the other around my breasts. I was wearing red baggy jeans and a normal top that said coca cola. Luckily my friend stepped in and the guy left, it was dark and i didn’t see who it was, i cant tell whether it’s better that way. But i was 12.",,
"In year 10 I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend at the time. He took me to his bedroom while his parents were out and told me not to make a sound or tell anyone about it. He held down my neck against the bed so that I found it difficult to breathe or to talk, and he made me feel guilty, as though it was my fault. For two years my brain blocked out the memory entirely, and now it’s coming back to me in flashbacks and nightmares. I’m scared because today he walks free and I pray that no one else has been, or will be, a victim of his actions.",,
"I am constantly slut-shamed by boys in my school, just for having a boyfriend at the age of 15. But actually, they say it to loads of girls for no reason. Like wearing makeup or laughing loudly. In the corridors, they call us names like slag and bitch and whore. No-one stops them. The boys who say it, their friends just laugh.",,
"last year I got into a relationship with a guy. he seemed perfect, kind and considerate, a feminist even. all my friends saw us as a perfect couple and for a long time so did I. gradually things go worse, we would have sex fairly often and most of the time I was fine with it. however when I didn't want to he'd pressure me into it or try to. when I was okay with it he'd frequently get violent and say degrading things, which I never consented to. I rationalised this to myself for months, convincing myself it was okay and normal and that he loved me. after months of this we went on a walk in a Forrest where he raped me, this was what it took me to realise what had been happening. I messaged him that night to tell him I wasn't okay with what had happened. the next morning he broke up with me and in the months since this I've been processing everything that happened to me. the scariest thing is how no one would've ever guessed, even I thought what was happening was normal.",,
sometimes in middle school there would be this boy who used to touch me inappropriately but i never really told anyone. i did tell him to stop but he proceeded to keep touching me and one day i just asked the teacher to move him and it kinda stopped from there.,,
"I don’t remember a time I’ve gone out in public alone and not been assaulted or harassed in one way or another be that cat-calling, wolf-whistling, stalking, following, honking horns, inappropriate touching etc. However, the time that affected me most was one of the first.,I went to boarding school as my parents lived abroad and was flying home on a 10 hour night flight to see them for Christmas as an ‘unaccompanied minor’ aged 14 (I’m now 20). On the flight I was sitting in the aisle seat with a spare seat between me and the person at the window. As the lights went down for bed a man (maybe 40ish) came and asked if he could sit in the spare seat as his child was using his seat to lie down and sleep. Having seen the man earlier in its kids when I’d gone to the toilet I naively said yes.,Throughout the night he was inappropriate doing things like sleeping with his head on my shoulder, asking me if I wanted to sleep on his shoulder, rubbing his hands on my upper inner thigh etc. I even woke up to him on a few occasions stroking my eyelid. I couldn’t sleep and I was terrified, I didn’t know what to do. When I got off the plane and saw my parents I just burst into tears, they took it very seriously and reported it to the airline who also took it very seriously.,For years I couldn’t have anyone touch my thighs and to this day I can’t let someone touch my shoulders as it feels like when someone is holding them they have full control; this is to the point where if someone harmlessly touches my shoulder from behind I will physically lash out upon instinct even if they’re a close friend. And I’m not a violent person. It is only when I’m very comfortable in a relationship that I will let someone touch my shoulders.,I’ve been so numbed over the years to constant harassment and assault that in dec 2019 when I was 18 a man (36, wife and children) attempted to rape me twice and it took all my strength and screaming out both times to get him off. This incident has not affected me whatsoever. I hate that I am growing up in a world where I am not affected by someone attempting to commit arguably the most heinous act they could towards me doesn’t affect me because it has become the norm. It’s disgusting. Reading your stories has made it even more clear to me how often things like this happen and how many people are affected by them. Together, as a community, I hope that we can defeat rape culture. I want to thank Everyone’s Invited for all the incredible work you’re doing x",,
"i had snuck out to meet one of my best friends this summer and we found ourselves at about 4am bored with nothing to do. we’d recently made friends with a man at the local skatepark we go to and because everyone at the skatepark are different ages it’s not unusual at all to be a 17 year old friends with a 28-30 year old. me, my friend and this man were sitting at a picnic bench and the man moved to sit next to me. i was quite tired at this stage so i leaned my head on his shoulder, not even thinking this could come across as me being interested in him as he was significantly older than me and i wouldn’t have thought he would be interested in someone my age either. he started feeling me up and i just sat there because i didn’t know what to do. my friend then suddenly got up and left to get water from the fountain and i was alone with the man. he started making out with me (he’s 33 and knew i was 16 at the time) and i sat there and didn’t reciprocate but didn’t push him away out of fear he would do something if i’d said no. my friend got back and we left but i saw him a few days later and had to have conversations with him like it was normal and my friend did nothing even though i’d told him it was a very uncomfortable situation. i still see him around the skatepark sometimes and the thought of having to talk to him scares me so much that i sometimes get panic attacks when we’re there.",,
My first sexual experience which wasn’t just kissing was at a party. I was pretty drunk and I was walking around and then stood next to a boy. VERY quickly he grabbed my hand and we went to the bathroom. Being a naive 14 year old I didn’t try and leave or anything as there was such an excitement of doing anything with a boy at that age. In the bathroom we started getting off. Which was fine. He then put his arms on my shoulders and I went onto my knees. I didn’t say anything. He undid his trousers and pulled his dick out. Put my mouth on his dick and made me give him head. I had never done this before. I was gagging a lot but jusy went a long with it. I knew nothing about consent at this age. After giving him head we got with again and he kept saying how badly he wanted to fuck me. I didn’t know his name and I was 14! I said no many times. We didn’t have sex. I left the bathroom and was excited about what had happened. It was only yesterday when my friend and I were talking about this when I went over the whole story again. He never asked for any permission and basically made me give him head.,,
"I was dancing with friends in a club at 19. Suddenly my arm is yanked backwards and behind me there are a group of young men. One of them has his penis out, and his friend is pulling hard at my arm to try and get me to hold it. They are all laughing. I pull away, too shocked to do anything and turn back to my friends who didn't see anything. I don't tell anyone because it felt like ""nothing really happened"". I don't know what made those men feel entitled to grab me like that, and ten years later I now recognise this incident as attempted sexual assualt.",,
"When I was in year 8 a boy in my year, someone I didn’t know, just came up to me and started to touching me. I asked him to stop over and over but he and his friends just found it funny. Even my friends around me didn’t help me. I managed to get away from him and I felt so gross and I was really upset. I told my head of year and while he was very supportive to my face, no action was taken against that boy like I was promised. Now years later I’ve found out that that boy has sexually harassed and sexually assaulted multiple girls at my school. I worry about what else he’ll do to other people.",,
"I was 13 and I went to a guys house with a couple of friends to have a sleep over, eventually it was 1am and I went to bed, I hadn’t drank anything except for a chocolate milk the guy had given me. I woke up the next morning naked, with no memory of the night before. I still don’t know what happened that night and i think of it everyday",,
"i went to my boyfriend at the times house during half term to watch a movie and i went with one of my best freinds. We were all sat on the sofa and then he started whispering this stuff in my ear but loud enough so my freind could hear and then he asked me if i wanted to go upstairs with him and I didn’t know what else to do so i said yes. We had talked previously about how i didn’t want to do anything and kissing was as far as i wanted to go, although he’d done everything before so he knew what he was doing. When we got upstairs and i only wanted to kiss he got annoyed and asked me if that was seriously all that i wanted to do and i said sorry. He then asked to finger me and i said no but he did it anyways and i didn’t know what else to do so i let him even though he knew i was uncomfortable. I was so embarrassed that I never admitted that i didn’t want it until 6 months later. (I broke up with him the next time i saw him)",,
I was raped while I was high at a party. I was passed out and a guy from my college had sex with me. I have to see him around college everyday laughing and joking with his friends. He used to call me a slut in front of all of his friends whenever he saw me and now I have to hide around college if I see him because he terrifies me.,,
"found out that ""blue balls"" isn't a real thing. yeah guys might feel sexually frustrated but they don't feel physical pain. completely shattered me. I can recount so many times where a guy's begged me to at least give them a BJ so they're not ""in pain"". manipulative behaviour.",,
"It’s not just in secondary skls and unis. The problem stems way before that. In year 4 I had to change school because this older boy in year 7 who was in my school bus was harassing me. On multiple occasions he had wanted to finger me. I did not know what it was but when he told me I immediately tried to shut it down and caused a commotion so he stopped. My friend also in yesr 4 had let him do it to her (idk if it was consentual). I hope she is ok we bever spoke about it. He tried to aplogise by offering me a HARIBO. A couple weeks later I told my mum - i was so young and clueless of the situation that I thought it was because he liked me because he thought I was pretty, how naive. When I realised I felt shame and embarrassment and one day I went into a shop with my dad and he was there. When I saw him I hid and cried and told my dad we had to leave. We told the scjool but they did very little because he had almost finished school (talked to him even though he was using his age and power to target and exploit vulnerable primary scjool girls). I felt so uncomfortable I had to change school. Disgusting.",,
"When I was 15, I added someone I knew from school on social media. We had mutual friends and we were involved in clubs in the same department. He was 18, and in the sixth form attached to my secondary school. We started speaking on social media; I didn't intend for anything to happen. I was 15, and I was just having a generic chat with someone from school. During this time, I was at the peak of my mental illness (undiagnosed back then, out of a personal fear of seeing a doctor and confidentiality being broken - so my family finding out). Because he was older, and seemed less likely to panic and tell other people than those my age - I opened up to him about my struggles with mental health. It felt like nobody my age understood anyway. Mental illness wasn't really talked about then, and i didn't know anyone personally who had similar experiences at that age. He was reassuring at first. This was a relief because I had never told anyone, and he was actually being ok to me about it. He didn't think I was a freak, like I'd thought he might. As I opened up to him, he manipulated me. He was telling me how beautiful I was, and how sexy I was. I had only just told him how suicidal I was feeling, so I wasn't thinking clearly. It was nice to hear validation then, but I was mid-panic attack and didn't really consider the extent of the issue. I told him I thought I had an eating disorder. I had severe body confidence issues and I'd been starving myself. He manipulated me into sending explicit photos of myself to him. I didn't want to. I told him how uncomfortable I was with my body, how much I hated it. It was clear I didn't want to send the photos. He kept persisting, and I was so overwhelmed, I did it anyway. I cried and cried. I was scared of him. He was very tall and I saw him a lot at school - what could I have done? I was very embarrassed. One day, we were in the same block (the same department we had extra-curricular activities in). He got me to meet him in a small room so we could be alone. He touched me inappropriately. I froze. I just wanted to talk to him about what happened. I wanted to tell him we couldn't be together or do anything. He had sent me lots of graphic messages, and nudes before. He told me what he wanted very clearly. I felt so stupid for even going into that room, but I didn't consent to him touching me. Even if I had, it wouldn't have mattered - because I was underage and he was an adult. He knew he could take advantage of my mental state and my severe anxiety. If I said anything, he had my secrets and my photos. I felt like I couldn't do anything or he would expose me. I now have several diagnosed mental illnesses and I wish my first ever intimate experience wasn't taken from me like that.",,
"someone groped me in the student union, no one did anything.",,
i was sexually assaulted by another student as he slapped my butt as i walk past in the corridor,,
"when i was in year 7, i met this boy. i thought he was my friend. he would abuse me and my friends consistently. he would grab my legs under the tables, he would touch my ass. he wrote stories about having sex with me. he would harass me for pictures of myself. he would send me porn without my consent. this went on for two years. i am not the only person he did this to.",,
"""1. I was really drunk at a party I was having. I went upstairs and someone who I had kissed earlier followed me up and raped me in my bed. It was so painful as I was on my period and had a tampon in. My mum kicked him out, and he proceeded to send me messages telling me about what my vagina was like. ,2. When I was at a independent day school in London, men would sit in parked cars outside the school watching all the girls walk out in their uniform. I had people follow me on buses. ,3. I was in a club and a old ish guy walked up to me and grabbed my boob and him and his friends started laughing and I was so shocked and cross. I told the bouncer and luckily the bouncer kicked him out.,4. I was walking home from my local pub in the countryside and a guy I had been talking to offered to walk me home. He raped me on the way home, I was blacked out. I tried to lull myself a week later. The next time I saw him he was laughing with his girlfriend and I hid behind a car crying and having a panic attack.,5. I was in a chemist with a friend on holiday, and we turned around and a guy was staring at us and masturbating.""",,
I got touched,,
"Inbetween the ages of about 8 and 10 I was repeatedly sexually abused by my male neighbour who was a few years older than me (13/14). At the time, I wasn’t aware of what was happening to me, and it took me till I was about 14 to acknowledge that I had been abused. I was manipulated into thinking what was happening to me was normal and ok. I still have nightmares almost 10 years later.",,
"I was placed next to a boy in my A level Re class and had months of him touching my thighs, grabbing my waist and commenting about my body online. Of course I didn’t report it due to fear of not wanting him to get into trouble. Once he had left my class to do a different course, I informed both my course teachers about how uncomfortable I was and what was going on in their class under the table right under their noses. They both were shocked but never reported or mentioned it to me again, neither followed up to check I was okay. I never heard a follow up and a group of my class mates knew what was going on and never helped while he was doing these things, but proceeded to look and laugh asking him if he had a girlfriend.",,
"When i was 13 i went to a disco and when i was standing there with my friends i felt slaps on my ass, i turned around and there was a group of boys behind me looking and laughing at me so I couldn’t even do anything and i didn't know who did it as they are a group of friends. I felt SO violated and I’ve always told myself id never let a guy sexually touch me without consequences, but I couldn't do anything if there was a whole gang of them acting like horny animals. I don't know them, don’t remember them and there was a group of them so i had no choice but to walk away feeling very violated with my night ruined. I was 13?",,
"My experiences of being bullied, harassed, and inappropriately touched at [school name censored by EI to preserve anonymity] have given me mental illnesses that have lasted years after having left the school. Another student, whom I had thought a friend, became incredibly touchy with me. If I would ask him to leave me alone, or not sit next to me during lessons, sometimes he would become verbally abusive and of course refuse to move. The teachers would not move him away from me either. He would touch my leg and groin without my consent. This was a frequent occurrence. I remember once going into the supply cupboard during a lesson to locate felt tip pens, and the same boy followed me in, shut the door, and tried to get me to make sex noises for him so everyone else outside would hear. I felt angry, and I felt frightened. I had to shove him out of the way to leave. Another boy would come up behind me and over girls, grab our waists, and shake us around or pretend to hump us. At the time I thought it was normal for a young girl like me to recieve this kind of treatment. I thought it was part of being a woman. Now having grown up, I feel angry and ashamed that I had been allowed to feel this way, and not taught otherwise.",,
I left work to visit a friend who was going through a bad time. The guy was my best friends cousin and he touched me whilst we were hanging out. He then moved my hand to touch him and started to undress me. I tried to move away and said I didn’t want to and he carried on. He said if I didn’t have sex with him that he would rape me. That what he was doing normally worked. It felt like something I couldn’t tell people about because he would say I was lying or that it would ruin his life but he destroyed mine. He acted as if it was for my own good and made degrading comments the entire time. What scum. That was the first time. The fact we even have to start a story with the first time I was raped. There shouldn’t be a first time,,
"A couple of weeks ago , I was doing P.E and we were doing laps outside and while I was doing these laps the boys were also outside doing long jump and while i was running past them a boy started Whistling at me and then another shouted at me saying “nice thong (my name )” but the thing was I was wearing a hoodie and leggings and nothing was showing so I was very confused and I was just angry at them but did nothing and stayed quiet I know it may sound funny and nothing bad compared to what has happened to others but ever since then I’ve started being really self conscious and I can’t stop thinking about it and how it makes me angry that I didn’t say anything about it to anyone",,
"on the school bus home , a boy i walked down past on the isle touched me up my skirt and put his hands down my thighs when i walked past , i couldn’t see his face he had a mask on and his hood up his hair covering his eyes , i never saw him again . but i remember it every day",,
During my first term at University I was raped. I met a guy and his friends and they invited me round for a flat party. The two of us were the last in and he said he just need to grab his alcohol from his room. He then raped me leaving me covered in bruises and bite marks as well as a cut and swollen lip. I had to wait for him to fall asleep before I could leave as I feared he would try and hurt me again.,,
"I was bullied for years at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], teachers were aware of it as things would happen infront of their eyes…a boy in the year above forced himself onto me at school while other people videoed this was all going on in school time. I managed to get away but I was sexually assaulted repeatedly by the same group of boys everyday. I also constantly had people force me to take nudes and threaten me with death if i didn’t co operate. I’m older now and have realised how this was not my fault at all. But it left me battling severe depression, anxiety, ptsd and suicide attempts.",,
"When i was around 7/8 a family member started hugging and then inappropriately kissing me down my body. i remember pushing him off but he pulled me tighter and carried on. i’ve never told this to anyone - i only realised it was sexual assault a few months ago. i told myself i was being overdramatic for so long, but i want everyone out there to know that your experience is valid. you’re NOT being overdramatic.",,
When I was in 8th grade I told a boy I did not want to go out with him. He decided to pull a video off an adult site and tell everyone it was me. He then started selling this “video of me” this resulted to boys whispering things in my ear and touching me in the halls and even classrooms. I told the school and police but even now as I am a junior in highschool this stuff still continues and the boy was seated next to me in a class last year. The boy left our school but proceeds to live his best life while he has left a traumatic memory for me to deal with for the rest of my life. I was 13 I never deserved that but yet the school did nothing about it but tell me it would die down.,,
"When I was between 6 and 11 someone I knew, a friend at the time, much older than me, wanted me to fingering her and let her fingering me, I said no repeatedly and she threatened to never be my friend again, and you know how kids are this is usually the ultimate threat, so I against my will let her. We were in a camping tent, she took my clothes off and asked me to pretend she was a masseuse, she got on top of me from behind and started biting my butt, licking it, squeezing it and then she turned me around and started fingering me, It hurt, and trouble, I was in shook, static, just wailing and twisting in bother while she was abusing me. She then said she was having problems with her v***** and I escaped of doing it. But she then wanted me to kiss her, with tongue, I said no way, but she threatened me again and forced me to do it. She then told me to go on top of her and when I put my tongue on her mouth I again I froze, it was disgusting, bad, awkward and uncomfortable. That my mom questioned me because of the smell of the tent, and why I wanted so badly to take a shower before going home, I was so ashamed I said nothing. Years later in my 14’s, I started to remember and bother me. Since I have an open relationship with my mom I told her everything, she said it was ok, but I needed to tell this to a therapist. This haunt me ever since. I feel dirty, disgusting, a slut, I feel violated, guilty, in pain, awkward, uncomfortable, ashamed, abused, used, angry, scared. I am straight and I fear that when I kiss, I feel the same disturbing things I felt then, that it’ll disturb me on my future relationships. I’m embarrassed and disturbed by this event. Can’t live with this burden on my shoulders.",,
I was a freshman and he was a senior he insisted on walking me to the locker room and I thought if I agreed he’d leave me alone half way through the hallway he stops and asks me “can I have a hug” me thinking he would leave and leave me alone I said “sure” and I hugged him and I tried to pull away and he was trying to touch me and I kept saying no and trying to push him but he was forcing himself on to me and he was forcing me to kiss him and I kept saying “no no stop” until I finally pushed away and no one said anything when they saw…,,
"As a 17 year old girl, 2 out of the 3 sexual experiences with boys my age that I have had have included the line “you can’t leave/ stop yet cause that’s being a tease.” when I have genuinely had to go or wanted to stop. The other classic line i got was “you can’t just sit there/ leave now and give me blueballs”. This did not occur to me as wrong and I actually thought this was normal until recently when I actually apologised to my current boyfriend during sex for wanting to stop, being suprised when he reacted horrified that I would even think to apologise. “Blueballs” does NOT cause pain and no girl should ever feel pressured to continue sex just because a boy tells you this.",,
"I’ve been sexually assaulted countless times whilst in school uniform. From men pressing their boners on me on trains to being casually groped in the streets. One day when coming back from school a man would not stop talking to me on the bus, at first I thought it was weird as it was a packed bus why was he talking to the school girl. I was blunt but he kept asking to use my phone and a bunch of personal questions. I was looking around to people who saw what was happening and did nothing, until a man a few seats away got up and started shouting at him because he has ‘seen him follow other school girls home’. It caused a massive commotion and both men were kicked off the bus. I felt so uncomfortable but greatful someone had spoken up. Still, from that day forward I wore trousers to school instead of a skirt in hopes the harassment would stop - it did not.",,
"I’ve never told anyone about this but it’s been sitting with me for the last few months. In year 11 I started dating a guy in year 12. My mental health was down the drain and he tried to manipulate me into sending nudes “every time you feel like hurting yourself send me a pic” - I had barely turned 16 when he first did this and we’d only been together for a week or two. He was way more sexually charged than I was and continually made me feel guilty when I hadn’t let him touch me for a while or we just hadn’t been intimate for whatever reason, even when we were in our 20s. Despite me definitely not being comfortable, he often initiated sexual touching/kissing in public places and dragged me into public bathrooms to undress me. Two months into our relationship, we were fooling around in a public bathroom and he suddenly entered me from behind without any warning. I didn’t tell him to stop because I was horrified this had happened, but I was trembling and just burst into tears. He never did this again on realising my reaction, but every time we attempted to have sex I had a panic attack and I’m scared that one incident has scarred me completely. We broke up after nearly 5 years; it took getting out of the relationship for me to realise how completely wrong parts of it were.",,
"I was 14 and was throwing up at a party, one of my friends was helping me and half way though puking, he started making me give him head, I was so drunk he was pushing my head down cause I physically couldn’t move. Eventually i somehow got him to stop. I remained friends with him for years until I realised how fucked up it was and stopped making excuses for his behaviour.",,
I was raped multiple times by another boy in my school. He thought bc I never said anything it was ok.,,
"On of unfortunately many stories...Sat in music class at about 13 some boys started running their hands up my legs I instantly said ""stop"" they stated I had to say ""red light"" so I repeated the instruction they kept going and said ""fire engines don't stop at red lights"" and proceeded to run their hands under my skirt.",,
"When I was 15 I caught the attention of a boy who everyone liked, he indirectly kept asking me out through his friend who was also my friend, in the end we were at a party and he came over and said he really liked me, he said come outside and we ended up kissing. He tried to put his hands up my dress and I pushed him away and said I wasn’t that kind of girl and wasn’t ready for things like that. We kept on messaging for a month we went out i didn’t have a great childhood and when my step dad seen me out with the boy he slapped me across the face in front of him, I was having a tough time at home, after this happened our contact was less, i then went to a party on New Year’s Eve I was now 16, he was there I was troubled and ended up really drunk, the boy decided to take me somewhere away from the house, others at the party were telling him I was to drunk but he was intimidating to people. I cannot remember anything about that night I was so drunk all I know is he took me somewhere and after a while brought me back to the party and left, I had no knickers on, he had taken my virginity without consent as I was unable to give it to this day I still don’t know we’re I was taken or what happened. When we got back to school after new year I still had to see him and he had told everyone I was called a slag, and slut. I felt so ashamed of myself only when you start to grow you realise that it should never have been me that was ashamed, what always hurt the most is when sober I had made it clear that I wasn’t ready to do that, he waited until I was so vulnerable.",,
"I was raped, twice. The first time I was 18; I travelled to visit a friend at his university. He hadn’t told me he was also inviting some other friends from school, none of whom were particularly nice people; from the moment I arrived, they were joking at my expense. During the evening, someone in the group spiked my drink; I could barely see, couldn’t focus and was very sick. My ‘friend’ took me back to his apartment; once there, he raped me before rejoining his friends to go clubbing. When they all returned in the early hours of the morning, I could still barely move; fortunately none of them touched me, but threw things at me. I didn’t tell anyone because I was so humiliated. I convinced myself that no one would believe me because I had chosen to visit him, that it couldn’t be rape if it was someone I knew, that others would think I was ‘crying rape’ for one reason or another (we had dated briefly and broken up amicably almost a year prior). I hate that he got away with it, that he thought/may still think that’s an appropriate way to treat another human being, and that his mum, sister and girlfriends since don’t know what sort of person (I’m reluctant to say man) he really is. The second time was during my final year of university; I’d been chatting to a friend of a friend, who became increasingly touchy-freely. Towards the end of the night, I tried to leave, and told him I wasn’t interested. He got on the same bus (I couldn’t stop him, it may legitimately have been his bus), but then got off at the same stop, followed me home; I tried to run away but he forced himself into my apartment. He raped me; I suffered a significant panic attack during it, the only one I have ever suffered in my life, and he kept going. Again, I didn’t tell anyone; I thought my flat mates would think I was promiscuous for ‘bringing’ someone home, that no one would believe me because we knew each other and had been talking through the evening…I hate that he, too, got away with it.",,
"I was 15 in my own home, clearly drunk, and on my period. I was than taken away by a boy who than made me take out my tampon. He then proceeded to do stuff to me. Despite passing out on him, my head was pushed onto his dick after I had clearly said no.",,
"My school gives the girls constant detentions and lectures about our skirts being “too short” and that it makes us look less intelligent, the male teachers especially love to tell us off about our skirts it’s ridiculous because how does a skirt affect how smart i am",,
I was 15 and followed home from school one evening after hockey practice. I was followed all along the main road until I got to a house where I pretended by waving to someone that I lived there. After loitering for a little while the man dressed all in black carried on walking and I ran as fast as I could the rest of the way home. I was terrified to walk home alone again but had to. I’d been raped a year earlier by a family member but told nobody. I considered telling a teacher during a conversation about my parents divorce again when I was 15 but he responded by putting his hand on my knee in a supposedly comforting manner which quickly changed when his hand began to creep up underneath my skirt. He only stopped when another teacher knocked on the class room door and I left as quickly as possible. Wasn’t school supposed to be a safe place?,,
I was only 9 years old.I had a bigger chest then most girls my age so I got quite a lot of attention.My teacher made boys and girls get changed together and the teacher would sit and stare.He always would smirk and in me in a creepy way.On day he came up and called me cute and slapped my ass and he laughed … I was scared I didn’t know to do.It’s been a few years now and the more I look back it scares me my little sisters go to that school I’ve only just told my story now.,,
"Who bares the weight of the crime?,I was made fun of and teased for being a slut. I had told some friends that I think I may have been raped and received almost no response. It wasn’t even that no one believed me, I just don’t think anyone really cared enough to give it thought. The invalidation had almost erased this memory from my consciousness.,Trauma amnesia brought this memory back to me 3 years later at 19 setting off a whole range of issues like depression, anxiety and addiction which I have thankfully overcome.,Then comes 2nd Year, 1st Term at Uni and on my first day back I got drunk with my housemate. We decided to go by some more drinks and on our way asked to borrow a lighter from a guy walking past. He took us to his house just next to him where he let us into a party. We took Mandy from his mum who confusingly was at the party too. My friend was no where near as drunk as me and I’d left her to go upstairs and get with this guy.,After questioning him the next day on what happened that night he was adamant we never had sex yet couldn’t explain how my clothes came off and why i’d found cum was inside of me. Although the conversation led me to an ambiguous portrayal of what happened I left knowing I had been raped for the 3rd time in my life - and I’m not even 20 years old. I can’t help but think WHY ME!,For those male perpetrators, those nights and events were nothing but small drunken mistakes, perhaps a great night and another shag or a “misunderstanding” of boundaries that can be resolved with a quick chat.,For me, it is the very thing holding me back from knowing and understanding myself, from accepting my feelings and emotions, from feeling any sexual freedom where I’m no longer afraid. I am limited my the constrains of my trauma most days, and have even overdosed searching for a solution.,Quite frankly, I have been left to serve the sentence for their crimes and it’s not fucking fair...",,
"I had a boyfriend at the time. After a party a group of us came back to my place. One of the guys, who I’d met that night, tried to kiss me. I said “no, I have a boyfriend and he’s your mate” and I told my friends that he’d tried it. He then pressured me to drink more and more, and I blacked out. I remember nothing until I woke up naked the next morning in my parents bed. I immediately started crying. I phoned my boyfriend and he ended up breaking up with me as I “had slept with his mate”. I tried to explain that I didn’t remember what happened but he didn’t care. I felt that there wasn’t any point going to the police, as he was drunk too and it was such a grey area.",,
"own clothes day at school, age 14. my whole body was completely covered yet i still had sexual remarks shouted at me by boys in my year, accompanied by unwanted groping.",,
"During lockdown I went into school with my friend “my dad is a key worker”. Another boy also came in to do school work. During one afternoon the 3 of us became very bored and started to play truth or dare. Myself and my friends kept it PG with simple questions like, what is your favourite subject. Within a few turns the boy started to ask sexualised questions and make highly sexual comments to me and my friend. She and I tried to tell him to stop but he wouldn’t and just carried on. It made me feel so uncomfortable as I was still in the closet as a bisexual man. I told the school the next day about his sexist and sexualised comments but they did nothing to the boy. Sexual harassment can happen to both men and women!!",,
"I was in year 9 and he was in year 10, we were getting witj and he put his hand on my thigh, I moved it off because I didn’t want to do that. He then forced his hand onto me and fingered me. I kept saying no and he would pretend like it’s some sort of role play when I just didn’t want to do that. No means no.",,
"I was on a holiday and I met an older guy at the bar who I got along well with and we had a lot of chemistry. We went back to the hostel and started having sex and I made sure he wore a condom. I enjoyed it at first but then it got pretty uncomfortable and he had turned me around and pushed me against the wall quite hard so I couldn’t see him. After a minute I realised the condom was on the floor and he’d taken it off secretly, I asked him what happened and he said ‘it feels better this way’ and just continued to aggressively have sex with me from behind, pushing my hard against the wall. I felt so silenced and in danger all of a sudden, he was so so much bigger and stronger than me. I wanted him to stop desperately (I wasn’t on any contraception and didn’t know how to get tested abroad) but was too scared to say anything so just waited super still until he was done and left quietly. I didn’t tell anyone the truth for so long, I pretended it had been fun and nice because I felt so ashamed and embarrassed. I spent weeks worrying I was pregnant or that he’d given me an STI. Two years later I’ve realised how messed up that was and that ‘stealthing’ is actually a form of rape, but it’s been so so normalised.",,
Boys had albums on their phones of nudes from girls at school. Most I presume had been shared without consent. Being shown these albums taught me that my body was worth nothing.,,
I was touched in class by another student in full view of the teacher. The teacher moved me and told me to start wearing trousers. The student wasn’t spoken to. I’m still scared to wear anything that isn’t extremely modest now.,,
"I was in French and a boy I had previously been flirtatious with had sat next to me. We were mostly talking, but he put his hand on my thigh, basically grabbing it. Then he took it off, put it back on, and eventually moved it further and further up, reaching my penis. His hands are a lot more buff than mine which are quite slender, so his grip felt more uncomfortable than usual. At the end of the lesson, he suggested that we go to the bathroom together so he could “suck me off” and I frantically rejected it.",,
"he’s my brother. it happened when i was 12, i am now almost 15 and no one in my personal life knows about it.",,
"i used to love quick add, it used to be a place to meet people. But now a lot of the time a boy will add you and straight away as if you send nudes. When i proceed to say no they either air me, or pressure me even more.""",,
I was at a sleepover and all the boys and girls were paired up in rooms. I was put with this guy than I knew wanted to get with me. I told him I had work the next morning and I wanted to sleep but he took the duvet away and said I won’t give it back until you kiss me. I kissed him so that I could sleep but then he got on top of me and was really forcefully kissing me. He tried to go further so I said I had my period to stop him.,,

"he convinced me to get into his car during off campus lunch, he told me if i didn’t he would tell my friends the personal information i had shared with him. i got in the car. we drove to dairy queen, it was fine, we got back to the school. “i’m really fucking horny right now” he said. “uh okay” i replied trying to get out of the car, he kept the doors locked and pushed me into the backseat. he stole my first kiss and my virginity from me in the backseat of his car. we were in the school parking lot. people saw. nothing happened.",,
"It happened 3 weeks ago, I went out with my male friend who I really liked and had feelings for he had been a really nice guy. We were having a lovely time and I was enjoying myself he kept asking about touching my chest when we kissed I said no so many times, but he still did it. It’s the first time anything like this has happened I ran away crying he told all of his friends and they all messaged me apologising - I wasn’t ready for anyone to know",,
"(This is only about threats of rape) During my early years of secondary school, I started dating a boy I met a school nearby. he was a typical london boy, but I liked him. eventually, i trusted him enough to meet some of my family members and my friends, as we had been in a relationship for a while and were quite serious (as serious as you can be when you’re that young). one day, we were out together and he had brought up the topic of intimacy. he said he wanted to go to the next level, but I wasn’t ready. I immediately said no and explained why, and we got into an argument. it got so heated that he ended up punching my across the jaw, leading my to fall backwards. as I got even angrier, he proceeded to threaten to sexually assault me right then and there (and I thought he would). i ended up running away and I still got threats from him for the months following that. I couldn’t tell anyone because I felt ashamed and no one took it seriously if I did tell them.",,
"Had sex with a guy who initiated anal sex with no warning, discussion or consent. I went to sleep after and woke up at 5am as he had penetrated me whilst I was asleep.

"i was walking home with friends, we were in year 8 at the time so 12-13, and in our school uniform. it was just starting to go dark but there was still plenty of light, and we were in a group on a wide street. we were just walking, and a car pulled up beside us driving slowly, and the men in the car were telling us how beautiful we looked and how we should go with them. we didn’t react and they got angry, threw their cans and bottles at us and drove off honking their horn.",,
"Parents, teachers, headteachers and MPs really need to stop sticking their heads in the sand when it comes to sexual violence experienced by girls. Throughout my time at secondary school, incidents of groping, trying to undo a girls bra strap through their shirt while they sat in class or assembly, upskirting (either lifting girls skirts up to look at their underwear or on one occasion to take photos), circulation of nude photos (which had been obtained from girls by boys in older year groups) and unwanted explicit messages occurred on school grounds and little action was taken - in fact us girls were blamed for the length of our skirts more than anything. Whispers of sexual assault happening at parties and catcalling from members of the public while we walked to and from school also happened and nothing was ever done - no assembly, no talk, no action. It was this unspoken almost everyday occurrence and none of us knew how wrong it was until we were older and out of that environment. Unwanted sexual advancement and actions against girls in school is so common it’s almost deemed as normal. If someone does stand up for themselves they’re vilified, labelled as too sensitive and often ostracised; they are failed by the inaction of incompetent and unsympathetic teaching staff turning a blind eye or labelling by it as “boys will be boys”. Until appropriate action and consequences are taken and made, nothing is going to change. It makes me so angry looking back on that time because we would even hear of it happening in other nearby secondary schools - that behaviour was just so normalised and us girls just had to get in with it.",,
"The sexist culture at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was insane. The day to day sexualisation of women was appalling. Boys would frequently grope girls and put their hands up our school skirts when we were walking to class. They would call 12/13/14 year old girls frigid if they hadn’t done anything sexual with boys but also call 12/13/14 year old girls sluts, whores and easy if they had done anything sexual with boys. They would share private photographs with their friends and frequently openly talk about which girls’ pictures they had saved in their ‘wank banks’. Many of these photos they had simply saved off social media. They took innocent photos and sexualised them.",,
My older brother was touching me and occasionally would commit aggravated asodimy on me. When the school found out they were actually very nice and supportive towards me. The SA happened from when I was 5-12 years old.,,
"my teacher is constantly touching my leg and making rude comments on my skirt length, such as “if that skirt comes up any higher there may be a problem down below” he constantly tucks my hair behind my ear when I’m working and whispers in my ear, he rubs my shoulders in a massage movement when he’s “helping” me with my work and when i tell him to get off he just looks at me as if he’s offended i told him no, there’s been one time I’ve properly kicked off about it and caused riots all around the school and told the other members of staff everything and he dident even say anything he just shrugged his shoulders and the teachers beileved him and blamed it on the length of my skirt. so when i started wearing trousers him and the boys would joke about me being the class slut about how tight my trousers were to my legs and “ass” the teacher once grabbed my bum and all the boys started laughing as if they idolised his behaviour and then did it all the time whenever he was in they’re presence and they would all laugh about it as if it was funny. that was until i went to a party and a boy there who was in my class wanted to have sex with me i moved from position 3 times and he still pinned me down and did it anyway, i cried the whole way through and asked him to stop. then the following Monday everyone knew I had “slept” with this one boy, and when we had that specific teachers class the boys made sure he knew about it “sir, guess who slept with _____” on the weekend and pointed i my direction, the whole class started shouting “you shlag” until I said I dident want it though, the teacher called the boy that SA me to the front of the class and they were whispering and me actually expecting this teacher to say somthing, instead shortly after that same boy returned to his seat smirking while the teacher laughed.",,
"when i was in year 7 (i’m in year 9 now) there was this boy in my class that liked me and he was pretty chill about it and i didn’t feel uncomfortable around him. but his friends would come up to me as i was walking around the school and tell me he wanted to rape me and get inside of me. they also gave me notes in class asking me to meet him behind the school so he could rape me. i was 11. i confronted the boy about it and asked if it was true, and he said that he never said any of those things and that his friends made it up, so i asked the friends and they admitted that they made it up. i am also autistic so this was very hard and upsetting to handle, as well as the fact that i was sexually abused as a child. i told the school about it and they just said that they were ‘just being boys’ and to ‘take no notice of it’. i later found out that they had harrassed other girls in my school.",,
"i had been speaking to them for a few weeks and they kept pressuring me to be in a relationship a week later we went out together and sa me, we go to the same school together and although are in different years sometimes still see each other.",,
"On our first ever date, my ex started coercing me into doing things to him in public when I’d already told him no. It got to the stage where I stopped saying no because I was scared and embarrassed. He raped me in a field - this was my first ever sexual experience. He then took me down to a muddy river bank and did it there too, then he raped me on a public footpath in thorn bushes so my hands and knees were cut badly. He then fingered me on the side of a road where people watched it happen and said nothing. He made me bleed and it was awful. People watched me get assaulted and did nothing to help which meant it took a long time for me to realise that he actually did anything wrong - I still question whether he did anything wrong to this day. This happened a year ago but it still hurts like it happened yesterday.",,
I was groomed and sexually assaulted by a 6th former in our school. I was in year 8,,
around this time last year i was coerced into sending some of explicit pictures of myself to a boy i thought i knew quite well. i already felt ashamed at myself and merely a few hours later a group of around 6 boys all spam messaged me hateful abuse along with the same images i sent. They’d been sent to a private story and i felt disgusted that people had seen such a vulnerable part of me with no consent and no way of stopping the spread. i was only 15.,,
Drunk after a night out literally was dropped off by my male friend to his friends house who I said I fancied and we had sex but I literally have no recollection of it / did not consent,,
"Whenever I wore tight-fitting clothes to school I was constantly told ‘nice bum’, ‘oooh look at you today’ and ‘damn [my name]’ in leering and sexual tones by a certain group of boys in my year, none of whom I had any other contact with. This school has horrific catcalling problems.",,
"I was sexually assaulted, the boy was at a different school yet most people who were at my school either wanted to defend him or deny it even happened. It made the whole trauma 10x worse for me cos not only was I trying to get over the trauma I also had to deal with all these boys victim blaming even while knowing I was completely sober wearing a tracksuit not that should even have to matter yet I was constantly questioned about it which just goes to show how a lot of boys are so ignorant to how serious this matter is",,
"In this secondary school (before i moved into college after lockdown) any sexual assault or harassment was covered up or not dealt with since it was ""outside of school affairs"" when it would happen in school quite frequently.The sexual assault was non-discriminatory to what social group you were in. There was one person in particular that would always harass my friends by grabbing their behind and saying disgusting comments whilst the teachers would shrug it off or even scolded the victim as this person was in the Special educational needs so they protected him from any calling out to his behaviour. This person also had the police called as there was rumours that he had coerced his little brother (the brother joined this school a year after this was brought up) into sex to which he allegedly admitted was true but then started to deny it. Other experiences i witnessed were nudes being exposed around school without the girls notice (until too late) leaving the girls helpless with no dignity as they were slut-shamed. Personally, i was one of the luckiest only getting the odd call-out as i wasnt exactly the most appealing person in my year. I am unsure if there were any girls sexually assaulting/harassing boys as i was never told however it would of been likely. This school was a living hell for me and made me feel extremely unsafe, i hope writing this testimony will raise awareness of how disgusting it was and how little the teachers cared.Nobody i knew went to the teachers in these scenarios because of the fact we knew they'd offer no sympathy and help especially to those whom were unpopular during their time at this school.",,
"know many girls from my school can relate in the fact that many of the boys are respectful however as you become closer to them and hear their actual conversations the normality of discussion of girls bodies and inappropriate situations is evident. I have experienced many inappropriate encounters from multiple boys and have had comments made constantly. I have confided in a trusted adults before but have been told continuously that the boys were ‘just young’ or they ‘didn’t know any different’. How can you say that when they are literally stroking and grabbing me after i continuously tell them to stop. Teachers have watched me become distressed by boys touching me and frustration rising in me after i continuously tell these boys to stop. Not once have they ever called them out. It is disgusting. These boys are soon men who will continue these ways as no one highly respected has targeted them. To put it short, in year 7 a boy tried shoving something (an external object) up me from behind when i was unaware. His friends all laughed. He has probably forgotten this now but i think about it often. I don’t want people to sympathise for me or say i’m attention seeking but i strongly believe England especially does not talk about this topic enough.",,
"Last year I was in an Uber alone coming back from a club in my first year of uni. The driver thought I had passed out/more unaware than I was. He took my phone and bag, put them in the boot and when he pulled over for me to get some air. When I was leaning out the side of the car he pulled my trousers down and tried to rape me. Luckily I reacted and he stopped. I told the police who did not do enough as they took my clothes but didn’t actually test for his DNA. the case was stagnant and i was encouraged by the police to end the case.",,
One day I was sleeping over at a friends house with a bunch of friends. I ended up sleeping next to a boy that I wasn’t really friends with I just knew of him from school. I woke up in the middle of the night and he had his hand down my pants,,
When I was 14 I went to a party at my friends house. My drinks was spiked so I was basically unconscious. I remember waking up at one point and this 17 year old boy was fingering me. When I went back to school on Monday I was confronted by all the boys - who I had regarded as friends - calling my slut and shouting the perpetrator’s name down the corridor. This meant that it wasn’t until I was about 19 that I realised I’d been sexually assaulted because I had always been blamed and shamed for what he did.,,
"There was a pedo at our school and boys slap the girls bums. Inappropriate comments about girls e.g skirt length, no rights.",,
I have been sexually harassed in this school my whole life.,,
"When I was 12, I was sexually abused by family members and a friend in school.",,
"she was a good friend of mine, we were friends from the age of 13 and when we turned 15 that’s when things because abusive. i was coerced into a relationship with her and i was coerced to perform sexual acts due to fear of what harm she could to herself, i was scared about the thing that would happen if i didn’t listen to her needs. even after i told her i couldn’t, she made me feel guilty and made up numerous lies which scared me and so i continued performing them. things got worse and led to strangulation and sexual acts being performed on me. i still remember saying no. i still remember pushing her away. i still remember the blood after. she never listened to me. i’m thankful that me and her are not friends anymore. girls also sexual assault girls.",,
"While on holiday with my family ( I was 21) and my best friends came too. We went to a beer festival in France. A young local man put his hand up my skirt and into my pants. His girlfriend then slapped me ?! My friends , one male and one female, threw a drink over him. Several men then appeared and beat them both up. It still remains one of the most terrifying things that has happened to me. We were just having fun and it was literally out of nowhere.",,
I was 12 sad atm and had no one i thought he loved me i thought tht cause i had jo one but he was just using my for nudes I regret it sm and im hurt because i thought ue loved me,,
"When I was 14 or 15 a boy in my year dragged me down a corridor calling me sexist and abusive names, in front of his friends. I smacked him across the face...... Then was threatened with suspension by the deputy head teacher.",,
He came into my room i was staying at (he’s my cousins *now* husband and i was staying the night at her house) and he laid in my bed and tried to touch me again (he’s done it in the past) i was drunk and was unable to do anything and all i could say was “you’re engaged” and he leaned in and whispered “just because im engaged doesn’t mean im married” as he put his hand down my pants. when he was done i just laid there in the dark and cried so hard.quietly. so no one would here me.,,
"I remember going to parties with my friends having a good time dancing to the music , and some of the boys would come along and pour more vodka in our drinks, telling us that we’re boring if we didn’t finish it. These were the boys we were all friends with would go to dinner or the cinema with . I remember being taken in a bedroom of the house and he locked the door and i couldn’t stop him touching me it’s a blur because i was drunk and i regret ever going that day. But it wasn’t just that day but every party. Pushing the girls into rooms and taking advantage of us touching us when we screaming and begged them to stop . If we ever said anything the next day they’d call us liars and stick together to shut us down even when we had the bruises and hand prints on our bodies to prove it .They’d make jokes at school about who pullled the most who pulled the ugliest and who got the furthest .The next few parties i stayed sober lying i was on antibiotics , i wasn’t really but i wanted to protect the other girls. I remember running into a room and dragging a girl basically unconscious out of a room while the guy stood there shouting at me to let go of her . This happened multiple times . Their excuse was they were rich and deserved it. They’d also tell us the girls deserved it too for what they wore. We stopped going to the parties but they just invited other girls. After a while it never got spoken about again we had to accept it and move on.",,
"This boy had been one of my close friends for years. He constantly objectified us all but we ignored it as it was ‘just jokes’. He would find it appropriate to comment on my body and my female friends’ bodies too, making comments about how we look. Once he upset me so much i deleted Snapchat and stayed away from him for months - and yet i always ended up becoming friends with him again because he had a very charming personality. But it continued and only got worse. I’ve only ever been platonically friends with him, nothing more, no attraction. When he was drunk, he would hug you so tightly, you couldn’t get away. He would kiss all down your neck even as just friends and would get so upset at the words ‘no’ and ‘stop’. Once at a party, when he had a girlfriend, he locked me in a bathroom and forced himself on me, getting really upset when i wouldn’t kiss him back. I managed to escape and ran out the room crying. Again, he was bored, there was no attraction. Later that same evening he hugged me and was kissing my neck and wouldn’t let go. He pretended none of this happened the next day. I got so uncomfortable around him that I could no longer even hug him because I was scared he was gonna touch me up again (which he got upset about). He contained commenting on girls’ bodies when sober and touching up, shoving his hands down his friends’ tops and up their skirts, all while drunk. Everyone just ignored it. Not to mention he’s super sexist, racist, misogynistic and xenophobic. I hate how for so long it was passed off as flirty banter. Safe to say we are no longer friendly",,
"It was my first time having sex with a guy in the year above, (i was 15). I remember he said close your eyes and i did what he said because i was scared, but he took pictures of me and him in sex positions and when i heard the camera go off i said i’m not comfortable with it and i said delete them. he said they are for his eyes only for future, but i had no trust in that and i was so scared what would happen to them but i just accepted i wouldnt win. when we had sex it was so painful and i said please stop and he kept going and said shut up and i remember just feeling so worthless and vulnerable. after i said i had to use the bathroom, but in reality i just broke down and cried in there for 20 mins. the worst part is he goes to my school and his face haunts me still to this day.",,
I dated this girl who went to middle school with me for a few months. after a while she began to abuse me verbally. then physically. then sexually. first she touched me while I was asleep then it became so much more. I didn't want it.,,
"Was flirting with this guy, invited him back to my place. We were both drunk. We started kissing and he started fingering me and I must have passed out because I don’t remember what happened next but I woke up with him on top of me having sex. I didn’t say stop so I felt it couldn’t be classed as rape. The next day I remember waking up with bruises all down my legs and around my vagina. He might as well been punching my vagina it was so bruised. I never told anyone because I didn’t know wether I had been assaulted or whether it was my own fault for being drunk and inviting him back.",,
"I was raped by a stranger. It started as consensual, he told me to turn around and he pinned me down. I kept telling him no and stop but he didnt, when he finished i ran home. My mind was blank for hours.",,
"When I was at university I went back with a boy to his house. We started having sex. I had recently had an operation and it began to be painful. I asked him to stop, a lot of times. He said if I told him to stop again he would hit me. I panicked and struggled and shouted “stop” and “get off”. He then flipped me over, and hit me in the lip (I am not sure if this was intentional). He was behind me, pushing my face into the bed, I was crying. After a minute or so he finished. I got dressed as quickly as I could. My lip was bleeding. He sat on the side of the bed and said “I’d never hit a woman” quite a few times. I didn’t know what to say. I ran to a friends house nearby. I thought it was my fault for going back to a boys house that I just met, even tho I’m a feminist. I also felt guilty, and I felt like if I reported it, it would ruin his life. I just wanted to forget about it. Now I worry he has done it to someone else and I am partially responsible for not reporting it.",,
After being asked and asked for explicit pictures it ended up making me feel like all I was worth is just a little picture for someone else’s liking but when I started to say no people started getting violent saying thing that they would do “kill your family “ one person even took a photo of my location and told me they were going to come to my houses and rape me then show people a video of it even my family it’s usually straight acting boys who are scared of there sexuality getting violent and In the end this made me go to a place where I planned my suicide everything laid out until someone noticed and helped me- Sam,,
I was in a group with him for GCSE drama and during one of the lessons he came up behind me and groped my breasts.,,
"I'm probably rather older than most of the girls / women who have posted testimony here, but still, the website is called *Everyone's* Invited. I changed schools in Y9, in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I had been at an all girls' school, where (looking back) some of my peers were interested in boys, but boys still weren't talked about much. At the new school, a mixed one, I remember boys being the subject of girls' conversation most of the time, and probably vice versa. Girls and boys regarded an attraction as a relationship if dating had lasted 3 weeks. A couple who had been dating for a year were seen almost as freaks. I wasn't interested in boys yet, certainly not sexually. And I was bullied, and treated as a freak, for that, by both girls and boys, for three years, until I left at the end of Y11. I remember some of the girls deciding to tell me how sex works. I think it was on the bus home. Their comments included the phrase ""pull down your pants and jump into bed"". The bullying meant that I was reluctant to even talk to boys, especially boys that I liked, for fear or being made fun of. After all, if I was bullied for my views when I wasn't even interested in a boy, what on earth could happen if I was interested? I seemed to be the only child who wasn't interested in a relationship - there simply wasn't space in the pupil community for children like me. And that feeling has persisted far into my adult life. It's only since #MeToo took off, and in some ways only in the last few months, that I've begun to realise that it was ok that I wasn't interested in boys sexually, that there were probably many girls at that school who felt the same and who couldn't speak out because of the prevailing culture.,The school did nothing. I can't believe that the staff didn't know about the bullying or the reasons behind it - the culture was so clear that they must have known something. Discipline in classes was bad, so even if staff didn't hear what was said at lunch and break times, they must have heard what was said in class.",,
"Basically, the teachers knew. They knew how the boys treated us, like we were worthless. Insanely misogynistic school, I don’t know one girl from there who doesn’t have a terrible story about the way a boy or group of boys has treated her. After I left I had to regain my sense of self, because it had been ripped away from me. They would touch us, slap our asses, shout down the hall that we smelt “fishy”, etc. Soo much sexual assault. And the school condoned it. This isn’t just a [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] problem.",,
"I’m still 13, a guy kept replying to my story on Snapchat saying wow and fuck me. I was unnerved so said thanks. He said no seriously I want you to fuck me. I 13 said how old are you? He said 16 I said well I’m 13. He said it was fine and tried to pressure me into sending nudes, I don’t know his school all I know is a 16 year old tried to force 13 year old me to send nudes",,
"I was under the age of consent and he was two years over it. I was at a party and it was one of my first times drinking heavily and when he started to kiss me I was so excited - until he pushed my head down to his penis and held it there and it felt like it couldn’t breathe. Until he took me to his car where I blacked out to the memory of him forcing himself inside me. I woke up unconscious in a corridor of the party having lost my shoes, my pants and my bra, having a hazy recollection of what had happened. When I went into school the next day I was labelled a slut for having had sex so young and so publicly, while a photo of my lost bra and shoes circulated around school. Surely people would have realised that if I was so drunk to have lost my shoes and underwear, I couldn’t have had the capacity to give consent? The lack of awareness of consent at the time (and failure to provide sex ed at my school) meant that I didn’t realise I had been raped until years later - I thought the fact I hadn’t screamed, I hadn’t run away, that I was so drunk that I let myself get in that situation, that the lines were blurred, meant it was my fault. I hadn’t realised why I’d cried every time I saw myself naked for six months after, why this fear of my body eventually manifested itself through an eating disorder which I presume was an attempt to get control back over it when I felt like it wasn’t mine anymore. I didn’t understand why I was so afraid of having sex for years afterwards, and to this day, hardly a day goes by where I don’t think about what happened to me. If you recognise this story, please don’t contact me about it - I just wanted people to see it from my point of view, and maybe feel confident to share stories about their own experiences of [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], where I felt that rape culture was really normalised.",,
"I have only recently realised what happened to me in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was sexual assault. I have carried guilt for 5 years, I’ve labelled myself as a bad person because I blamed myself for “cheating”. The reality? I said no, possibly over 50 times in the space of five minutes (although I couldn’t tell you how many hours this went on for). I said no I don’t want this to happen. No. No. No. No. No. Over and over. I couldn’t have been any more explicit. No. When I realised he wasn’t listening I felt a sort of disassociation. I felt like I was watching myself from above and I could see what was happening but I couldn’t stop it. I can vividly remember lying and just resigning myself to my fate. This was happening. He started by kissing my neck, cheek, ears then lips. I said no. He then went on to rolling me over to him and making me touch him, forcefully moving my hands to his crotch when I was trying to move it away. He laughed and said “you’ve kissed me back”, and I was stunned. I didn’t know how to say no more clearly. I now wish I’d ran out of that room, from that gross bed on the floor, ran out of that house, ran the five miles home. I wish I’d pushed him forcefully, I wish I’d sworn I’d never see him again, I wish I’d known it was sexual assault. But this boy gaslit me in to thinking because I’d “done a bad thing” I should break up with my boyfriend because he’d never love me again and I was young and clueless, I was just 17 and I was very mentally ill and easily manipulated, I had no self worth and it was diminished more significantly from this moment on. I then ended up with this abuser for 2 and a half years with no acknowledgment or understanding that this was what it was. Sexual assault. I now want to scream it from the rooftops but I’ve already tried to publicly acknowledge it and immediately got backlash. I feel he will never understand that what he did to me that night has stayed with me in such a considerable way: in-fact I think he’ll remember that night fondly. I think he’ll be clueless that it’s made me so miserable and brought me to thoughts of suicide. I want to confront him so badly. So I hope he sees this and recognises YES this is about YOU and you should be aware you’ve ruined the last 5 years of my life. YOU owe ME a voice to say NO.",,
"""I was 8, walking home from school. Nice neighbourhood, 2 minute walk. Broad day light at 4pm. It was my usual route as it was towards my mums workplace.

"I was sexually assaulted by my girlfriend of several months. I wasn't cautious at all beforehand, as I always thought of sexual violence as something that happens in heterosexual relationships. Since then, I struggle to communicate with partners, and don't enjoy sex as much. I believe that if our (all girls) school had done better in educating us about consent, this could have been avoided.",,
When I was about 15 a boy I had known since I was 10 years old fed me vodka at a party & followed me around literally all night despite me telling him to leave me alone & that I didn’t want to get with him.. when I passed out on the floor he eventually got his way & rolled on top of me and started kissing me. I didn’t even think it was bad and laughed it off for years until a male friend brought it up & called it what it is: sexual assault. It makes me really angry thinking back because I was just so powerless.,,
I’m sixth grade I was locked in the bathroom with my best friend at the time. She started touching me and tried to convince me to stay with her and skip school. My ex boyfriend from middle school also constantly asked me to send nudes and would be emotionally manipulative,,
"I had to learn via a TV show that removal of a condom during intercourse, without the knowledge of your partner, legally constitutes as r*pe in the U.K. And that is how I learned what had happened to me was more than just an experience that 'felt' wrong, but was also wrong in the eyes of the law. It meant I never reported it or felt I could as it was not something I was ever taught at school.",,

"I was very drunk at a party and he was sober. By all means I did want to get w him, but ONLY kiss. I made this very clear. He pulled me into a room with him which I didn’t think anything of, jus that he wanted some privacy and somewhere without an audience. He proceeded to block the door with his entire body weight and kept ripping my clothes off me, after me continuously putting them back on. I tried to leave and he pulled me to the floor by my hair. After already having multiple bad experiences of sa before, I genuinely feared the worst at this point. Luckily after a while I was able to persuade him to move away from the door and run out to other people. I can’t imagine what else could hav happened had I not been able to get him to move for a second.",,
"I was involved with a university staff member my first year of university. I asked him to put a condom on the first time we had sex and at first he ignored me. I asked again and he told me to calm down and that i was being stupid for thinking he wouldn’t put on a condom. Next thing i knew he was apologising and trying to convince me “it slipped”. When i went to the university to ask about reporting what happened they confirmed it was a clear case of stealthing and that a teacher raping a student was very serious but that it would be a “very complicated procedure” as i would have to involve the police. Instead, the university recommended i “get away” for a while on my semester abroad and go to therapy. This staff member went on to date other 18 year old girls- one of whom reported him as well.",,
I was on face time to a guy I trusted and he started asking to see my body and I repeatedly said no I then fell asleep on FaceTime and he started wanking over me being asleep I woke up and saw this and immediately left the call and blocked him on everything.

"Nowhere near as severe as any of the stories but i’ve noticed with these boys that they feel very entitled. one of them begged me for nudes for hours and hours and i didn’t give in, however it’s a pattern with them to think it’s ok to also FETISHISE girls too. one asked me can you twerk (i’m black). not assault but it’s very annoying to have to deal with this. they also talk ab women’s bodies in such a disgusting manner than i got off the bus early.",,
"It was the summer after GCSEs and I was meeting loads of new people at different parties and events. Throughout the summer there were multiple incidences but the main one took me over a year to come forward about. I had been drinking a lot that night and we were on a field and one of the boys there asked to go on a walk, I had met him acouple times before so didn’t think much of it. We walked away from the main group and I couldn’t walk properly and needed to sit down. All I can remember from that moment onwards was feeling something in my mouth and they waking up later to find my underwear round my ankles, my top pulled up and him sitting there on his phone. I didn’t want to say anything as I couldn’t remember what happened and persuaded myself that I was probably drunk and said yes but just don’t remember. I kept this hidden for months and kept telling myself it was my fault. I finally came out about it I told someone who I thought was my friend only for a couple weeks later her to go around spreading it and telling people I was lying. I came forward to the school about it not long after and when the police got involved I was told there was nothing they could do as the incident was too long ago. To this day I still feel uncomfortable telling people about this as I’m scared they are going to say I’m lying or it was my fault.",,
"He was a friend i met in school. We shared food, stories and memories. But it was only me and him in that room. no witnesses except he cctv at school that would show us walking home like we always did, nothing out of the ordinary. I walk a different way to school now. I dont want to go out with some of my mstes because they dont know so would invite him along. I feel so guilty as only a few weeks after, he celebrated his 1 year anniversary with his long term girlfriend. They are still together. Only a few people know as i couldnt hide the panic attacks or the way i froze the moment any pressure is applied to my neck for much longer.",,
"This isn't much but, he harassed me on social media. Begging for pictures, for sex. I always said no and ignored him because he was my friend when we were younger. But he started being mure brave about it,braking jokes about it. Placing his hand on my thigh during lessons, I didn't dare say anything. I was too scared. But now, I'm recovered, we've left. And i hope i never see him again.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by someone I thought was my best friend he put his hand up my skirt, grabbed and slapped my ass etc I told myself everyday and still do that I’m being dramatic if you’re reading this you’re not overreacting if you think it was rape/sexual assault then it probably was :(",,
"I was 15 and a boy, 16, in the year above attended a birthday party of my friends. I had a couple of drinks, but I wasn’t drunk. Fast forward to later on in the night, I was sat on the sofa, the party was in the garden, but I went into the living room to just have a minute (I get stressed out in loud spaces) he followed me in there. No one else was in there. He came and sat next to me, asking if I was alright, asking if I could dance with him, I told him to just give me a minute to myself and I’d be back in the garden. He got closer, started running his hand up and down my leg, I asked him to get off of me and that it made me uncomfortable, he then started putting his hand up my dress, saying “why? Do you not like this then?” I tried to get up off the sofa, he pulled me down, I was 9st7 and he was about 16st. He pulled me into the sofa, I shouted get off and he grabbed my face with one hand, my waist with another. He was kissing me, despite me crying and squirming he wouldn’t stopped kissing me, moving his hands up and down my body. He only stopped because a good friend of mine came in to see if I was ok. Afterwards, he told me I should be grateful because my ‘lumpy body’ and ‘fat legs’ were disgusting for him to grab. I was a size 8. It made me develop an eating disorder, I was scared of my own male friends, this was 4 years ago, and it still haunts me. 4 years ago, a size 4, and a mere 113lbs later, I still have nightmares. I told my form tutor, who asked me if I’m sure that was what happened, if I was getting confused, if I was drunk and ‘regret getting with him’, it came out a year ago that he was messaging underaged boys. The school didn’t care, he walked the school corridors like nothing happened."",I was told by my headteacher was that “I had treated [the headteacher] like dirt” by coming out with my story. I hope with all my heart the school changes for the better.",,
I was asked to pick something from the floor and as I bent over a hand went up my skirt. I was also always moved to the front of the class so there was a better chance of looking up my skirt. I was constantly asked if I had a boyfriend and If we had done more than kissing.,,
I’ve been followed by older men more times then I can count. I’ve been forced to do things with boys when I’ve told them serval times I’m not interested and they never got the ideas. I don’t go out alone EVER anymore because of that,,
"A boy kept touching my leg under the table multiple times after being asked to stop, the teacher told me to stop being a tease then because I had my sleeves up",,
When I was about 17 I met guy who worked in the city. I thought he was cool. He was in his mid 20s and he gave me a lot of cocaine (which i had never tried before) and we went back to this flat. This was the second time I’d ever had sex and I asked him to put a condom on. he said he would when he was close to cumming and because I was drunk and coked and inexperienced I thought this was kind of okay. When we were having sex he repeatedly said ‘you’re so young’ and then finally he says he’s about to cum and asks me for permission to do it inside me. I really didn’t want him to but he persisted kept asking until I said okay. Afterwards he got really distant and the following day I woke up not knowing where I was and went alone to get the morning after pill. At the time I laughed about it and didn’t understand why my friends were concerned. I think I was trying to convince myself that it was fine because I had said it was okay and how was he to know that I didn’t want it when I said otherwise. Thinking about it now a few years on I realised that this wasn’t okay at all and I think my relationship with sex has been strange ever since.,,
I was 13 and decide to stay the night and my now ex boyfriends house with his cousin and and other friends who I thought I could trust . I was laid in the bed my boyfriend on my right and him on the left. I fell asleep and woke up to a person who I thought I could trust hands down my pants . I froze and could do anything I just stayed silent for what felt like hours until the alarm went off to wake everyone up . I had never felt so much relief hearing that alarm. I told no one because I didn’t know what it was and pushed it aside. It took me a few years to actually raise what had taken place that night. Obviously I’m no longer in constant with anyone form that Night,,
i do not feel safe and i’m always being harassed,,
I said no I said stop they didn't listen,,
When I was 8 years old I was sexually abused by a classmate. This carried on for the next two years. Teacher knew this was happening as he did it during lesson time and they could see his hands under the table touching me. No one did anything and the boy left the school to move outside of the city so no one could trace him to talk to his parents.,,
"There was this boy that liked me a lot, and we had gotten off a few times previously at other gatherings. One night I was really intoxicated, on the verge of passing out, and this guy said he’d take me on a walk to help me feel better. He lead me into the forest and sat me under some tree. I fell unconscious, and I’m pretty sure he was aware. He started kissing me and touching me inappropriately. I managed to get away from him somehow and got to my friends for help. As soon as I told them, someone told me that it wasn’t deep since I wasn’t raped, some friends even told me that I should wait till he apologises and start dating him. I started feeling guilty and thinking I was a shitty person because I felt so violated over something that was apparently so insignificant. I confronted the guy the next week, and he gave me some bullshit excuse about how I moved my lips so he thought I was kissing him back etc. A few of my male and female friends are still friends with him, and they’ve told me that they don’t think the situation is that bad because I wasn’t raped. I still to this day doubt myself about why this hurt me so much and think maybe I’m overreacting.",,
"I’m 26 years old now but When I was year 10 in 2010 I was the victim of sexual assault and violence, this happened in the school grounds. Once these allegations came to light and a conviction for the perpetrator happened; I was treated differently, mostly by the male members of staff.",,

The discourse (myself included) was less focused on condemnation for the sex crime that had occurred and more of the (what we saw as humorous) outlandishness of the attempt to do such a thing or the so-called unknown 'grass' or guy who 'baited' him (discussed perplexity on why he would do that etc)."",“It genuinely makes me feel violently ill how I used to spend time with those boys. I always remember finding it so weird how they treated girls so badly and still had this squad around them, I realise now that they used/use money and status to emotionally manipulate the people around them. This is a different type of story but I once got invited clubbing when we were like 15 and we were all arriving and they told the girls to wait outside. About 10 minutes later some random guy came and got us and lead us downstairs. When we walked to the table, all the boys were just sitting around and watching us walk in one by one. They just stared and looked us up and down, making it pretty obvious wether or not they were interested in you. I’ve never felt like such a piece of meat. I voiced my opinion about how I thought it was really weird and shock, I never got invited again. I really feel like punching them all in the face right now.”,""Since I started going clubbing at the age of 17 I remember being groped by men that were nearly always older than me. It was terrifying because I couldn’t see their faces as it was so dark and everyone was so close together.",,
"Outside [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] station my best friend passed out from havin too much too drunk hit her head and got a concussion we were with a group of guys who we did pres with and they all ran off when she was on the ground unconscious . I found a nurse and she told us to take off our jackets and goodies to make sure she was warm and I was going to a party so I had a kind of revealing top on but not super revealing I was so out of it I couldn’t even remember but two separate men came up behind me grabbed my boob and walked off and I’m not talking about boys, I’m talking about MEN 35 yo and 50 yo . I didn’t notice as I was too gone but the nurse and the tube guy started making this massive deal , getting people to chase them looking at security cameras and next thing I knew the nurse was landing me her phone with the police on it asking for a statement . I was so happy people were there to look out for me I wish I had that in other times I’ve been assaulted. I know it’s not rape or pressure into it but the amount of times strange men who are old who grabbed my bum or tried to squeeze my boobs in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is crazy I was 14 , and no one usually ever said anything",,
"I went over to my friends house and there were 2 guys and 3 other girls. I was sitting on the bed and one of the guys came up to me and put his hand on the inside thighs. I moved away because I felt uncomfortable but he kept on doing it. I got up but he pulled my back down. I managed to get up and I left my friends house saying my mum had called. The other girls weren’t in that room and even tho the other guy was there he didn’t say anything. I never told my friends because I felt like they would judge me and I didn’t think it was wrong since the guy didn’t say anything. Looking back on it, it was wrong of him.",,
"Guy at a party pretended to be drunk to make me comfortable and tried to gw me but I got away. later that night I was trying to sleep at abt 4am bc it was my friends house and he came in and crawled onto the bed saying he wanted to ""keep me company"". Luckily a male friend came in and joined us and chatted with me and then stayed all night but the guy was just sitting at the end of the bed. A few weeks later I found out that he both had a gf at the time, and that he further told his friends that he wasn't even drunk he was just pretending to be.",,
in my school these older years are taking pictures and sexualising them. And also older years are saying nice arse and saying show me your boobs. And he grabs my arse and says give it to me babe. i hate this to this day,,
"Me and this guy dated for around 2 months and it started off fine he was really nice (too nice) at the start then it all started to go down hill. he kept asking for nudes he wouldn't take no for a answer, I tried to ignore it and make up excuses for why he was acting like this. He wouldn't stop and one day I gave in to shut him up. That was the biggest mistake of my life after that day he started touching me weather that be outside of school at my friend's house or in class at break time at lunch time he just wouldn't stop and no one really cared. I kept pushing him away trying to use all my strength I had in me to keep me away from him I'd pull my hand away when he'd forced me to touch his boner in front of my friends. He'd force me to sit on his lap and kiss him all day when I was out with my friends. This became more aggressive over time to the point where I'd beg my friends to never leave me alone with him. If we were going to hand out id make sure I'd wear something baggy but he'd always find away to sexualize me. I eventually broke up with him and word got around that we'd split because he was so popular. He twisted the story for his benefit he told all his friends and anyone who asked that I broke up with him because I lost feelings for him. Yesterday I told the school about it they only cared for the photos I'd sent him even when they called my mom to tell her they just forgot to tell her about what he did to me they only told her about the photos. I've been advised to call the police if it got any worse by Monday (school are gonna call his mom and tell him but they don't know how he's gonna take it)",,
"I was with some friends from school celebrating my GCSE summer. We went clubbing in Greece and my friends parents came with us to make sure we were okay. I don’t drink so I’m always careful of guys around and protecting my friends who drink. That night tho I was just dancing with my friends and a guy and three of his friends were all staring at me and my boobs and danced their way over to me. I was always taught to be grateful for any male attention as a form of flattery so I decided to dance with one of the guys. He grabbed my waist so quick that I lost my balance and fell onto him while he held me onto his hard dick. I couldn’t get out of his grip and his friends were all laughing. I felt so violated and cried and shook the whole night. The crazy thing is I told a few of my friends months later and they related to me, telling me all their stories of guys putting their fingers down their pants. I’m shaking writing this right now and it’s been almost two years. I support anyone who has had to go through any form of sexual assault- big or small.",,
"I have been sexually assaulted by 3 different people this year alone all in school. But all together 4 different people. I'm just feel numb, starting to get use to it :(",,
"The [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] has about the worst rape culture of any school I know. The horrifying stories are not mine to share, but I please ask that state schools will be included in this too. It’s not just the private schools with issues. There is no sex education whatsoever at this school- never mind any talk about consent!!! There is too much focus on the religion of the school, with little understanding that everyone is still just a teenager that really really needs to be taught about consent, respect in boundaries. It is appalling, and it shows in so many things people do and say.",,
"I was walking to school to get covid tested before our return from online lessons, so I wasn’t wearing our classic dress code and didn’t have a school bag.essentially i didn’t look like a pupil. a group of builders were standing, smoking on the same road. i walk past as normal until they are behind me and as they stare as i walk past i hear them all cat call me, (aggressively). then i get to school (the end of that road), and see these same men doing work in our building. i go to an all girls school where these types of men walk around near us all the time. in another instance, when i was 13, i was on the way to a party on the tube and was sitting on a seat by myself. i was with a friend who was down in a different carriage because we had gotten into an argument. a man (after standing and staring at me for a while) sat down next to me (uncomfortably and unnecessarily close), eventually put his hand on my vagina and rubbed me. it happened so fast that before i could register the situation and react he had gotten up and left.",,
"When I was 15 was on a plane with my family but we were all separated because those were the only tickets left. This man (around 60) with his 5 year old daughter came and sat next to me. His wife was a few rows ahead. I put my seat belt on, and his seat belt was very clearly next to him. Without warning he reached under my bum and felt around for it for a a while. It obviously wasn’t there. I did nothing because I was shocked and his child was right next to him. Even if he thought I was sitting on it he could have got me to stand up but he just reached under with no warning and didn’t apologise or look uncomfortable for the rest of the journey. I had to sit next to him for the next 2 hours. I was shocked, confused and scared not only for me but this little girl, and that means I can’t even imagine what others who experience worse feel like.",,
"I lost my virginity to rape at the age of 14. I was ashamed and disgusted with myself and couldn't tell anyone. I felt so dirty. He told people at school that we had shagged and they laughed about it. I couldn't talk about it for years. It affected my relationships for years and I found sex frightening at times, even when it shouldn't have been. Still now, decades later, it can affect me.",,
"I was put next to this boy in maths and it came up in the conversation that i was a lesbian. He then went on this sort of mission to “turn me straight”. My friends would overhear him in classes talking about how he was gonna turn me into a sex slave, yelling at me and my friends at lunch about how much he wanted to shag me. Every single day in maths he would interrogate me about my sexual life. I was out of school for three months and blamed by my guidance teacher for “overreacting”. I lost all my friends for months, am still failing half of my classes for missing so much and he’s thriving. He’s started sitting near my new friend group again.",,
Ever since year 7 boys have been trying to or have touched mine or other girls. It still carries on and i’m now almost 15,,
"I was touched by my step brother, he was 13 at the time and i was 11. He came on me when i was “sleeping” i had faked sleeping a lot so that my dad would go to sleep and I could stay up all night. He would try to kiss me. I pushed him off every single time but one time he got to strong. He even tried to have sex with me. I pushed him off the bed, i still havnt told anyone to this day.",,
I was just chilling with a guy who kept on begging me to have sex and I kept on saying no as I didn’t want to lose my virginity to a guy I don’t know properly and he was like how it will not matter if I lost my virginity to him and started to touch my body very disgustingly without my consent and start begging more and more even if I kept saying no,,
"So many of these stories are concerning private school boys, but it’s not just them. I was 16 he was 18, I have never felt comfortable enough to call it ‘rape’ but I was sexually assaulted. I have always felt it was my fault for inviting him round or not making myself clearer when I said no. Every time I walk into my bedroom I can see myself pinned down by him, unable to move, my bed is a constant reminder of that day. Recently he tried to message me again, to ‘chat to me’, as he is still completely unaware of how wrong what he did was. I didn’t go to the police because he was over 18 and I had a sense of guilt of potentially sending him to prison, I regret that everyday. If I have to think about what he did to me most days, he should be locked away being forced to think about it everyday.",,
We would repeatedly get told by one of your teachers to bend from the waist when picking up objects from the floor and would tell the girls off when we didn’t bend from the waist but never told off the boys for it. He would stand behind us or would drop our pens on the floor. Then another time a friend had worn a pink bra under her shirt and was told to change it as it was distracting our teacher,,
"I was only 14 when a boy in my science class kept touching my inner thigh and tried to finger me in a lesson. I dropped my pen to get out of this situation. A few months before, he asked to meet me and we were only friends. He said can we kiss and I said no I don’t want to but he ignored this and still kissed me and groped me boobs.",,
I was raped by my boyfriend in my school bathroom,,
"my grandpa used to touch me when I was little and I never knew what it was ,I thought it was normal",,
I was 8 years old when my boyfriend grinded his crotch against my bottom.,,
I was assaulted by a teacher repeatedly who groomed me into thinking I was special. I was a 14 year old boy and he was in his 50s. He did it to someone else who reported it to the school and the teacher resigned and moved to Thailand. The authorities were never involved. I spent so long seeing it as something special that I didn't see it for what it was until years later. I never spoke up and wish I did.,,
"I was only 15 I consented to it because I thought he was the same age turns out he was turning 17 a week later, he was grooming me",,
Looking over the years this school has had its fair share of sexual assaults and it is never dealt with or confronted.,,
"i was year 7, and one of my male teachers always gave me a weird vibe, but i never really thought anything of it. one day after class he asked me to stay and told me i was failing history (i wasn't) and said he wanted to tutor me. as a twelve year old girl i never really thought anyhing of it, until he asked me to come to his house to tutor me. this is when i thought things were becoming a bit strange as i'm not sure teachers are actually allowed to do that but i didn't want to fail. so we went to his and his wife and kids wern't home, this is when i started thinking about the situation properly. anyway, so far nothing has happened, and then he decided to move his chair closer to me and started rubbing my inner thigh. i tried to ignore him and keep studying but then he attempted to take off my shirt, visibly uncomfortable i said i was going home now. he gets up, locks the door and pushes me onto his sofa. at this point i realised what was happening so i tried to push him off me, but unfortunately it didn't work. he ends up taking my clothes off whilst im shouting and crying, begging him to leave me alone. he put his hand over my mouth and started shouting at me, i was doing everything i was capable of doing to get him off me, about 4 months later i tell my parents and they didn't believe me. anyway, when i turned 16 i got him arrested, he lost his job, and i shagged his wife.",,
"There was a horrible culture amongst the boys at my school, and if things happened to me i’m sure they happened to plenty of other girls who have never told anybody- like me. I remember one time in particular when I was on the school bus, sat next to a boy I don’t even know the name of. We weren’t communicating in any way, i was just on my phone when he started touching my leg and lifting up my skirt. I was too scared to say anything, instead i got off the bus early and had to walk 40 minutes to get home.",,
"I attended [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] from [dates omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and I was forced to leave early from the school from the outrageous amount of bullying and sexual harassment I received from peers over the years. The thing that I am most upset about is that the school blamed me as a victim instead of the perpetrators for their actions, which was the issue. I as a 13-14 year old young girl didn’t deserve the sheer amount of bullying and sexual abuse from boys in my year circulating sexual videos of me without my consent and slut shaming me for being raped (the same boys were trying to sleep with me) I am angry about the fact that the staff at the time and the school as a whole didn’t deal with the situation as they should’ve of done. I was vulnerable and I even remember at one time an English teacher blamed me for other peoples actions. I had older years physically assaulting me in the school premises when school should have been a safe environment for me to feel comfortable in. The school failed me and I am still currently in therapy right now. I sent them a petition so other young girls/ boys don’t go through the same things as I did. I know they can’t do anything for me now but I hope they change the way they educate children on consent/ sexual harassment, so what I went through doesn’t happen to other young people.",,
"I was 15 and had just started seeing my boyfriend. We were messaging and joking around about this unflattering photo of me that my friend had sent him (not in a mean way). I messaged my boyfriend “yeah it’s my best angle” and he messaged back saying “no this is”, and sent me a photo of me in underwear lying on the bed and facing away from him, which I had no idea he’d taken. A few weeks later, he was scrolling through photos and I realised he had saved underwear photos I had sent him on Snapchat (where the messages disappear) without me knowing. I brushed it off and was with him just under a year, and when we broke up I asked him to delete the photos I had sent him (a lot of which he was quite pressuring about), to which he replied “maybe you shouldn’t have sent them if you didn’t want me to save them”.",,
Grouped in the hallway,,
"I was raped by a drug dealer who was in my “close friends” friend group. All the boys and not to forget the girls called me a liar and said i wanted attention. This disgusting person had raped other girls in the friendship group when they intoxicated and they are still so close to him till this day. Which makes me so angry and i feel so stupid.,At my old school Would be called a porn star by all my “guy friends” because how my glasses looked on me.",,
"We went on a night out, we went to a friend’s house afterwards and this guy (a friend) offered to walk home with me once we all got kicked out. No hand holding no kissing no suggestion I wanted anything to happen. When we got back to mine he asked to come in and we were sat in the living room, he then wanted to chill in my bedroom - still no kissing or anything, and as my housemates hadn’t been out I thought it would be more polite for them. One thing led to another in my room, and I said no I didn’t want to have sex. But he proceeded. He left afterwards and the next morning my friends asked how my night was and I burst into tears telling them how much I didn’t want to do it. I stopped talking to all my guy friends who remained friends with him after that night.",,
"During year 7, the boy I sat next to would touch my under the table. He would make moaning noises in my ear and when telling him to stop he would touch you again. I’d often feel his leg wandering up mine. His hand on my thigh I didn’t tell anyone and don’t feel I will. I was 11. This is not okay. And it will stick with me forever",,
Was groped by a grown man when I was 14 on a busy tube. Lasted for about 5 mins and either nobody noticed or nobody cared.,,
I had a best friend (a girl and I m a girl too) She asked me out but that time I liked someone so I rejected her and I couldn’t see her more than a friend. We then carried on as best friends and had a few sleep overs til one night she woke me up and started deep kissing me and touching me. I really didn’t know what to do and I m just scared of people now. Please know everyone can do things to you even if they’re a girl or a boy.,,
"I think I only realised now that I was indeed, sexually assaulted, again. I was in year 9 at the time when I met him. He was really nice and we got along well, used to chat to hi, in the hallways between classes and hang out before class, meaningless conversation. But then halfway through the year it changed. He started touching me, around my waist, down my neck, down my back and my hair. I didn’t like it but I thought it was what friends did, right? The it got much worse. Rollover for year 9, 2 months of gcse subject stuff for year 10 prep. I was sat next to him in science and that’s when it started. He would wrap his leg around mine, run it up and down, put his hands up my skirt, up my thighs, tried touching my area. I told him to stop so many times and he kept going. One day I didn’t wear a jumper and he grabbed my bra strap at the back and started asking my size, and I told him to stop. He didn’t like that. He got worse, touching me more in my private area, on my stomach, tried getting up my shirt. Funny thing is the only reason I was moved away from him after those 2 months was because he started copying my work. Silky, isn’t it? And so our classes moved, and I’m now a finished year 11, but he was still in my maths class, and I still catch him watching me sometimes, and I wonder if he remembers, because I do, and I feel so gross and sick about it, so dirty.",,
"I just turned 15 and I get catcalled for having big boobs. Guys in my year screenshot any picture I take and send it to friends for money, I get messages constantly asking if I send and when I say no they threaten to post everywhere that I sent them nudes. I block them but they make more and more. I have had guys put their hand on my leg during school even when I said I wasn’t comfortable. My ex used to get drunk with me and try to get me to give him head and when I refused he would push me and hurt me.",,
I am a male. When I was 17 I was anally raped by a 29 year old man. When I was younger than that some girls circulated pictures of my penis in their school. Both have given me a fear of relationships and serious trust issues.,,
When I was a freshman I was followed into the restroom by a senior guy and held down and assaulted on the bathroom floor. He plays football for a very popular college team now-one that my family supports and every time I see him on the screen I feel so sick. I’m not the first girl and have talked to others with similar experiences,,
"My Ex was extremely emotionally abusive to the point where even my friends didn't recognise me for a long time, he would constantly tell me he could get any girl easily and made it seem like he was doing me a favour by being with me. Throughout the relationship he would force me to do things I said no to or wasn't comfortable with but I would always let it slide as I thought it was normal, I lost my virginity to him so I was also attached (age 15). About a year after we broke up he asked me to come and see him, at the ti me it seemed like a good idea as I never really had closure and was still hurt, I wanted answers. As soon as I saw him on the station platform I instantly regretted going and knew I was defiantly over him, I wanted to go straight home but I got on the last train and it was a two hours away from where I lived. When we got to where we where staying I was explicitly clear I didn't want to have sex or do anything sexual, I knew having been with him this wouldn't be a good enough excuse so I said I was on my period . He kept asking and asking to have sex and my answer remained the same. I said I was tied and was going straight to sleep so I could just wake up and leave to get the fist train home at like 5 am. He then said ""its fine you can just sleep and ill fuck you"", this was so disturbing I knew I wouldn't be able to properly sleep incase I woke up and he was having sex with me. So I put a tampon in incase I fell asleep so he would see and it would stop him, it didn't. He was a lot bigger than me so I want able to push him off, at some point in the night he just got on-top and started having sex with me. I instantly froze and just lay there with my eyes closed waiting for it to be over, after about 10 mins he stopped as he could see I was unresponsive and silent. Dating him and this experience has damaged me for life, it took me a long time to be touched after as I felt disgusting. The worst part is I blamed myself for another 6 months for even going, its only after reading so many other confessions that I realise its not my fault and that you are always able to change you're mind and say no regardless of the situation.",,
"I was at one of my close friend's party and was dancing with some friends. This boy I had not seen for two years ended up in the same city as me by coincidence. We had gone on a holiday two years earlier but he had not spoken to me the whole time we were there and I did not know him at all. I saw him at the party and said hello out of politeness and then went back to my friends, later on in the evening I realise he is in the same part of the room as me and he slowly starts getting closer and closer behind me until he is so close behind me that my whole body is pressed against him and his hands are on my hips and then slowly they started moving down, the party was not busy enough for him to be that close to me without forcefully putting himself there. I always thought that if anything ever happened to me I would be able to stop them and say something but in the moment I couldn't and I was scared. The friend I was with was quite drunk and the music was loud and she couldn't hear/understand me when I asked her to switch places with me a couple of times in an attempt to escape him, so I was stuck. Eventually a male mutual friend ended up near me and I grabbed his arm and made him switch places with me and I managed to move away. I told my other friends and one of them went over to him and said that he had been touching me without my consent and he laughed it off and said that it was ok because he used to know me. we had never been friends. he felt entitled simply because he knew my first name. a few months later he messaged me on snapchat saying ""hey x"" and I didn't reply but I am now scared that I will see him by coincidence and the same thing will happen and I will be too scared to say anything.",,
Once at a house party I had drunk too much and wasn’t in control of myself. I was lying on a bed upstairs with a guy’s hand down my pants. A ‘friend’ filmed this and put in on her public story for all of my friends to see.,,
"i believe i might of been 5 when it started but i don’t have a very strong recollection of the events over the next 2 years as the trauma has resulted in blocking out these memories as best as possible. i was sexually assaulted by an older family member but was unable to even tell that this was wrong because of how young i was, so i didn’t speak to this about anyone until the age of seven. what would happen was when my parents were working late i would sleep round their house with my sister. i would sleep in the mans bed as i was always very cold and unable to fall asleep in my own bed. he took advantage of that situation and took advantage of me. when i told my parents they took immediate action and cut all ties off with them. police would come and visit me to talk about the situation but i still didn’t understand what happened. i don’t think i understood the danger of the situation until i reached the age of around 11.",,
"When I was 14 some older boys invited me to a little party, they played beer pong with me and cheered me on into drinking a lot, I was very drunk and lay down on a sofa and passed out, when I came round someone’s penis was in my mouth.",,
"I joined a very well known school in the north of England in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. There were 12 girls in my year and about 150 boys. As we arrived for interview, we were marked out of 10. To my knowledge, there was no sexual violence, but girls were encouraged to behave in an unladylike manner. If one had not got a boyfriend one was frigid. The idea was to kiss a “quota” of boys through the time there. There were regular skirt lifting exercises. There were rumours that many of us did not wear knickers to school. The girls were regarded and treated as less intelligent. All very difficult to pin down and very much was inferred rather than said, but it was deeply sexist. There was no pastoral care. It gave many of us a lack of confidence to say “no” so we just went along with it. I have a daughter. I NEVER want her to feel as though she can’t say NO!",,
"The school only accepted girls in the sixth form, and while the head teacher went out of his way to encourage girls with straight A grades to join, I was then treated like a second class citizen for two years. It was a deeply mysogonistic institution, and feedback from one teacher at parents evening to my mum was that ""she'll never be one of our boys"". There was absolutely no emphasis on the fact that the male students should treat female students with respect, and I was groped in the corridors a number of times. I felt my entire social standing at school was based on my appearance, and boys I didn't even know felt entitled to loudly discuss my appearance. The culture meant that female students were objectified and dehumanised.",,
"Sexually assaulted, touched up in class, by multiple boys in my year. The school boards, didn’t do anything about it. They dismissed it on account of the boys being “good” and not likely to do something like that.",,
"Nothing to do with a UK school or uni since it was an online thing and the guy was American but I was probably 11/12 and I think the guy was 17/18. At first I was just chatting to him as a friend but then he wanted me to send nudes and I was so uncomfortable doing so and I made it very clear to him that I didn’t want to but he manipulated me and guilt tripped me into sending him nudes and I was a naive child so I did but I felt awful afterwards. I was in a group chat with a bunch of online friends and I had managed to piss him off about something so he got in contact with my online friends and leaked the nude, I was so embarrassed and had to pretend it wasn’t mine. For years I felt so afraid that he might show the picture to my irl friends or family",,
"I don’t know if this counts as sexual assault but it is just something really creepy that happened at my school. We have a door between the Girls and Boys PE changing rooms that is sealed up and locked so that no one can get through. But one day whilst we were getting changed for PE, some boys deliberately burst the door open (baring in mind some of us hadn’t fully changed yet) and they pushed a boy into the changing rooms (who put his hands over his eyes and quickly went back into the changing rooms). Literally nobody did anything until a couple hours later at lunchtime when one of the girls who saw everything happen went over to a female teacher (lets just call her Miss X) and explained everything (This teacher is one of my favourite and actually cares about the students). Miss X went and told our head of year, a male PE teacher, and he basically did nothing. When some girls were called up to his office with Miss X to give a statement about what happened, this teacher defended the boys and said something about them opening the door by accident or that it wasn’t locked properly and that they must have just fell into the door. Turns out that obviously he was wrong and when he came to apologise to the girls he said that he loves his boys too much and that’s why he was defending them? The boy who did it got put in seclusion for a day or two- but then again we didn’t expect much since the teachers sweep everything under the rug at our school.",,
"When I was 13, I was play fighting with an ex at the time. We weren’t exactly close friends anymore, but I didn’t mind. He took an item of mine so I did the same thing, just average banter. When we exchanged items again, he told me that if I did it again he’d rape me. I immediately panicked, I didn’t even know how to feel. My face got hot and I could feel my eyes watering. My teacher wouldn’t let me see my head of year even though I could tell I was on the verge of a panic attack. I had to wait an hour to leave class, and when it ended I quickly explained to my friends where I was going so I could look for him. I couldn’t find him, and at that point I was shaking and in tears, so I hid in the toilets and messaged my mum. I’m not gonna lie, I was terrified. I didn’t know if he would actually do it, saying inappropriate things was in his nature, but this was very extreme. My mum messaged back instantly and called me multiple times, before calling she school distressed. They came and found me, took me out of class and spoke to me and the boy separately. He lied about it. No one heard it, and the distance between us made it hard to believe. I felt so invalidated, as if he could get away with anything and no one would believe me. After the incident, he would push me around or even make comments about me to his friends, and though I reported it he would deny. When they caught one incident on camera, he said it was an accident as he pushed other people too. Even after the police got involved, he denied it, and his mother even accused me of bullying the boys stepfather and sending gifts to their home. I asked for my class to be moved and they did, after suggesting I move. This led me to believe it was my fault. Even my head teacher told me it was my fault for being out of my seat and taking his stuff. To this day I hate seeing his face, it makes me feel sick. They just dismissed how I felt and how they saw me break down due to ‘lack of evidence’.They closed the case.",,
"I was pulled aside during class by the teacher.I didn’t know what was going on but he lead me into his office and he touched me in places that i did not want to be touched.He did inappropriate stuff to me.I was only 14 so I had no clue what was going on.Now that i think about it, I just wish i didn’t go to school that day.I tried to tell the headmaster but he just wouldn’t listen to me.The teacher didn’t even get fired.In fact, he still works there to this day.",,
it was my boyfriend. I hadn’t shaved that day and didn’t want him to see. He pulled my pants down whilst i was fighting him off and saying no. We then had sex. I never said no but I didn’t say yes either. He pressured me into it.,,
Boy is known for sexually assaulting/ raping girls. He has done it to many people I know. He is manipulative and has blackmailed people if they try to say something.,,
"A guy I was dating, misled me to believe he was wearing a condom when we slept together. He also pressured me into sleeping with him after our first date.",,
"At a party when I was 14 a boy came up to me and started kissing me, I went along with it. He shoved me against the wall and started rubbing himself on me, i pushed him off and told him to stop. He told me i'd given him blue balls and it was painful and i HAD to touch him. i said no. He slammed me up against the wall and told him I had to touch his penis, which he had taken out his pants. I started crying. He started touching himself while holding me against the wall, then ejaculated all over me. I ran into the bathroom crying and covered in it. A few years after leaving school I was speaking to a girl in the year above me who had also had an unpleasant experience with this boy and knew of two other girls who also had unpleasant experiences.",,
I would sit in assembly or lesson and the boys would put the heads up my leg and try to finger me through my tights,,
"It’s not exactly student-on-student rape culture but when I was in year 3 (7 years old) the school made us submit to a ‘medical examination’ in which the ‘doctor’ felt around our genitalia for about 10 minutes (it was an all boys school). When I flagged it with the schools DSL and Headmaster i was told by the DSL it was ‘perfectly normal’ (it wasn’t) and by the headmaster to ‘shut up’. A year later I reported it to the police who followed up with a 2 year investigation which led to nowhere - no charges brought against those involved. The doctor however does have restrictions in place over his contact with minors and is being investigated for misconduct by the GMC, so at least it doesn’t feel a total waste. There’s more to it which I’d be happy to discuss in private messages.",,
somebody touched me in my private area,,
I was only 15 and he used to tell me everyday how rapeable i looked and how it would be so easy to do so. I hated going to school everyday.,,
This is nothing in comparison to other stories but a female teacher at school once called me out in front of the whole class for wearing a short skirt. I don’t remember her exact words but it was a skort and we don’t have a uniform and it made me feel really embarrassed and uncomfortable.,,
My year 9 (shell) geography teacher/ hockey coach on the way back made me take the hockey balls back to his apartment and invited me in and offered me orange juice and it was awkward to say no so i Went in and I felt really uncomfortable and he commented about my skirt so I left but felt uncomfortable for my entire shell lessons.,,
"I went to a friend’s party, feeling secure because this friend only invited a few people (all girls). She ended up inviting a guy who invited four of his close friends, which at the time I was mutuals with the majority of these guys (except one). The guy I didn’t know was a year older than us and was close friends with someone I thought was my friend. This guy kept flirting with me so I made it clear that I was not interested, however, he did not care. He just moved on to another girl and started to flirt with whoever he could try and get. Later that night he touched me and I yelled. I left that party early and later told my friend (her and another girl also said he touched them). I was scared to tell my close friend about what happened because he said that the guy was like his brother. I ended up telling him and he said he already knew. He seen and did absolutely nothing. I spoke out about it anonymously and soon, people would start to realize the type of person he is however no justice has been served. He said, “I don’t want to ruin my reputation so you cannot talk about this.” To him, it was merely his reputation.",,
"I was pulled into a empty classroom by two older boys who were much stronger than me, teachers had seen the boys pull me and they did nothing. After they pulled me into the classroom they yelled at me quietly to take off my clothes and they kept yelling until I did what I was told, they hit me multiple times and people passing the classroom did nothing. I went home crying and my parents’ attention stayed on my siblings. They didn’t ask what happened to my face or anything. That was the day I started cutting myself.",,
At school we had a skirt check and a male teacher was in charge of it . Whilst doing it he made the comment ‘ 16 year old me would have been loving this ‘ infront of a group of 15/16 year old girls who stood there feeling shocked and vulnerable,,
This time when I was in year 8 I had recently gotten Snapchat. I had added some family friends and we quickly got talking. One of the boys I added was in year 10 and a very good family friend of ours. One night we were talking and he coaxed me into sending his nudes by saying stuff like ‘just for me’ and ‘come on stop being a prude’ so I sent him some pictures. This memory scarred me forever because it felt so wrong to be sending this picture and made me feel uncomfortable every time I saw him.,,
"When I was just 15 (male) I was at a party and a girl started pushing me against a wall and rubbing herself against my dick. I did not like her and told her to stop, she continued and took me to another room. She forced my pants off and started to undertake sexual activities with me. I have never seen her again and it might have been a one-off thing but unacceptable nonetheless.",,
"From my time at school, there was a heavily ingrained culture of sexism and misogyny. ‘Slap a bum day’ was commonplace as were the offensive and derogatory names that me and the girls I knew were called daily."",6. Other behaviour considered “normal” relating to bum slapping/grabbing, shouting out, comments. Less now I’m older.",,
"i was 11, it happened multiple times by my ex boyfriend who happens to be one of my classmates. never raped in school but sexually assaulted. i was raped multiple times by him, on april 24th in the woods, may 2nd, 3rd and 8th at his house and 14th at my house. he would manipulate and beg me into doing things with him until i had to. even on my birthday he raped me in my own house. i didn’t realise until the july after it happened. i was so disappointed in myself for not sticking with my no answer but i had to stop blaming myself and i had to tell one of my friends. first i told one of my best friends, we’ll call him oliver, he was shocked, i told him everything but not in too much detail so that i could tell my other best friend, we’ll call her charlotte, then i told my charlotte and i told oliver in a bit more detail that before and since we’re all massive feminists we started planning how we were gonna tell my mother or one of the teachers at our school. we still haven’t done that yet, we’re doing it this friday hopefully, i just want him to realise what he’s done is wrong and that he gets in a lot of trouble for doing what he did to me.",,
The worst thing about my sexual assault story was that after it had happened my ‘best friends’ lgot the guy to call me and say he would take me to the abortion clinic if I needed to go- at school the next day I then had to sit and listen to all of my friends talk about how sweet and nice he was for offering this. I was made to say thank you to him even thought if he hadn’t sexually assaulted me I wouldn’t even have had to have been in that situation. My ‘best friends’ carried on being friends with this guy for years and years which I will never understand. Yes boys are the problem but there are also many many girls who stand by and do nothing about their close guy friends frequently sexually assaulting people.,,
In year 9 I met a guy at a festival and I had only got with a few people before him and hadn’t gone very far sexually. We got with at the festival and exchanged socials. When I got back to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] he messaged me asking to meet with his brother as he was staying at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and I don’t live far. We met up and him and his brother were on acid. He was 16 and I was 14. After going out for a bit we got the bud to his house with his brother and the whole time of the bus he was getting with me and pulling me so close to him which was just weird. When we got to his we very quickly went upstairs and did all the “stages” including 69- which I had no idea how to do but he was armament we were going to do it. We tried to have sex which I didn’t think I would do and didn’t particularly want too- and I was young and hadn’t done anything like this before so it didn’t go in properly. He kept trying to get it in and it hurt so much. I didn’t really know how to say to stop and just let it happen. I ended up bleeding on his sheets. He wasn’t comforting about any of this and I just went along with whatever he said. After we couldn’t have sex he said “all I wanted to do this summer was lose my virginity” and it was clear that was all I was there for. We tried to have sex again and it just hurt even more. He never once asked if I was okay with any of this or asked specifically for consent and I could see how annoyed he was that I couldn’t “help” him lose his virginity. I felt used and knew that I shouldn’t have done all of this stuff with him.,,
"I was in Yr 9 (13 years old) and had been invited to a yr 11 house party. I met this guy there who was in yr 12 and we chatted for a bit and i told him i was in yr 9 (so he fucking knew). later that evening when people were rly drunk (including me), i went outside for a cig and he was there at the end of the garden looking pretty drunk. i went to chat if he was alright and we ended up kissing. i was fine w it n kind of wanted to but then he put his hand down my shorts which was a complete first for me so i didnt know what to do. the next thing i remember is that we were behind this shed at the end of this garden and im on my knees sucking him off. i suddenly freak out and know i didnt want to do this so i stopped, he kept pleading me to finish him off for ages and i kept saying no. then luckily we heard someone coming so i took my chance and ran back to the party. once i was inside where everyone else was i started crying because i felt so bad for running off(!!) i was so confused because this was the first party with older people and i really looked up to them so i felt like i was being so selfish and rude saying no. people around me were saying i shouldnt worry n that hes a nice guy so their sure hed understand. they also said he hadnt actually been w many girls so it must mean he likes me. at the end of the night i felt so bad so i said sorry to him and got his snap hoping we cld chat more. it has taken me 3 years to realise how fucked that situation was and how everyone was acting as if it was fine.",,
"I was dating a guy in the year above me when I was 14, some of his friends had started having sex so he felt pressured to do the same (a problem in itself). I was over at his house and he pulled out a condom and said we should do it. I said no and he asked again and again, even saying “if you don’t want to we can just do anal” (?!). At one point he threatened to break up with me if I didn’t, and because I was scared of both him and all the boys in his year I said yes. It was horrendous, and he broke up with me the next day. It was years ago but I still have a lot of problems with giving consent / having sex because of how young I was and also because it’s been really hard to totally remove him from my life as we share a lot of friends",,
The fact that in the private school bubble it’s just accepted that some of the teachers are pedos and that’s the norm is insane,,
"I started to feel really uncomfortable going out with my girlfriend at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when both male locals and students would openly stare and make comments. A dozen times probably we were asked if they could ""join in""/ watch, and once some guy actually started touching me and trying to kiss us both.",,
From a young age (around year 9) lots of my guy friends would grope girls so casually and just joke about it - we would commonly be sexualised but it felt so normal at the time. They would also take pictures of girls cleavage etc.. whilst they weren’t paying attention or passed out and send them between friends and around school to trade other explicit pictures with their friends. It’s insane to think we thought this was so normal and now look back on it realising the reality of the situation.,,
He was sending pictures of his body to me. If I didn’t send something he threatened to slit his wrists. I was only 13-14 and he would say disgusting things to me about what his going to do to me. He was 100% fully aware I was uncomfortable and wanted him to stop. I’ll block him on all social media but he somehow found ways to contact me. I was in school sitting upstairs where he decided to come to me and touch my thighs. I told him to stop and pushed him off me when he came back and ripped my tights and tried to touch me. After trying to push him off he cut my inner thigh with his nails. He ran off when he heard a teachers heels walking down the hall and I sat there crying pretending nothing happened. I’m still traumatised today and I wish I just could go back and reported what he was doing to me because it was mentally and physically abusing me.,,
"I was in a domestic violence relationship with my ex partner few years back and got pregnant with a girl. The birth of my daughter was traumatic and had to have a c section. I ended up in ITU for a few weeks. When I come out, I was on antibiotics and strong pain medication, one off the day, while my newborn was asleep, my oldest was in her bedroom asleep, he wanted sex and I didn’t, he said when his ex gave birth and had sex afterwards with no problems. I kept telling him no I was in pain, he didn’t listen and slap across my face and then punch me, he force me back on to the bed and done what he want to do. The pain was too much to take, that while he doing it I was silently crying. Once he finished I went into the shower and use the bleach to clean my self. I didn’t report to the police due to the police had already failed to help the first time my ex was domestic violence towards me.",,
"It was a minor event but has led to a lifelong hatred for the Catholic Church. I was sent to boarding school from the age of 8 and I may well have been a real pain in the arse, an annoying kid that pissed off the monks running this small prep school in the South of England. However making me stand up in front of the whole school and take my trousers and pants down was not a nice thing to do. It is just a small thing and virtually all here have suffered worse but I would like to see the Catholic Church lose its gold, have it all melted down, lose its property and disappear. I grew up and was a less attractive kid / teenager and I am pleased because I went on to the senior school and there were predatory priests there.",,
"I was raped, in my student house, in my own room, in my bed after my own house party during my second month of university. I was asleep in my own bed alone. A friend of a friend decided he would stay and ‘look after me’, my friends left and I still don’t know why they left him, someone I didn’t know or speak to.. I woke up to him having sex with me. I felt like because i had one night stands before no one would believe me. He went back to his own house and bragged about his “first uni shag” to his housemates. And I’ve been left with this. Was i really raped? Is this rape? Does he even know he raped me??",,
"I was on a night out with my best friend, when a man approached me asking if I'd like a drink and to go for a cigarette. I agreed because I just liked being social after a couple of drinks. When getting this drink he was buying, I'm sure he must have spiked it then, or not long after. I was very suddenly within the next half an hour, extremely intoxicated, even though I hadn't had that many drinks, maybe 3/4 in total. He then started manipulating me into coming out of the club (which is located amongst lots of grounds and a golf course) and going for a ""walk"" with him. He said at the time he wanted to talk but without loads of noise. Eventually I agreed because I felt bad for saying no at first as he seemed upset.,We walked down towards an overflow car park that was for the golf course, and I couldn't even walk straight at this point. But he kept trying to talk me into getting frisky in the woods surrounding the car park. This was out of sight of the club by this point. He was holding onto me trying to convince me to, and I couldn't really focus from being so intoxicated.,I then returned to my best friend, who then said ""look at you, you cheeky minx"". To which I replied ""not really, you should have stopped me. I'm a mess now"" or something along those lines, and she then told me that I obviously wanted to go with him otherwise I wouldn't have gone.,I've never been able to even remember what the man looked like or what his name was. I remember some details only from piecing together information etc.,The day after that night, on a Sunday, I was coughing up blood. I had to attend an emergency clinic to be checked and it was confirmed I was spiked that night.",,
"nobody cared that she had touched me, ""calm down it happens all the time""",,
I told him no as he slipped his had down my jeans he said “it’s fine no ones here”,,
I wasnt raped but I think I was sexually assualted or groped im not sure? I was a 12 year old boy and by that time everyone knew I was gay and I was being bullied by a group of straight boys in my year and then a new year started and I was put next to one of them in my science class. It was fine for a couple weeks aside from the name calling and I guess at some point he decided it would be funny if he ran his hand along the inside of my inner thigh. He did this multiple times in the lesson and would just laugh when I squirmed in my seat and told him to stop but I was too ashamed to talk to anyone about this. This continued for a few weeks but eventually I told my teacher I wanted to move seats (I didnt give my teacher the reason why but my teacher did move me thankfully) This happened just under two years ago and I still think about it to this day.,,
"My primary school used to make us play this game. We had to line up girls and boys and the girls would create a tunnel for the boys to run through and when the music stopped, you would ‘trap’ the person in between your arms and kiss them. Then the boys would do the same and girls would run through. Even if I didn’t want the kiss, the boys would still kiss me on the cheek. Participation of the game was forced.",,
"I was first sexually assaulted when I was 11, returning on the tube home from school. It has been a constant fear and, upsettingly, often reality over the last 12 years of my life. I was raped at 21, and am still in therapy for PTSD. I still get triggered, and find myself panicking when a man sits nexts to me or comes too close. I am having to unlearn a fear of intimacy and sex, yet every time I feel as if I’m making progress, another man will harass / assault me, putting me back at square one. I am afraid of men. Sending love to everyone who has been sexually harassed or assaulted - it is not your fault.",,
"When I was 14 I went to a school reunion and everyone got drunk. It was maybe the first or second time I had been drunk, and some boys saw their opportunity. One put his hand down my pants and exposed me, while the other took photos. The ""photographer"" then shared those photos with people I went to senior school with. I have no idea how many people saw them, but I have no doubt they would have been shared far and wide. I never saw them myself, just heard from others. One boy even told me he was ""disappointed"" in me after he was shown them.",,
"been groped, had stuff sasid to me thats made me uncomfortable anf had boys moan and make sex noises in my face.",,
"I am a 77yr old woman. I worked in London in the [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I experienced indecent sexual assault in the London underground when I was fifteen, Rush hour was a nightmare, packed like sardines entering the station, men took the opportunity to grope and assault, they regularly exposed themselves on the trains and would rub themselves against you whenever possible. As a ‘Window Display artist’ I would see men ‘Flashing’ outside the window. I carried a hat pin when travelling late at night.,I was also a Publican for 20 yrs. during this period of my life, I endured misogynistic remarks also groping. I learned to live with this situation and accepted it as ‘normal’,Enough is enough, women need protection by law.",,
It was in secondary school when I was 16. Only 16 when I had my innocence and power taken away from me that day. He bum raped me.,,
"I got sexuall abused by my cousin for a good 4 years of my childhood , i dont remember much of it , i eventually told my mum and my brother and they said that it was fine cuz he was 13 and he prob didnt know",,
"i had a male friend who came to my house for the first time and after i repetitively said 'no' and 'please stop' he continued to groped me for two hours, pinned me down trying to kiss me, pulled me on top of him and tried to finger me. To him and his friends it was a joke and he told them that i wasn't up for any fun. The fact that i was that uncomfortable in my house is a horrible thought to me.",,
"I was regularly sexually harassed and sometimes assaulted by a group of boys in my overwhelmingly white and middle-class ‘nice’ comprehensive school. Bullying was rife and I never witnessed any teacher take any action to intervene. I didn’t feel safe at school. I don’t think anyone except the straight, cisgender boys did. They ruled the place.",,
"I wasn’t going to post anything because reading the testimonies on here brought a lot of painful memories to me that I didn’t want to share. But then I saw that the boy who shared my nudes across my whole year group had signed the open letter. Nearly 10 years later, the experience still affects me. I was diagnosed with PTSD after I left [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]; I remember when after a school trip, the fact my nudes were leaked was made known to the head of middle school. The fact this was a topic of conversation during the trip wasn’t even known to me until someone named a quiz team with reference to what happened to me. I was confronted in a meeting and threatened with suspension, so denied the fact I was being bullied. Less than a year before this happened to me, the school punished a girl in the year above me for the same thing. The school actively cultivated this culture of silence by punishing the victims time and time again, I’m glad the head of middle school when I was there is no longer at the school. But I’m concerned some of these men don’t have the self reflection and humility to realise just how central they were to perpetuating this rape culture at the school. Hold yourself accountable rather than jumping on the bandwagon for optics. You may be able to forget about what you did to me and pretend it didn’t, but I don’t get that privilege.",,
I was 13 a boy pressured me into sending him nudes. the next day everyone had them at my school and at other schools. the teachers found out and blamed me for sending them. my whole reputation was ruined and everyone was calling me a slut etc. the boy still hasn't been held accountable.,,
"I received a DM from this guy on Instagram. The conversation started and it seemed normal. About a week in he started to send unsolicited dick pics and I told him I felt uncomfortable with it. There was no apology, and he forced me to say that I liked it. He then became persistent and kept pestering me to send nudes, all the while I refused. I ended up giving in as I couldn’t find a way to shake him off.,He later revealed he had a girlfriend whilst he was talking to me in this way, and messaged details of an aggressive sexual fantasy that he had with me. He told me that he had my nudes stored on his phone and I am scared as to what he may do with them. I only recently realised that I wasn’t in the wrong, and I have blocked him. I only wish I had the courage to reach out to his girlfriend to tell her the truth.",,
"I was extremely drunk and with this boy. I was sitting next to him but I started to fall asleep so I was like half awake. He put his arm around me and started groping my tits for a really long time, I barely remember it my friends had to tell me it happened. He thought it was ok because I liked him but it really was not and I still think about it.",,
"In year 9 i got coerced into sending this boy I’d liked for time nudes. I really didn’t want to but i really liked him and didn’t want to risk him stop talking to me, which i realise sounds so stupid now. He screenshotted them and sent them to around about 150 people in the year at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The heads of both our schools ended up finding out, i was suspended and he was let off without anything not even a detention, even after a conversation with the police. For periods of time after it happened i was harassed by the girlfriend i didn’t know he had, who started spreading rumours about me that i was on the sex offenders list even though he was the one that should be on it above all.",,
"Knowing the boys that have these ""wank banks"" and knowing some of the girls that have become victims of them many without even knowing is genuinly disgusting and saddening.",,
"It was my first year at uni I had only met him once before and ended up in his room, I explicitly and repeatedly told him that I didn’t want to have sex with him. We were both drunk and the last thing I said before were “this is not happening, I don’t want to have sex with you tonight” and the next thing I know he is taking off my underwear. As far as I’m concerned he doesn’t have a clue and definitely doesn’t know how much it has affected me. It’s so much harder and scarier to say no and physically fight back when they’re so much bigger than you.",,
"I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a boy in my form group at school between the ages of 13 and 14. We both did a lot of music, and he would find me in a practice room and hold my arms down whilst he touched whatever he wanted against my consent. Our practice rooms had no windows, so he would target me there. He also knew I was quiet and could easily manipulate me into silence. I remember him laughing at me and calling me ugly in front of his friends, and then looking for opportunities to grope me when no one was around. It was so confusing and I didn't fully register the severity of what he was doing. I also remember him trying to slip his hands up my skirt in lessons when a teacher was talking from the front, knowing I would be too scared to speak out as I tried to push him away. It was 8 years before I told anyone any of what happened. Sometimes I still feel jumpy when alone with male friends. Like so many girls, I have experienced countless incidents of groping or cat-calling in the street or in clubs/bars, but these early experiences were somehow harder to shake. I was young and alone, and he was still a child himself really, yet he was so calculated and manipulative. It's chilling when you stop and think about it. I hate that still when I experience sexual harassment, people still ask 'what were you wearing? Did you encourage him?' No girl or woman is to blame for any sexual mistreatment she is subjected to, and maybe it takes people knowing that a 13 year old girl in her school uniform trying to make it through the day went through this for them to realise that. But mainly I am posting this here because I hope if we speak out loudly enough, we can stop other girls having to face what we have. I want to create a world where every girl knows she is priceless and beautiful, and is never treated otherwise",,
"I was drunk at the bus stop he told me to go back to his house to sober up, he kissed me I pulled away he held my neck and forced his dick into my mouth I tried to pull away he pushed me on to the bed and chocked me till I couldn’t breathe and had to literally tap out, he said it was what I wanted",,
"In year 10 in my maths lesson there was a boy who sat next to me. He was seen as one of the “cool boys” and we used to have good chats together. On the whole it was pretty fun. However, one lesson he put his hand on my thigh. I didn’t say no but I didn’t say yes either. But he took my silence as an ok it’s fine and would repeat my touch my legs and all the way up to my groin each week. I used to dread my lessons but never once told him no. I was embarrassed and confused and young.",,
I went to a teacher a few months after being sexually harassed and they said they weren’t concerned about it because the person who’d done it must have been in a ‘bad head space’ and they said that I was over reacting,,
"when I was 13 I was groomed online by a boy who was older than me. We began talking through a friend, and he began to emotionally manipulate me, eventually coercing me into sending explicit images and videos of myself. Whenever I would raise concerns, he would gaslight me, causing me to have serious trust issues and trauma until this day. Of course, at the time I did not understand the magnitude of the situation, and we even arranged to meet up to have sex (he convinced me this was normal; despite my large fears about it). As far as I am concerned, he still has the images of me as a 13 year old, and I have not spoken out publicly since due to this fact. I hope there will be more education about sexual violence online, because no girl or boy should have to suffer what I did.",,
"I believe I have been sexually harassed at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The boy slapped my behind with a ruler in class, the teacher was out and all his friends laughed. He also purposely brushed against my breasts multiple times and has made several inappropriate comments about me and my body although I haven't told anyone but this form, I would like the school to be known as other girls have experienced in too and some teachers as well.",,
"We’d been kissing for a few minutes when i felt a sudden jab. we didn’t know each other well, but i’d told him earlier i’d never had unprotected sex before and so i’d want him to wear a condom. but he had put his penis in me suddenly, and without wearing a condom. to be clear, protected sex later on if i had said yes would have been ok. it was hard to gauge how, or if, it was wrong at the time. i called him later to remind him that ‘he needed consent first’, then i wound up apologising for making him feel bad. after all, i hadn’t protested after he’d started, right? the worst part was that i knew someone else had already accused him of rape, and i believed him when he said she was ‘crazy’. i’ll never doubt a survivor again.",,
"Boys used to take advantage of my mental state and feed me alcohol until I was easy enough to do stuff with. This was boys that in the right state of mind I would’ve never touched, boys I don’t remember touching me, boys who would film me ect then I’d wake up feeling empty not knowing what had happened and then eventually get told",,
"i feel very unsafe at school.Almost everyday,i get males in my year looking down at my thighs,and i’ve even had multiple people touch me or try to touch me where i don’t want to be touched,and i have not consented to this.They also text me inappropriate messages and it makes me feel very uncomfortable about going to school",,
When I lived in London I was followed from the tube one evening. I was on quite a main road but had to turn onto a quieter road to go home. I weighed up whether ro keep walking so he didnt know where I lived but I didn't know where to head for so I turned to go home and sped up. He also sped up and as I put the key in the door he pushed behind me and forced his way in to the building. Before he sexually assaulted me he said he would leave if I let him do what he wanted. I eventually pushed him away with more force than I knew I had. This was by far the worst but not the only experience I have had of this type of behaviour.,,
"The boys' school chant at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is 'Jingle Balls' and has a line which goes 'so suck me off slowly you slag'. This 'tradition' is rape culture at its most obvious...."",Sitting on a sofa in a room, I was calling an uber after we all got back from a party. He came into the room and shut the door. I had just come out of a two and a half year relationship so was vulnerable and unaware.,At first we were chatting and then he kissed me. I thought nothing of it, maybe I was flattered. I’m not sure. He then started to tell me we were going to have sex. At first I wasn’t really scared, I thought by saying no that meant we wouldn’t. He started to get more aggressive and persistent so I got my phone to leave. He took my phone out of my hand and threw it across the room. At this point, my fear was kicking in. I felt under threat and unsure of how to protect myself because I knew he would have a physical advantage over me if he wanted to. He then began to force himself on to me and I resisted, pushing against him. Eventually I was begging him to stop and he turned me over face down. My clothes and shoes were still on and he ripped my tights down from behind me and forced himself into me. He gripped onto my neck with his hands strangling me and leaving bruises which were later recorded in a forensic medical examination.,Throughout the assault I resisted and pushed and begged. Until i gave up. I lay there while he aggressively forced himself inside of me, absolutely worthless. The terror subsided and I felt numb. After he finished he pulled out and told me I could go.,What he took from me that night I will never get back. I see men and I often feel scared. I don’t feel worthy to speak to men and I don’t feel like I deserve kindness from them. This is not because I am weak this is because of what he did. I never reported it to the police. I was too scared. I didn’t need more trauma or this to be public information. I know all too well, I would only ever lose.",,
"I was raped and sexually assaulted by pupils, soldiers on the base and a parent. I never reported it, as the blame was firmly put on me. I was bullied for being a slut and people that had assaulted me passed my name on to other people who did the same. Most of the girls had experienced this behaviour."",When he touched my breasts I immediately hit him, to which the teacher saw all of it and sent me to isolation where I got excluded for my behaviour, I tried to fight it, however they just stated that the boy had ‘issues’.",,
It was in y8 when one of my closest friends at the time touched me and made me do things I didn’t want to do. She made me not tell anyone because she was ‘embarrased’ and none of my friends know. It’s been a couple of years and I’m starting to believe that it doesn’t matter but it still effects me everyday and I have to ask as if nothings wrong. Luckily this girl had to move schools so I don’t have to face her everyday and be reminded of everything she put me through. She made me feel as if it’s my fault but I’m starting to realise that I did nothing to deserve to be treated that way!,,
"[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] has extensive rape culture, It is truly the school i can pinpoint the most events onto . Two boys from there have sexually assaulted me, both entirely sober and not regretful at all. Both of these boys i already knew, one was my best friend. one of them boasted about it to his mates as if it was an achievement and the other i know to have assaulted several other girls. although i don’t go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] i’ve heard too many other disturbing stories about it. the fact that i don’t even go there and have been a victim of their pupils twice is shocking, i cant bring myself to imagine how some of the students who actually go there daily are treated. Myself nor others had received apologetic addresses from the boys, some no acknowledgement at all. One of them couldn’t even remember my friends name at a party despite assaulting her. I think it all circles back to the toxic masculinity atmosphere that thrives in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], where most of the boys have a dominance craving complex",,
"I was visiting a new friend's hometown at Christmas after my first term in uni. I got drunk and put myself to bed in the room I'd been allocated. Her brother came in lay down next to me, woke me up and just kept pestering me. ""Come on, just a wee kiss"". I ignored him for a long time but finally relented, basically because I was tired and drunk. His friend who was trying to sleep in the room just shouted, ""oh for f**is sake"" and left the room. His nickname was ""the rapist of Hackney"". Apparently this was his modus operandi. A few years later almost the same thing happened with him, I drunkenly fell asleep on a friends sofa when I was supposed to be sleeping in another friends house. He pestered me again, for what felt like ages. ""Come to my bed, it'll be comfier"" I relented and went with him again, I was tired and drunk. Thank god I was wearing tights because I could remember in the morning that nothing else had happened. I don't speak to those friends anymore, partly due to the fact that I was seen to have chosen him over them.",,
"I was subjected to years of unwanted sexual comments and unwanted touches. I was taught my body was a comodity in the playground and that i would only fit in if i was being sexual with boys. My first kiss was in the science corridor where i was pushed up against a wall and had a tongue shoved down my throat. Boys would often slide their hands up thighs in classes and i was cornered in corridors, to see if they could touch my boobs or butt. This was from year 7 til year 8. In year 9 we moved to the bigger school, where we were integrated in with different age groups. Year 11s would add girls they thoight were easy or 'sluts' and ask them to go nude on webcam. The worst experience i had, was a boy in my business lesson took out his penis, grabbed my handed and clamped it on his penis where he proceed to masturbate. He ejaculated all over my hand in a full class. I had to ask my teacher to be excused with sprem all over me and nothing was ever said. This never ending insaitable rape culture continued my entire school career. Leading to my rape. Which is jow i lost my virginity. I had left this school to attend a dofferent 6th form and met up with an old friend who still is an allumni of this school. He raped me in his own house, 3 streets away from my own and 3 streets away from school. We would walk home from over 7 years of secondary school. My friends saw this sexual encounter as problematic but i was so blind to the rape culture id been raised in that i took me til 2 years later and in therapy to realise that this is what happened. It is embedded and engrained into everything. No sexual joke was stopped, we were seperated into assemblies about periods and wet dreams and we had no other support. There was not respect for youbg girls growing up. Girls were pantsed in the school grounds, grabbed, groped. From the beginning of year 7. This was when we were 11 years old. My entire school memories are tainted with a horrid and dirty tinted glass. I didnt learn to respect me or my body as it wasnt mine til way after i left school and reclaimed it as my own.",,
I was walking home one day when a guy asked for directions which i gave and he went the other direction he soon ran up behind me and grabbed my ass and tried to grab my vagina too before i managed to get him off and he ran away.,,
I was raped in a bathroom,,
"I had been dating this lad for around 2 months, he didn’t go to my school but I saw him every other weekend, after a week of us being together he started asking me for nudes I kept saying no, he started to ask every night and whenever he knew I was on my own, I continued saying no, but one night he kept asking and asking saying nothing would happen if I did forcing me to do it, so I sent him a revealing photo of myself, I instantly regretted it straight after a few days after it had been taken we fell out and broke up he started sending the photo to people because he was annoyed at me, I didn’t know what I had done wrong, before I knew it the whole of my school had seen this image, it made me feel disgusted in myself, it made me stop going to school because I didn’t want to see anyone, in the end I moved school to have a fresh start where no one had seen this photo, still to this day I regret taking it and now know no matter how much someone begs or forces me to do something I can still say no and everyone had the right to say no there should not be/ is no reason to be pushed into something you don’t want to do",,
"I was in the local pub with my ex. When the boyfriend of my frenemy turned up - he seemed extremely distraught. My ex left and I had a drink with him. He went on and on about his girlfriend (my frenemy), I called a cab. I was leaving for the cab - when he followed me out and tried to convince me to go back to his. I so nearly got in that cab but his persistence paid off (I felt sorry for him🤢 and his tears - she had been mean to me too) After all that - when we got back to his place, he ignored me, then when I was just about to leave he invited me to go up the hill with him and partake in a bottle of whisky. Why didn’t I leave…. I was emotionally vulnerable and suffering from loneliness and low self esteem. Once we were up the hill we had a good time drinking whisky but he was just waiting for the right time to strike and strike he did. When I woke up in his bed the next day I didn’t remember any of it - in fact we, then, had consensual sex (because I fancied him🤮). It took about 6 years to recover from the shock I had suffered, enough, to finally process the fact that this (nice guy) parasite had raped me on that, very, first night. I wish I could say that I regret not getting in that cab but I can’t because I got pregnant and would never regret my lovely child - though I do regret my loss of innocence and by default- becoming a single Mum without any support and the further loss of my chance of creating a normal happy family dynamic with a loving guy.",,
"I was sexually assaulted when I was 13/14 in front of my whole class. The teacher pulled me and the boy to one side and told him off, but he did not face any serious consequences. The reason he did this was because it was a dare from other boys in the class. I ended up having many lessons with him until I left school. No support was provided for me.",,
"He was my boyfriend and I said no, he carried on. Rape by your boyfriend is still rape, no matter how guilty they may feel after, nothing is an excuse."",It didn’t matter that I was in an assault clinic, with evidence. I thought no one believed me and any asking me questions was all just a role playing procedure they did to pander to upset people.",,
"I was first sexually harassed in school when I was 12, and a boy in my RE class touched the breasts of every girl in the room as a dare, but the worst incident was in year 10, I was 15 and a boy rubbed his erection against my back in a DT lesson, the teacher said nothing, hardly any of my classmates even picked up on it. It was his last day of school so I felt like I had to put up with him, as if he had some right to my body. The school is very uneducated on sexual harassment, most of the time I didn’t realise it was happening until afterwards.",,
"i was at a boys house, just kissing, he started to move his hand down my trousers, i moved his hand away and shook my head hoping he would understand i didn't want that to happen. After this he tried again multiple times to put his hands down my pants, he also repeatedly tried to put my hand down his trousers to which i moved my hand away. I was about to leave and he tried it again, i had given in and just let it happen, in discomfort the whole time. i constantly thought it was my fault and he didn't sexually assault me but after time i realised after me saying no once that should be enough for someone to stop.",,
"i was talking to this guy from school for a while and at first i must have gotten the wrong impression, since he didnt want to put a label on it, which i completely understand and was fine with it. a couple months pass and he texts me saying he wants be more than friends, at first i was confused because he did tell me multiple times he didnt want a label. infact he wanted to be friends with benefits, obviously i didnt agree to this because it has its many downs to it. once i told him no and that we should just be friends, he started to act weird and dodgy. he would sit next to me in call and touch up my leg and we would walk in the corridors and he would go down my back",,
"I was a young girl , and i had the straightest grades i could . i tried so , so hard in everything . I had 2 best friends , and we were mischievous as anything but at times one of them would take it too far . he’d touch me , or grab me , and i’d make it clear i wasn’t interested . Then , one day in a music room at school , us 3 were messing about as we usually would , he asked the other friend to leave , and to lock the door once he was out . it was a common joke, for year 8 students to play the “lock them in see what happens” , it really was . but he then turned the lights off , and reminded me the room was soundproofed . i moved away from him and sat on a table in the corner , he pulled my toward him by my thighs . he pulled my shirt open , and started touching me . he ripped apart my tights , and undid my skirt , and kept reminding me that the rooms were soundproofed . he told me i should enjoy it , because he was my best friend and he was doing it because he loved me . and he carried on , and i kept screaming and kicking . the other friend then came back , and hearing me shouting from 1 room away , began to try to unlock the door . once he did , the boy in the room ran out , and i was left in my dishevelled uniform to walk in silence to the bathroom , and try to fix it myself .,I told the school almost a year later , they did nothing , as he was a “trouble child” regardless . he was already on a behaviour guidance plan , so they decided to just “put an emphasis on consent” in there . no punishment , no help for me , i even told the school councillor less than a month after it happened , and she said nothing.,""My best friend at the time felt me up when I was hugging him to say goodbye. I got off the train and he proceeded to spend the entire night trying to shame me into sending him nudes, referencing the fact that i had sent them before and asking me what was wrong with him that I wouldn’t send them to him. I felt guilty for saying no which I now understand is something that makes no sense at all. But I forgave him at the time because we were friends. He felt me up multiple times after that at parties and then decided to publicly humiliate me in front of our friends. I think he was embarrassed about what had happened and wanted to make me look bad so I felt like I couldn’t say anything. We stopped being close friends after that. I know he feels bad about what he did and we’ve talked about it since but I wanted to share the story because it became a formative memory of my school life.",,
"Throughout my 5 years at secondary school, i have always been sexualised. Boys commenting on my bum and some even going as far to grope me in the corridors. It was so humiliating. But it was even more humiliating when you hear people talking, saying i was asking for it. All because i crouched down to get something out of my locker.",,
"My ex boyfriend forced me to have sex with him and made me reenact the way I had sex for the last time with my partner before him, who I only left because he pressured me into it. I was crying the entire way through but he wouldn't stop. Afterwards, he told me I liked it.",,
"Lived with 5 boys in third year. As well as being extremely racist and homophobic, the way they spoke about women was disgusting. ‘Who could get with the ugliest girl’ was a game they liked and only spoke about women as objects. They loved doing it when I was in the room as they knew how upset it made me, and every time I called them out they made fun of me and accuse me of not taking a joke. I broke down at uni about it one day and my lecturer asked what was wrong. I told her and she said she wanted to take it to a disciplinary - to which I said no because I knew if they got kicked out they’d harass me forever. They found out I spoke to someone and instead thanking me for saving their education and attempting to behave better, they made my life a misery.",,
"I was sexually abused as a child from ages 6 to 8. Fortunately the perpetrator was brought to justice. However many friends of the family were not interested (didn’t want to get involved) as well as one entire side of my own family. Interestingly enough some people that did not offer support spoke openly about women’s rights etc but when an issue occurred they did not provide support.On reading some experiences of others aswell as Ronan Farrow’s catch and kill, Netflix Aussie and Daisy and although it was pictures I think Zara McDermott shows society just does not give women and girls support. this is an issue in society as a whole. The public just are not interested In supporting victims of this. I’d be interested to know if anyone has had the same experience. It’s like the saying for evil in the world to prevail it takes good people to do nothing.",,
A rumour went round about me doing sexual stuff to a guy and sending nudes.I didn’t.But no one believe me,,
in year 7 i went to a gymnastics competition with my school i was wearing gym shorts and as i got off the bus 3 boys who were much older cycled past and barked and shouted at me. the pe teacher was right behind me and she did nothing. i was 11,,
"Some older guys (16/17/18) came up to myself and my group of friends and were like ""wanna bang"" it was very uncomfortable. I was 13, one of my friends was still only 12.",,
"At my secondary school we had multiple PE teachers, the male teachers had an office in the corridor attached to the male changing rooms and the female teachers had one attached to the female changing rooms, but this could only be accessed either from outside or by walking through the female changing and shower rooms. One of our male teachers, every lesson without fail, would wait 5 minutes until all the girls were in getting changed, and proceed to knock on the changing room door before immediately proceeding to open it and walk through the changing area having a good oggle and saying he needed to speak to one of the female teachers. This happened at the beginning and end of lesson almost without fail. Even the boys were aware and called him a perv. They often tried to help keep him distracted while we changed, they would try and engage him in pointless conversations or with made up ""problems"" they needed his advice with to try and give is girls 5 mins to change without being interrupted by his intrusion. This often failed and he would leave the boys to talk to the other male teacher while he went to discuss ""important issues"" with the female teachers. After a year or so of this we started shouting at him as he entered the changing room, we had been telling the teachers from the start that he made us all uncomfortable but he was an ex coach for a professional rugby team and the school seemingly valued his place with them more than they valued the well being of their students. Eventually things came to a head when I snapped one day. By this point I had been exposed to multiple experiences of men taking advantage of their positions of power, and I told a few friends what I was going to do. They told me not to as they feared I would be severely punished, I explained that to punish me would be to admit their failure and I doubted they would do that. That afternoon we went to get changed and sure enough 5 mins later there was s knock followed by the door abruptly opening...I sprang into action and popped up over the wall by the door just as he walked through and dispensed a long spray of Lynx body spray straight into his face. He screamed and hollered and swore and lashed out. He said whoever ot was would be expelled, before I could answer one of the quietest girls shouted out ""only if they sack you first sir"" which started everyone else off, he was heckled and cursed and soon the headteacher came running having heard the commotion from her office across the entrance hall. He told her he had been assaulted, 60 girls countered that with sexual harassment. We were told to get changed and leave as it was home time. Next day he was still in school, nobody was taken and questioned about either the assault or harassment claims. Next PE lesson we were told ""last lessons events were never to be repeated and anyone who tried to cause the same problems would be sent to discuss their issues with the head teacher"". He never entered the changing rooms while our group were in them again, but I know he continued to for others, and the school never saw this as a problem.",,
"Long story short, I was drunk and my boyfriend at the time had sex with me after I had passed out and vomited at his house. I did not consent for it.",,
"I was in love with him at the time. It wasn’t even that bad and I hadn’t even realised that it could have been until a few months after. We had a fight and nearly broke up because he didn’t think I loved him enough, I was always elsewhere, I had other things in my life. I had a panic attack during the argument and after I had calmed down I just wanted to sleep. And he started to kiss me and I kissed back but he was forcing it and forcing it until I had to push him off. He said don’t do that, you make me feel rapey. He got upset. So I allowed him to do it. I laid there to make it up to him for hurting HIS ego. Because I owed him that, I owed him my body, this was something I had consented to right? No. I didn’t. But no one told me that at the time. You don’t know that when it’s 4 in the morning and he’s annoyed at you. You don’t want to cause more anger. So you accept that he can enter your body, and then it’s no longer about consent. Because CONSENT IS WHAT I WANT AND I DIDNT WANT HIM AND HE FORCED IT ANYWAY. He always used to bring up blue balls. How cruel I was for being so sexy. Grow up and have a fucking wank.",,
"I bent over in the playground once and a boy smacked my ass, I didn’t do anything about it because I didn’t know what was going on at the time.",,
"I’m year 9. Earlier on in the year i had a boy come up behind me and smack my arse in the corridor. recently i found out that that boy had been making comments about my underwear, this boy has always made comments about my body. He has been let off so many times for so many different things. It’s scary to think that we have to sit in a classroom with people that think this behaviour is appropriate",,
"I was groped by a close friend at 16 and then at 18, I lost my virginity when a different close friend raped me while I was drunk. The fact I know so many other girls who were in my year who experience similar things to me or worse breaks my heart. Women and girls need to be protected and schools need to start educating their students on consent and basic respect for each other. This shouldn't happen to a single person, yet every girl I know has a story like mine.",,
"During freshers, in my first university,I woke up to a flat mate on top of me, having sex with me. I assumed for a long time that I had somehow made myself appear awake to him and that therefore, it was my fault. I have never been able to tell anyone because my memory of it is so blurry as I’d been drinking and I’d made every effort to block it out as I was forced to see him every day for the next year since he was only three doors down from me in halls. The boys in the flat would mock me saying I’d been raped because he claimed we’d had sex far more times than I could remember - I will never know the extent of what happened. Eventually it was too unbearable and I moved universities. I struggle most with the fact that I was never able to tell him that I knew what he had done to me. I have no proof (besides the fact that I know he’s done similar things to other girls) and I struggle to even trust my own memory - he has entirely gotten away with it.",,
A boy that joined my school began talking to loads of girls on sc and I heard je was asking them for nudes and at the time I was so insecure and seeked and needed validation from boys. So when he asked me I gave in quickly and sent him pictures in underwear. I thought this would be a one time thing but when he kept coming back and asking almost every day I trapped like I owed it to him to send him pictures. He made me feel horrible and I would repeatedly say no but he’d tell me that it would be the last time and he needed to see me. This kept happneing until one day I’d been told he had sent some of my pictures to poeple at school I was horrified and embarrassed and I was so angry at him. I tried to get on with my life but soon after he asked me for money and he said if I didn’t he’d show my nudes to everyone and put it on his story. I didn’t give Him the money as the police got involved soon after. I came to learn that he’d done this to multiple girls at my school and his last as well as look at girls skirts.,,
"i was sexually assaulted at a very young age from 5-7.i was too young to know that this was wrong so i didn’t speak up about it till the age of 7. i have always felt as though what happened to me shouldn’t have been that traumatic because as far as my memory goes, it never got to the stage of rape, so i have always belittled the trauma that i experienced and i blamed myself. to this day i feel as though it was my fault that this happened for 2 years.",,
Boys were not at all told off for touching or talking about girls. Ive had people nip people inappropriately and when gone to the teachers they didnt care. Said deal with it basically.,,
I have a testimony because boys at my school touch me all the time in ways i don’t consented,,
In 8th grade my best guy friend or so I thought stuck his hand up my shirt and started to grab my breast. I tried to get up and walk away but he grabbed me and pulled my into his lap and stuck his hand down my pants. After everything that happened I went to the principles office and explained to them what happened. My guy best friend was very popular so he did not get in trouble for what he did. Many girls came out to me about how he did the same thing to them. To this day he walks around like nothing happened and continues to do this to other girls with no consequences,,
"i catch the bus to and from school, it’s a school bus so it’s meant to be safe but it’s just a breeding ground for bullying and more. there was one guy on there that got on my nerves and back then i was confident and outspoken so when he was being rude or mean i would call him out. he then decided to shift his attention to me leading to him getting his friends to ask me out, make gross comments about me and trip me over and i was fine with that it didn’t bother me to much but the tip of the iceberg was when he sat down next to me and made his usual comments met with no response then chose to put his hand on my thigh and make me really uncomfortable. i’ve tried convincing myself it didn’t happen and caught a different bus to escape the harassment but it still makes me flinch anytime a guy comes near me",,
"My ex she thought just because we were dating she could basically do anything. Whenever I said no she didnt listen, I usually ran to her bathroom or mine locked the door and stayed in there until I felt safe. She always made it be my fault and would always trigger my depression anxiety and e.d as a way of saying it was my fault.",,
"A boy who I had to sit next to would continuously touch my thighs and would put his hand on my vagina, I made it clear on countless occasions that I was uncomfortable with what he was doing but he never seemed to care.",,
"A boy texted me asking for nudes. I said no. He kept on asking after I said no, and then sent a nude himself. It was horrible. I kept saying no, and he made up some story about getting beat up if I didn’t. I blocked him but he managed to text me on another account. He sent multiple pictures when I had said so many times I don’t want them. Thankfully, he gave up. There’s been so many different occasions this has happened with loads of different people and it scares me how even when I say “No, I’m only 13” they still persist. People always make comments about my body just because it’s more than people my age have. I don’t even want to think about what it will be like when I’m older.",,
"I was very young maybe around 5 or 6 when i was at a garden party with tons of families. i spent most of it with an adult man my family did not personally know or by had met before - i don’t remember much, but he sat me on his lap and hugged me a lot (since i was so young i guess he kind of got away with passing it off as just looking after a kid). when we were about to leave he took me to a quiet area at the back of the garden and said he showed me a £1 coin and asked if i wanted it. obviously i said yes and he said i could have it if i gave him a kiss which i obviously did because i didn’t know any better then. my dad was furious when i retold the story excitedly but i don’t know if anything actually happened since i was too young to really register anything. it was only recently that i started thinking about it and feeling very uncomfortable.",,
This boy grabbed my ass. He was a couple years above. He did it twice and made really inappropriate jokes. I told the school. They didn’t really do anything apart from tell him to stay away from me,,
my body was rated if it would be fucked or not,,
"I went over to a friend’s house one night. I’d not been to his new house, but I’d stayed with him before. He was upset and drunk and alone, and I didn’t think anyone should be upset and drunk and alone, so I went over. We stayed up for a while, talking. He wasn’t completely wasted, but he was slurring his words. When I took him up to bed, he pulled me in with him. We’d shared a bed before so I didn’t really think anything of it. I took my jeans off to go to sleep - it was 3am and I was getting tired. This is where it starts to get blurry. He suddenly pulled me on top of him and started kissing me, messily, the kind of drunk kisses you only get when someone isn’t really focussed on you, they just wanted to kiss someone. The next thing I knew, I could feel he was trying to have sex with me. “Do you have a condom?” I asked. I wasn’t particularly interested in having sex with him, and since he was drunk he didn’t seem to be putting that much effort into actually doing it. He shook his head, and I told him I wasn’t going to have sex with him without a condom. “Would you have sex with me if I did have a condom?” He asked. I wasn’t sure, and I told him I didn’t know. He sighed, and then without warning, he thrust himself inside me. I froze. I couldn’t believe what was happening. My friend, who I had come round to look after, was now inside of me, even though I’d told him I didn’t want to. I didn’t move until he was finished. I’d love to say I fought back the second he came too close, but I did nothing. I couldn’t. I couldn’t make myself move. He didn’t come in me, he just seemed to get bored or tired and stopped. I lay down and still struggled with moving. I tried to move my arm, it was like a dead weight. I left the next morning, still frozen by fear. Every time he touched me I jumped out of my skin. He laughed. After a few days I told him I was angry with him. “Why?” I told him it was because I hadn’t wanted to have sex with him that night, and I’d told him that, but he’d ignored me. “Yeah no offence, that’s the least of my problems right now”. We didn’t speak again for over four years. The strange thing is, after that night, I seemed to block it out. I knew I had gone round, but I wasn’t able to let myself admit what had happened. At my doctor’s surgery, I once saw a sign for the sexual health clinic, with details on what it did. When I read ‘STIs’ I immediately felt hot and panicky. I couldn’t work out why. A tiny voice in my head said ‘he had sex without a condom, you’ve got an STI’. I couldn’t bear to remember that night, but it was still affecting my everyday life. I collapsed in the surgery after seeing that sign. It took two years worth of therapy before I could even acknowledge what had happened. Two years before I could bear to do an STI test because that would mean admitting it had happened. I was clear, luckily. He made me afraid of everything and everyone, but for two years I couldn’t even remember why I was suddenly so afraid. And do you know what? I missed my friend. I missed the friend he had been before that night. He sent me a message a few weeks ago, out of the blue. He said he wanted to check up on me as he was checking up on people during the pandemic. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I thought I’d blocked him on everything, but he still had my number. He didn’t mention that night, I don’t think he even remembers it. I’m still afraid. It still affects the way I go through life on a daily basis. Since remembering that night I started to shut all my friends out of my life. I stopped staying in touch with them. I was always terrified, because he’d been my friend and look what he’d done to me. I still keep people at arm’s length now, and I often feel like time has stopped since that night. It’s been years, and I’ve done so much in that time, but I can’t seem to realise it. Time no longer passes in my head. Sometimes I think about talking to him about that night and what he did. But I know he’d laugh it off, and in turn, laugh off the last four years of pain and fear I’ve gone through. I’m not sure I could bear that",,
"I was groped on a near daily basis when I was at school, years ago now! I don’t mean a pat on the bum either. Boys would really reach under and up and grab aggressively at your crotch. Stopped wearing school skirts pretty quickly. Wasn’t much better wearing trousers though. Teachers would just tut at the boys who all thought it was hilarious. I know most people would brush that kind of thing off as not serious, but I’m angry about it years later. It made me feel less powerful at the time, like I was just an object there for boys to use.",,
"I am 49 now but my first experience of sexual assault by my male peers is still a distressing memory. I was 10 and in primary school (I will not be naming the school as this is no longer relevant). I was the first girl in my year to develop breasts and as soon as that happened, the sexual innuendos and endless chest staring began from almost all my male classmates, I was not otherwise popular as I was a bullied child so had low status. One day the boys started a 'game' of chase. This involved around 20 boys chasing me round the playground, taunting me and half heartedly trying to catch me. Then one of them did catch me and bowled me over onto the grass. As I was laid face down, they all piled on top of me and reached underneath me to grab my breasts, roughly poking, pinching and punching them - I was left covered in bruises. However the scariest part was that I couldn't breathe, there were so many of them laid on me that I couldn't breathe and began to pass out. It was over quite quickly after that but it was not a teacher who stopped it and I didn't report it. I had already been a victim of CSA from a family member & repeated peer bullying so I had developed learned helplessness. No point telling anyone because nothing would be done anyway. I wonder if my subordinate status made it easier for them to do what they did, that there might have been some existing dehumanising factor. I was not a human to them that day, I was a piece of female meat to be fought over for their pleasure and not one of them ever said sorry.",,
I got in from a night out with my boyfriend (now ex) in first year. i was too tired (i wasn’t drunk or anything) to want to engage in sex. he really wanted to have sex so i clearly said “you can have sex with me if you want but i’m going to sleep”. i don’t know why i said it because i was already half asleep and just didn’t want the hassle of saying no to him because i knew it’d start something and i just wanted to make him happy. i remember just lying there while he had sex with me. technically i consented because i said yes but looking back at it he was having sex with an unconscious person and didn’t think anything of it.,,
"I remember an incident happening one summer at my Grammar School, probably in 1983 or 84. I would have been about thirteen or fourteen years old. There was a girl in my year group who had large breasts. One lunchtime she was set upon by a group of boys who managed to undo her bra and take it off. The boys spat in her bra so that she wouldn’t be able to put it back on again and so that her breasts would be visible through her school blouse for the rest of the day. I didn’t witness the attack myself but saw her shortly after with her arms over her chest, presumably the boys had let her go. A little while later that I found out exactly what had happened. The boys were exuberant about what they had done. I remember feeling angry and shocked but I did not tell my parents about what had happened, I think that I felt it was too shameful to talk about. I’m not sure if the group of boys who attacked her in this way were ever reprimanded for what they did.",,
"Within a week of starting university, the boys in my accommodation building had already established which of the girls they would sleep with and publicised this widely across the building group chat, at pre drinks etc. I was told that one boy in particular had named me and was reminded of this by other boys on every freshers night out. This same boy quickly established a reputation of ‘getting with drunk girls’ aka taking advantage of vulnerable women. This became a point of hilarity to most of the boys in the building as if this were some quirky personality trait or at the worst, a slightly pathetic last resort for him. On occasion some of them with more of a conscience stopped him from leering at drunk women or jokily warned them of his behaviour and ‘tendencies’. This was considered a normal and routine part of nights out.",,
My boyfriend when I was 14/15 used to try to finger me in my sleep in the middle of the night. tf,,
i was pressured into sending nudes and they got leaked,,
"When I was 13-16 years old, a boy I went to school with that I’d known from being about 6 touched me sexually in some way on an almost weekly basis. I never told anybody. The same guy begged me for nudes in year 11.",,
A boy that attended there forced me to do sexual things that I did not want to do. It got to the point that I would go to school in tears but tell everyone I had cramps or pain somewhere. I never wanted to go to school but I got up each morning and tried my best not to give up. Now I'm in a happy relationship with someone that treats me right and I could not be happier,,
"At the age of 12 my brother touched me a lot, i used to think it was normal. He had at that point orally raped me. when my sister finally spoke up about her being raped by him 3 times. When i had to talk to a social worker i had lied because i didn’t know what was happening and i wasn’t ready to tell my story. And now everyone calls me a liar",,
"I was with a few of my friends at a boy’s house. One of the boys started kissing my friend and wouldn’t let go of her, even though she was making it clear that she didn’t want to kiss him and was physically trying to get away. I managed to get him off her and then he grabbed onto me. As I tried to get away he started to beat me up. 2 of the other boys joined in.",,

"I attend [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] where, especially in my accommodation, there is a lot of alumni from the best known boarding schools in the country. These types of boys are often proper 'sports boys' that compete in the university sports teams like rugby and football. I was at a club that was very busy and full of students when a boy I had met at a previous flat party came and hugged me to say hi again which I politely returned and entered into conversation with him before returning back to my friends. However he kept finding me and coming over again and must have done around four times to keep speaking to me. I could tell he was drunker and kept grabbing me in a way that was getting more intense but I remained fine and was having a laugh with him. I turned around to see where my friends were and couldn't see them when he took my arm and told me to follow him, I said I'd lost my flatmates to which he pulled me harder in the direction he was walking towards some stairs in the corner of the club. I assumed that these stairs led to an upstairs room or bar so followed him only to find we were in an empty dancehall that obviously wasn't being used that particular night. I remember calling to him to ask what we were doing as he continued to pull me towards a store cupboard on the other side of the room and he replied 'wait'. Almost the minute that he closed the door he turned to face me and pushed me against the wall, kissing me and touching all my body. I was shocked but I managed to pull him away from me and tell him that we shouldn't be doing this because we will be caught. to which he said 'are you sure?' in a mocking way and started kissing and grabbing me harder on my boobs and in my underwear until I felt my bodysuit break. I was anxious that someone would come in and kept glancing at the door at which he pushed my shoulders down towards his trousers that he was undoing. I knew what he wanted me to do but I again said someone will catch us we should go. He instead held the door with his hand and pushed my head towards his dick. He continued to push my head while I was sucking him off to make sure I carried on and in the end I just gave in to get it over and done with. The minute he finished I ran back downstairs in an effort to find my friends and leave. While still looking for them I got eye contact with him across the room and he smiled and waved at me. This boy is Captain of the first year rugby team and is a popular, well known student who attended [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] which judging by other people I've met from this school seems to accept and encourage this laddish toxic idea of masculinity.",,
"I started going through puberty in junior school and was pretty well developed at 10/11. I had constant comments about my body from boys at school. It really embarrassed me and made me very body conscious. I would just laugh it off because I didn't know how else to handle it. Once I got to senior school these comments became ever more sexual. We had one PE teacher who would always make us jog on the spot to warm up, he would spend the whole time staring at my chest, I was so uncomfortable I eventually stopped going to his class. By the age of 13 I would desperately try anything to hide my breasts. I hated my body. A man once stopped in a car to ask directions, when I bent down to help he asked if I would get in the car to show him. It made me grow up very quickly and made me very paranoid for many years.",,

He got angry and started swearing at me until I retaliated. My hands were shaking, I was counting down the seconds until the bus would arrive. He pushed me several times and made multiple sexually suggestive comments. He tried to grope me but thankfully the bus arrived. I could put my earphones back in to block out the sound of him shouting at me on the bus. He thought I’d led him on. I was in jeans and a big coat, saying nothing except to defend myself from his violence.",,

"I went home with a guy from town. I knew some of his friends. We eventually started having sex and it was all fine, until he started choking me. I was asking him to stop and trying to get him off me but he was so strong. I was crying and attempting to make as much noise as I could. He didn't stop at all, if anything it made him want it more. Then I remember waking up, I must have passed out from it. It was terrifying. In the morning it was as if nothing had happened, like it was completely normal. I had a bruised neck for about a week and have only told one person this.",,

After having our lunch break I was going to class alone since my friends that I was with that day are from another class and the same guy that took me and smelled my hair came from behind me and grabbed my butt I wasn’t sure what I felt since his movement was so casual but later I heard him bragging about it and then more guys tried to grab my butt and some also took pictures and some of them even people I don’t know tried giving me random hugs.",,
"I was sexually harassed when working for the local authority .I took it to my female manager and she believed me. The process was shocking.

I experience his violence because of his jealousy., so his pride followed on at work . He intimated me began stalking me and my female manager.

"I had never given head before, but my boyfriend insisted that I give him and I even started crying in the middle of it because I was so uncomfortable but he was pushing my head down.

Upon reading Chanel’s page, I’ve learnt that unconsented oral sex is also classed as rape.",,
"I had a one night stand with a guy. In the morning he wanted to have sex again, I said no and was facing away from him.. he didn’t take no for an answer and did it anyway, I froze as it wasn’t the first time something like this has happened to me. When I confronted him he said I didn’t say no during it so it was fine (even though I said it before he did it) and he made me feel I was in the wrong and it was my fault",,
There was a girl who pulled me into an unused room at school and she pulled down my skirt and tights after about a few minutes of pushing her off I ran out to the bathrooms and put my clothes on before anyone could see me and a week later I found out someone told her I was lesbian so I think that's why she tried to force herself on me and try to rape me. She also threatened me at my bus stop saying if I told anyone she would make my life hell and I haven't told anyone about it. I also have almost all my classes with her. This happened on my first year of secondary I'm year 8 right now.,,
I was in year 10 and I was standing in the playground. One of the boys I was friendly with had dared his friend to grab my ass. He nudged by me to make out like it was an accident so I moved out of the way and he did it again. Everybody laughed it off and I felt I had no choice but to forgive him and talk to him normally.It felt like I was making a big deal out of nothing.,,
"He was a couple of years older and the idea of being with him was exciting. He took advantage of this and continually verbally abused me throughout our ‘relationship’, I was naïve and just accepted it. Coming to the end of our time together he sexually assaulted me twice. Both times were in his room with family downstairs. I was crying, telling him no and using all my strength to push him off me but it was hopeless. I’m scared to use the word rape because I came back to him after a few days (due to his manipulative tactics) but I think it was. A similar incident happened further down the line. I just wish that education on what is and isn’t okay was available to me because all of this could’ve been prevented.",,

Some boy slapped my butt without consent,,
Boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] have saved pictures i post and repost them in their group chats making crude and disgusting comments such as “i just nutted” or generally just sexualising me and my body. i have been repeatedly asked and pressured into sending nudes and also called a slut when i do not send those images. i also know that some hamptons have pictures of various girls from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and put them in a “wank bank”.,,
This incident happened when i was 23 and married by then. I'm a british born pakistani so had a pretty sheltered upbringing. I had a scarf on and a long coat and i was walking home with shopping on [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The older guy approached me - maybe 50? and said he was new in the country and needed to buy a phone calling card. I pointed out a shop to him and he said wait for me. To this day i dont know why i did - i thought he may need help with something else. After about 5 minutes waiting he said i want to buy you something for helping me - i refused and he insisted so i thought nothing off it and entered a corner shop. i pointed out to something near the counter and he said no come towards the back of the shop. My hands were both full with shopping bags at this point. Towards the back of the shop he started trying to kiss my cheeks. I thought it was weird but as i had an elder uncle do that before when we met infront of family i thought weird but ok. Then he started feeling my breasts and i was like no way. i got away from him and made him buy me some jam tarts of all things before we left. When we left he asked me when will we meet again. Thankfully he didnt follow me. When i told my husband he was livid at why i hadn't slapped the man and explained to me that he had essentially paid me with the jam tarts. I felt angry with myself afterwards and my stupidity.,,
"i have been groped many times in school, and have been pressured into sending nude photos and sent them unsolicited multiple times. i know my friends have experienced so much worse sexual violence. theres no outlet for anyone to go to, if anything, we are sexualised in school with our very strict uniform, and the ban of skirts. it makes me feel so uncomfortable that teachers overlook weird looks and comments, and dont have a place for students to go if they have experienced sexual harassment. more needs to be done and this school needs to stop sexualising us",,
One of the boys grabbed my arse in the hallway,,
In third grade a boy classmate squeezed my backside while I was bent over at the water fountain getting a drink. I received a week of suspension for hitting him in retaliation.,,
"I don’t remember having a drink. I remember poppers being chucked in the bonfire and the sweet sickly smell, then everything got a bit blurry, & a guy came over to me and offered to look after me. Huh. We made out then he took me to his van. I asked him to stop as he was hurting me, I started screaming in pain & he put his hand over my mouth. If you stop screaming it’ll be over quicker. I sobbed. I hurt so much. We went back to the fire where our other respective friends were. Had to get a lift back home with them - we didn’t speak the whole journey. I was cold - had to sit on a spare top as I was pouring with blood still. Mum was unamused when I got back to hers to learn that I had to go and procure the morning after pill. Nevermind me getting raped mum, yeah, I’m fine thanks",,
"When I was in year 12, it was insanely hot in my classroom so I took my jacket off and had a top one. The new male teacher who I begged since day 1 to be fired as he was constantly rude and not teaching the course, said to me you look like a ‘slob’ but was about to say ‘slut’. He later said you don’t want a teacher to come in and ‘think somethings going on’. I explained i was hot and he kept being rude to the point I literally had a panic attack and never went back to his class again. After I left he kept saying to my friends to side with him in regards to how I was dressed. Completely and utterly disgusting.",,
"During lockdown in 2020 I became friends with this guy from the boys school on instagram. I knew it was a real account because before covid I used to see him on my bus to school in the morning. When we started talking he was really nice to me and funny and we both got along with the topic of anime. On the first night we started talking he already told me he liked me but I didn't know what to say. Later on at May I ended up in a controlling relationship with this manipulative guy that I never wanted to be with in the first place. I would talk to guy I made friends with and tell him when I feel down and stuff sometimes. I finally broke up with the guy I was within September, properly. I say properly because it took over a month to try and end it. My online friend found out that I was now single. On September when we went back to school I would see [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] walking after school and I would text him that I did. He started waiting for me after school and would just walk with me to my bus stop. One time he then said that he wanted to hangout with me after school so I said sure. When we hung out he took me to the park near my school and I have never been there. He took me to the part that was just like woods and he took me where no would we actually be Abel to hear or see us. We just sat down on a log and he saw my arm was bleeding because I self harmed on that day. I told him all about my day and he gave me a side hug then started having a feel of my boobs. I was so confused with what was happening so I just changed how I sat which was just facing him then he pulled me in on to his lap. I tried to get up and he grabbed my waist and pushed me back down. He wanted to see everything and do more I didn't know what to say or do at this point and he started unbuttoning my shirt and unclipped my bra. He started having a feel and moving me back and forth until he came. I didn't know what to do moan from confusion?Shock?Because its what I'm ""meant"" to do? When he came he finally let me go and I put my shirt on properly and when I got up away from him he tried touching my boobs and down there..then kept kissing me on my neck to try and get me into the mood to do what he wants. I heard some familiar voices so I shouted their names and that it's me. They came and we left. He apparently told my ex that I allowed him to do touch me and told someone that I'm like a bitch or a slut. He didn't talk to me for a while until like a few months later and he kept apologising say he didn't realise what he did was bad and was asking to make it up to me. He said to meet him at the same place...and just me and him... he even asked if he should bring condoms this time... so I blocked him. I couldn't tell my friends or anyone I just played it off as nothing but I guess it was really hard I still think about it all the time.",,
"when I was 14, I was really drunk on party and throwing up everywhere one of my friends (who i’d previously got with) came to help me. He made me give him head until eventually I got him to stop, I only remember parts of that night, and never mentioned it to anyone as i felt it wasn’t assault cause he did eventually stop. He’s since asked for nudes on multiple occasions, and when i said no he responded with ‘that’s not a real reason though’. It’s so disgusting to me that I ever questioned my experience as i thought it wasn’t as bad as other stories I had heard.",,
"Agreed to give my boyfriend head. He was really rough and controlling. I vomited as he came down my throat, against my will. Felt horrible and ashamed. He didn’t care.",,
"i was 'fridgid' up until i got with several boys one night, out of pressure, and then i was 'easy' and 'slutty' and my male 'friends' decided this of me. i was groped at parties, after school and even during lessons under the tables. We called it 'touchy feely' but it was actually just boys assaulting us; touching, stroking and grabbing our bums, vaginas and breasts against our consent. Ive had male friends make up lies about me to fit the label of me being 'fridgid', simply because i didnt want to do anything sexual with them. Another put his fingers up my skirt and into my vagina whilst i was waiting at a bus stop. Another cornered me at a party and groped my breasts. The sexualised teasing was entirely nornalised and relentless",,
"this was the 9th time it had happened and was probably the most scarring for me, it was lunch and i was standing under the stairs with my best friend, his friend, and *him*, my best friend went to go get a drink from the canteen and i didnt want anything so i just stayed there with *him*, he looked around, and then pushed me up against the wall, hed always been a little odd but to be honest i didnt think he was like that, anyway, he held me up against the wall, keeping my arms down and touched me from the back to the front and then went up my body with his hand, i didnt know what to do so i just let it happen, he then said to me ""you tell anyone about this and ill kill you"" i dont think he was serious but the way he said it just gave me chills, i hope no one ever has to go through this.",,
"This happened back in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He started talking to me and asked me for my number even though I said I had a boyfriend. I felt too awkward to say no - I see him around all the time where I live. He sent me a shirtless picture on snapchat saying 'hey gorgeous'. When he found out that I'm in a polyamorous relationship, we started flirting. No-one talks about the fawn response and how common it is, especially in sexual abuse survivors like myself. My boyfriend and I said we'd like to have sex altogether in a hotel room (restrictions permitting) if we were going to do anything, and we arranged to go for a walk to negotiate things. I did suspect we'd end up having sex but it felt like more of a thing I had got myself in to rather than something I really wanted to do. On the walk, we got to a patch of woodland and the guy immediately grabbed my boobs and butt from behind and put my hand on his dick. I froze but my instinct is to smile and laugh in uncomfortable situations, so this probably egged him on. I felt like i couldnt get out of the situation so we proceeded to have sex. Multiple times I expressed discomfort through comments about being anxious about being seen, especially considering the lockdown restrictions. He assured me it was fine. When I once made him stop he seemed resentful and said 'I was enjoying that'. He barely even wanted to put a condom on. Afterwards he told me over messages that he'd been arrested on an apparently false rape allegation, and after some probing he admitted he was never interested in my boyfriend and only wanted him to come along to act as a witness just in case I accused him of anything. When I confronted him recently he acted like i was attacking him and kept saying that he had nothing to prove to me, that he didn't owe me anything. I am currently going through a different sexual assault case and all of this has massively exacerbated my feelings of anger towards men and left me feeling so much shame, doubt and self-disgust.",,
"I was assaulted by a fellow pupil when I was 15, legally the school should have contacted the police but they did nothing and I remained in the same class as them for 3 years despite being constantly told the school was doing “everything they could” to make me feel comfortable. It was left to me to contact individual teachers to change our classes so I wouldn’t have to literally sit next to them.,Also, a serial rapist in my year was well known among the head of year and the other teachers but instead of talking to him and his friends they instead discouraged the girls from going to parties with him. They said they could do nothing till someone came forward but never created an environment where the pupils could discuss safely. Multiple times they admitted he would go on to rape more girls the next weekend and prey on the most vulnerable ones but said they still refused to do anything.",,

I was drunk. I woke up to find someone having sex with me. (I still find it hard to say I was being raped) I screamed and he ran off. Turns out the night porter had let him in AND told him my room number...",,
"Our school arranges students into two year halves, k and w from 7-9, then x and y for GCSE. At the start of year 10, I was behind a girl in the lunch queue who had attended the same primary school I had attended year 6 of. I don't think I ever spoke to her in that (large) primary school but she recognised me and as we started talking (I was with a friend of hers) we discovered we were to be in some of the same classes this year (we'd been in separate yr halves earlier). She was very excited and hugged me very tightly, pressing her chest to mine. I stepped away and said I didn't feel comfortable with her suddenly being in my personal space. She apologised. The next time I saw her, I had to sit next to her and she leant over me several times to read my notes as she claimed she couldn't see the board. Each time she leant across me for longer and got closer until she brushed my breast with her hand, then realised what she'd done, kept her hand on my breast then put an arm around me and apologised for making me uncomfortable. I told her friend, who said that she was lesbian and sometimes did that. I told this girl I felt uncomfortable sitting next to her if she kept getting in my personal space but was reluctant to report her as I became more aware she sometimes had a hard time for her sexuality. Later on in the year, I told the friend of this girl I was bisexual in passing, and didn't realise she had overhead me. She hugged me tightly again and I felt uncomfortable as I assumed she thought I was interested in her. My friend and another friend fell out so we swapped seats meaning I didn't have to sit next to her again but I felt uncomfortable knowing she hugged, put an arm around and occasionally touched girls breasts', but because she's gay and later came out as trans (this year/ yr 11) people don't feel they can report it without seeming rude.",,
"I was at a small party. Others and myself were drunk. I was sitting with my ‘friend’ who i had made it clear i didn’t want to get with because when he asked me to i said no. This didn’t stop him from grabbing my boob and forcing himself on me, when i tried to leave he pulled me back into the sofa and continued climbing on me and touching me.",,

I went out with a man two years older than me when I was at art college. When we split up he encouraged his friends to grope me if I bumped into them while shopping. As he had been my first serious boyfriend I felt that I couldn't tell anybody and he knew that.,,
"We were working together for an organisation at our uni, and he was round at my house for a meeting. We had a few drinks and he was pressuring me into sex. I told him no and to stop repeatedly because we work together and I wasn’t into him but he didn’t listen. He was touching my body and put his hands down my pants despite me saying no multiple times. I tried asking him to leave so many times and he just wouldn’t. I was scared and didn’t want to make him angry because I didnt want him to rape me so I tried to be chill and brush it off. He was also my boss and I didn’t want to have to quit. I ended up leaving anyway because I couldn’t cope. He is the head of this organisation, with lots of other women working underneath him. I hope he doesn’t do this to the others too",,
In my year 9 English class we were doing the Tempest and discussing an attempt assault on one of the characters. A boy turned around and said to me ‘ I wonder how many times I could try to rape you’. I told him to stop talking like that because I did not like it and he said ‘you dont have to like it I would do it anyway.’ Then as we left he kept talking about my ass and nobody said or fid anything to stop it.,,
I got pressured into nudes by a group of boys. Then they called me all sorts of things.,,
"I was about 10 when me and my friend went into a charity shop and were looking around. We started laughing at some disney princess earmuffs and this old man who looked about 80 came over to us and joined in our laughing. I was scared but laughed with him and he asked if we could help him find some headphones. We said sure just so we could get away from him, but as I was walking away he slapped my bum and said “go on then”. I didn’t know what to do so I just bought what I was buying and left, and only really spoke about it ages after because I brushed it off as nothing.",,
When I was 15/16 I had an abusive boyfriend who told me I was useless and would get nowhere in life. He forced me to lose my virginity to him and then afterwards said I was a slut for doing it and that he’d lost all respect for me. He also forced me to do anal sex. He repeatedly emotionally and physically abused me.,,
"In Year 9, Secondary School, I was on my period and having cramps in class. Because I was holding my stomach, a boy came up to me and laughed and said “sexy hips”. He prodded and jabbed my sides with his fingers to make me flinch and worsen the pain. He was well known in the year group to prod girls’ stomachs and bodies, and was the class clown. Teachers never took notice unless he didn’t focus on his schoolwork specifically. They didn’t care that he was harassing girls, it was put down as part of his tomfoolery.",,
As a 14/15 year old boy I was groped in my crotch area by both female and male fellow students. I suspect this behaviour was learnt from their experiences. Boys can be victims of sexual violence too. And the abused can become the abuser just like those who are bullied csn become bullies,,
My ex boyfriend would get mad at me if i didnt want to have sex with him. he would go on to say i wouldnt love him and complain until i gave in.,,
"so many boys at my school will ask for nudes , and when u say no they will not drop it until you are pressured into it , they will ask for sex and when u say no it’s “ur a pussy” “aw come on don’t be like that” “i won’t tell anyone” “just do it” “why not” , like is “no” not enough for u , or do u need to make us feel like we are nothing but sex or anything other than a girl for ur enjoyment, it makes me sick that this is basically normal at my school , it’s the most unbearable feeling when u feel like you can’t say anything at all , it made me so uncomfortable when he wouldn’t just let it go , when i see his face it makes me sick , i can’t believe that this has happened so many times that when you talk about it with your friends they say “yeah he said that to me too” “***** did that as well” “i told him i didn’t want to” either it’s happened to so many and it’s 'normal' or it’s noticed and no one believes you , you just cant win",,
A boy locked me in the toilet at a party and forced his dick into my mouth. He held my head down and I was stuck between his weight and the door behind me. He ran off after boasting that I gave him head to anyone that would listen,,
i was touched inappropriately by another student (groped) without my consent in front of teachers and none of them said anything . i didn’t talk about it myself because i was embarrassed and thought it was normal,,
"Starting from when I was 13, the age i was allowed to leave the house on my own to go and meet friends or go to school, I’ve been getting beeped at by men in their cars or they’ll shout things out at me. It happens day and night. I’m now 17 and it becomes a regular thing as you get older which is why people have normalised it and feel like they shouldn’t talk about it because it happens to everyone. That’s not how it should be, because it still makes everyone feel uncomfortable. I should not feel scared walking home alone, I shouldn’t feel the need to check behind my shoulder when I’m listening to music in headphones and I certainly should not feel like I have to take a detour to my house because I feel like someone is following me and I don’t want them to know where I live. These things have got to stop, I want to be able to feel safe wherever I go. Be that at night or day time, I want to know that I am going to be okay.",,
"I was in a relationship when I was 18, despite having consensual sex on many occasions, I was raped twice by my then boyfriend.",,
Was drunk and didn’t wanna do anything but he forced himself on me and almost 3 years later I’m still afraid to walk down the school corridor without seeing him lol.,,
my teacher got jailed for sexually assaulting me and other girls,,
"many of my female classmates and i have been inappropriately touched by the same group of boys in lesson under the desks. i have repeatedly asked to moved seats but have been told no as there is no evidence that what these boys have been doing is actually taking place. after class some of the boys brag about it as if it’s some sort of achievement. in PE they would always comment on how mine and my friends bodies looked, when walking in the corridor my bra strap has been pulled multiple times. one teacher even witnessed this happening and said boys will be boys and that there’s nothing i can do but accept it. i hope one day these boys realise how disgustingly wrong there actions are and that my school will start punishing behaviour like this.",,
"It was freshman year of high school, and I was constantly sexualized by everyone because I was what people would consider thick, people would constantly slap my ass without my consent and laugh about it like it was some big joke, even though I looked extremely uncomfortable. I never said anything because I didn’t want to look sensitive. But what really bothered me that year was when I was in class and a guy in front of me asked me if I was a good dick sucker and asked if I could suck his dick, he also said if I did he wouldn’t tell anyone. I said no obviously but that went on to be something I just didn’t understand, why did everyone see me in a de humanizing way when I couldn’t control how I looked. I ended up moving schools and lied to my parents that I wanted to move because there weren’t enough sports programs there.",,
I am a survivor. When i was 6 or 7 I and lost something so innocent and so frail. I am now 14 and realise how much agony and denial i have been in. I do not want to share too much detail due to it being so sensitive.,,
"I was 8 years old and had just joined the school from living in a foreign country for a while. i didn’t have any specific friends. this boy kept following me and picking on me and it made me feel weird. i ignored him. one day he made me go behind an alcove with him. he touched me on my chest and down there and made me feel uncomfortacle, even though i told him to stop. i still see him at school as he’s still going to the same school to me and he always makes an effort to speak to me and embarrass me or something.",,
"I am a cis male. In year 8 during a school trip I was on the coach sat next to a girl in my year who I had been friends with. During the journey she sat closer to me and started touching my leg without consent. I didn’t really know what to do because I was a boy and she was a girl, society expects men to enjoy that sort of thing but I didn’t and felt very uncomfortable. I didn’t think about it until a couple of days later but it took a couple of years for me to actually realise that it wasn’t “okay”. I felt like it was my fault for a while because I didn’t actually say no, I didn’t do anything.",,
"When I was 7 I was raped in my own bathroom, the baby sitters boyfriend did it. I go to the HighSchool that he attended, his picture is on a poster at the front doors.",,
"I was only 15 when I invited round this boy I was seeing. I had participated in sexual activities with him that night and multiple nights prior however, this time he decided to take it one step further. After repeatedly begging me to have sex with him and me repeatedly responding no I came up with a compromise. I suggested he could just put the tip in once and to say the least he violated my compromise and went all the way. Luckily he only penetrated me once before I was able to put a stop to it and we carried on the evening as normal. I was left scared in my own bed, gripped in the hands of a dangerous stranger who was disguised as this boy I knew and liked. I was mortified and felt sick within myself but of course beyond the shame I felt towards myself, it felt even more shameful to call him out. So I never did. To this day he is still friends with my friends whilst I am left to rot in the pit of self hatred he left me in that night. Two years later I am still that vulnerable young girl inside, too afraid to speak up.",,
"I invited someone over who I’d met at a few parties and who seemed to be a nice enough person - he had an untarnished reputation despite having more questionable friends. When I asked him to leave, he pushed me into the headboard and the wall behind my bed and told me he wasn’t leaving until he came. My collarbone was bruised for days afterwards.",,
I was on [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in the summer and I was pretty drunk and I passed out and this guy just placed himself underneath me and started to kiss me. I played it off as if nothing happened but deep down I knew it was so wrong. He was a weirdly short boy so not my type at all and he used me when I had passed out drunk,,
Got my but slapped and kissed unconsented at school,,
"I was at a small party, a little bit tipsy, and this guy I barely knew kept taking me by his side and putting his hand down my trousers and along my waste. I tried to ignore it because I thought he would stop, but later on in the evening he kept telling me to sit on his lap where he then put his hand up my top, fiddled with my bra and felt my legs under my trousers and every time I grabbed his had to pull it away, he kept doing it. I felt really uncomfortable and scared and almost froze, not knowing what to do. I managed to quickly run to the bathroom, find my friend then immediately leave.",,
"I was at school, walking round in the yard at break time. A group of boys from my year approached me from behind. One of them walked backwards in front of me and began attempting to grope my breast and between my legs. The other boys laughed and encouraged him. I was really scared and felt so humiliated, especially since I knew all of the boys and some of them were in my form. I told my mum what had happened when I got home. She reported it to the school. The boy had apparently groped other girls too. He did not get suspended or punished in anyway. I had to continue attending classes with him. This happened to me over twenty years ago now and I still get scared when I see groups of boys or whenever someone walks behind me.",,
"I’ve been subject to male attention pretty much my whole life and from a very young age. I was considered a “pretty” child and even “prettier” teenager. I was raped violently coming back from a party, on the platform of a tube station. My friend at the time had left early without telling me. I was all the way in central London and couldn’t afford to get a cab back because I had spent the little money I had on the entry fee and this girl was supposed to be staying at my place for the night so we would have gone home together if she hadn’t had left early. I made it to the station nearest to my house and was the only other person in the carriage besides a man who looked around 10 years older than me (I was 17). He didn’t say a word the whole journey, only kept glancing in my direction and I pretended not to notice and kept listening to my music. As we got off the platform, he pushed me into one of the arch ways which was a blind spot for the security cameras. He had a knife which he threatened to use if I wasn’t quiet. When he was done, I was left bleeding on the platform. There were no security guards in the book because it was such an ungodly hour. When I got home, I showered 7 times. The damage was so bad that I took myself to the ER and got stitches. I told my best friend at the time (one who didn’t come with me to the party) and she was empathetic but had no idea how to help me. She reported it to the police behind my back and they came to my school to talk with me about it. I was so angry at the poor girl but looking back on it, I knew she was trying to do the right thing. (SL, if you’re reading this then I’m eternally grateful). I didn’t have any intention of reporting it when it happened but she kept telling me “what if he does it to someone else?”. At the time I didn’t care because the thought of going to trial or pursuing an arrest was too much to think about in my final year of a-levels and my mental health was already suffering. My headmistress/head of 6th form/head of boarding house/school counsellor/head of pastoral all knew and tried their best to help me with it but I wasn’t interested in the slightest. If something like this happens to you, a part of you gives up and for me, that part my fighting spirit. People who know me, know that I will fight about pretty much any injustice going on in the world, except when it comes to myself: when it came to that situation, I was a stoic. I told myself “shit happens” and that there was nothing I could do about it. I was so used to being objectified for my looks from such a young age that I figured it was just another nail in the coffin.",,
"I have written one of these before but here is my second one that happened at school. Myself and my group would sit on a bench on our yard he wasn’t really apart of our group but would come over to see me as I was his girlfriend. However when he would come over he would stand behind me whilst I was on the bench and pull my shoulders back which would also move my head back into where his penis would be. I would shrug his hands off as I knew where my head was and felt very very uncomfortable but every time I would do this he would pull me back into that area. And with my head in that area I could feel everything. Some of my friends would notice that I was uncomfortable and try to help but it was difficult as when I went tell him to stop he would act all sad and claim that he was just trying to hug me from behind. Prior to this before we used to sit on the bench he would put his arm around my waist, knowing that I didn’t like this. I would walk away and make excuses on why I had to move but a few times as I would go to walk away he would grab my waist tighter to the point where I wouldn’t be able to move away. My friends could see my discomfort and got me away. Its just hard that he did it so many times (what I’ve told in this testimony and my other one) and because of my naivety and fear I let it continue despite pushing away and saying no. The school still won’t move him out of my classes despite him being a tyrant towards me and making my life hell.",,
"I was touched all year by my male teacher and nobody believed me, not even the principal so I just refused to go back to his class and they wanted to suspend me but I made them put me into another class and even after that he still found a way to see me.",,
Alot of girls have been catcalled (including me) by several boys in out year and we have said plenty of times we are very uncomfortable with it and told the teachers and headteacher and they did nothing about it and gave us detentions for protesting.,,
"A few years back, I was blacked out and a boy had sex with me without a verbal consent from me. I had no recollection of what had happened until people told me I had sex with him. I was too blacked out and unable to speak to be able to consent. It was very traumatic. It’s been hard for me to talk to anyone about it, because I’m afraid no one will believe that this boy could do this. There’s a culture of boys doing and taking what they want , and it leaves those they do it to damaged in the process.",,
"As a 14 year old girl from an unhappy home, I was groomed online by an older man who I think was in Liverpool. At first he would offer to drive to check that I was okay, keep me company and it just escalated from that point.,It increasingly became more and more dangerous to the point he would drop me off at school. He sexually abused me over and over, telling me it was normal for 14 year old girls.,The school appeared to be aware because I was stupid enough to tell someone I thought I trusted, who then spread the rumour around school. The school did nothing. On one occasion they asked me to meet him outside of school - he posed as a family member. I eventually told my carer and they drove me to the police station. The police picked up my phone that the man repeatedly called - warned him and he never contacted me again. The police never interviewed me on my own or asked to speak to me / or my carer together. I was so scared and I was so ashamed at what had happened. I blamed myself for years.",,
a male in my class continually touched the top of my thigh after i asked him to stop. he moved right up to in between my legs,,
I was coerced by my ex into multiple sexual acts even after we’d broken up. I never wanted to but whenever I’d say no he’d beg me to the point where I eventually started just saying yes so I could get it over with and he’d leave me alone. The worst time was when he fingered me in a public place in front of our friends. I was so embarrassed and scared and I was just waiting tor the whole thing to be over. I sobbed after he was done in front of everyone and he still don’t realise/acknowledge that he did something wrong. Loads of people found out about it after and my friends used to make jokes about me for getting fingered in front of people. It made me feel awful but I’ve never told anyone the truth of what happened.,,
"In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] a guy that i knew tried to have sex with me even after I said no 2 times,he laid his hands on me with force trying to kiss me. That moment i said loud NO is No and hit him between his legs and give him a punch in his stomach. He got scared and ran away. We are not weak,we are strong even if we are girls. For those who don't know how to protect themselves, take a self defense course. I never took one,but I always know how to protect myself bcuz since childhood I protected myself, my brother and sisters from others who were bullies.",,
"In my maths and physics A-level classes, the boys in my group (in which I was the only girl) would casually talk about the girls they wanted to have sex with, breast sizes, their love of pornography and eventually, how to have sex with a girl against her will without it constituting “rape.” They freely spoke about their hard-core sex fantasies as if I wasn’t there. On one occasion, a boy excused himself, because he had to go to the bathroom to masturbate. At [X] casual sexism and sexual harassment is normalised.,I had many conversations with school staff, in which I told them that I did not feel comfortable in a class environment where my male group members were talking about bondage, ball gags and porn. I told them it was degrading and intimidating. My parent-teacher meetings were primarily used to discuss sexual harassment, instead of my education and performance. We were told “boys will be boys” and that it would eventually die down.,It got worse..My fear of being unsafe at school became a reality when a boy sexually assaulted me in a crowded hallway in between lessons by putting his hand between my legs and groping me. Other than reporting the incident to the police, [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] did nothing to support me. In fact, when I was told to recount the event and requesting that I be able to speak to a female staff member, I was denied this request. I was told I had to speak to the head and the deputy head - both of whom were males.,I felt violated and traumatised, both by the incident and also because [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] could have prevented the sexual assault by taking the concerns my parents and I had been raising for months seriously, instead of ignoring and trivialising them. When I began to struggle with sexual assault-related trauma and school-related anxiety, [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was more interested in my attendance than my well-being.",,
"I was raped by someone I went to school with, I trusted him and clearly shouldn’t have. I was forced into sex when I made it very clear that I didn’t want it. I had something very precious stolen from me that night and I’m constantly petrified around him and men in general. I now have issues with processing this trauma and can’t go to school for help because they will want to know who it was. Schools need to educate young boys, especially 16+ year olds on consent and how damaging sexual harassment/abuse can be. Not only do they fail to educate boys and girls on safe sex and consent, they only threaten girls by telling them to cover up/not send nudes etc.",,
"I was sexually assaulted in middle school by a friend of mine, the school did nothing, I told them the whole story and they did nothing.",,
"On my last day of year 10 there wasn’t many students in so classes had less people and different classes mixed, all day this one boy had been following me calling me names like “dirty slut” and kept taking my phone begging for my password, i told my teacher but she said “boys will be boys” and to “ignore him and get along with my day” so that’s what i tried to do,’but just before lunch he grabbed me and forced me to go with him into this empty classroom, he threw me up against the wall choking me trying to take off my skirt he was telling me how i was playing hard to get because i was begging him to get off of me, after a while of not being able to get away he frames down my skirt rubbing my private area, tears rolled down my face and he rubbed them away and told me i was going to be okay",,
"I was physically and sexually assaulted by a childhood friend when I was 17, we go to the same school now as well as having other ties through business and familial relationships. I didn’t say anything for months, I didn’t even really think of it as an assault until many months had passed as I had completely blocked the incident from my memory. I remember not being able to pee for a week due to the pain he had caused. After months had pass, a few girls at school went on to tell the school that they had been harassed by him, which gave me the confidence to come forward. My school told me I wouldn’t have to get my parents or police involved and I could remain anonymous and be in control of the situation. However in my next meeting the school told me I had to speak to a police officer, which I really didn’t want to do due to the mess it would cause my family. I didn’t press charges, as I never wanted to in the first place. The police ended up fucking up the situation and my school complained to the police leading to another drawn out investigation. I have now been told by the school that the boy will receive no punishment from the school and I will have to get used to seeing him in school in September as they believe “he has been punished enough already” although he has received no punishment what so ever…. It’s very common for my school to do this and change needs to happen.",,
"I’ve not even finished year 11, yet sexual harassment and assault seems inescapable. From the age of 13 I haven’t been able to feel safe leaving the house due to (some) men’s predatory behaviour. Even in school I feel unsafe and on edge. In year 7 I remember a boy groping me under the table and I had no idea what to do because I didn’t want to make a scene. I wish I could say this was the only time I’ve encountered sexual assault. Whenever I’ve tried to speak to friends or family they’ve always questioned what I was wearing or why I was walking alone. After Sarah Everard’s death, when people starting speaking up, I posted online my experiences with sexual assault and tried to spread awareness however the next day in school I was met with a boy in my class reading my story out loud fro everyone to hear, whilst him and his mates laughed at it. We need better education from a younger age on sexual assault because it’s young girls and boys who are facing the consequences of peoples ignorance.",,
"I was seeing this boy at uni who I met at a bar. One time I went to the his house and all of his flatmates were there. I was sat on the sofa and as a joke to see how ‘comfortable’ I was with him he proceeded to touch me infront of his friends. He ran his hand up my thigh and touched me, it was embarrassing. He would constantly ask for sex. I stopped seeing him and a few months later I was out clubbing and went back to a houseparty. He phoned me up, upset me whilst calling me a slut and ordered me to get into a taxi he had ordered. I was so drunk and didn’t want an argument so I did. I can’t remember any of the journey or most of the night after that apart from me telling him to get off and him forcefully having sex with me.",,
"There was one time when I and my cousin were strolling and walking at school together, just talking and minding our own business. This high school boy, whom we didn't know about but was from our school, stopped us and asked us to lift our skirts up. The boy wanted to check under our skirts for ""something"" and since he was older than us, and he was a student from our school, we thought nothing of it. I was uncomfortable with new people and we were about to ignore him if it weren't for his stubbornness. We wanted to get out of there so we just let him do what he wanted, thinking it was a safety check or maybe a pat-down. I could feel his stare under my skirt, I didn't know what my cousin felt but I was sure that at some point, they felt the same. We didn't even realize it was a wrong thing to do until a few years later when the subject of the boy was brought to the teachers. Only then had I realized was it very wrong and disgusting. The man checked our panties, and if we weren't at a public place back then, I could've sworn we would have almost gotten raped and would have lost our innocence. Today, I was thankful the worst hadn't happened. We were both in fourth, maybe third grade (very young) back then. I wasn't sure if this was the cause of my trust issues or maybe the cause of my social anxiety, but either way, the man had finally left the school and left me and my cousin alone. I'm just glad no other students had felt the same way we did. Stay safe everyone.",,
"There are around four guys in our big friendship group that every single time they get drunk they grope all of their female ""friends"". Every single time. We all know it, and we are all grossed out by it, and we try to push them off and yet they persist. I think people have had conversations with them but they carry on to be absolute creeps, and the excuse is that they're drunk. The worst bit is that I feel guilty if I get angry at them, like I can't take a joke or something, or like I'm too much of an 'angry feminist', when in reality I should feel free to scream at the man who is groping me when I didn't want to be touched. It makes me feel so helpless and violated every single time I go out.",,
"In my year group chat at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] a small group of boys would consistently post inappropriate messages including photos of girls photoshopped onto pigs, a zoomed in video laughing at a girls boobs, misogynistic memes, photos of their mates getting with girls at clubs and would actively bully people who tried to speak against it. After a series of allegations in another group chat they all deleted these messages from months ago. They knew it was wrong, but still went ahead with it.",,
"When I was 15 I had sex with a boy from 2 years above and when I came into school on the following Monday, I was given a standing ovation by everyone in that year and the year above when I walked into the cafeteria. They heckled me to come sit with them, posted horrific things on my social media including on my birthday which ruined my day, continued to shout ‘slut’ and ‘fat whore’ at me when I would walk by the windows of the sixth form common room or was just sitting with my friends in the piaza. For this reason I still to this day have the level of social anxiety I have now of walking into a room with a large group of people. I also confronted them to tell them to leave me alone and stop making up rumours about me and their defence was ‘I’m sorry you’re just an easy target’",,
"When I was in year 8 (13) a sixth former (18) started snapchatting me, calling me cute, telling me that he bets I was “developed” for my age etc. He asked for pictures to prove that I had breasts aged 13? I blocked him quite quickly after that but after telling my male friends about it it quickly became a big joke and lots of people knew and thought it was funny. There wasn’t a second thought about how I might feel being targeted by an adult who went to the same school as me. I think eventually after he did it to some other girls as well he got called into someone’s office (I’ve kind of blocked it out of my mind) but nothing bad happened. Nothing bad ever used to happen when they got caught. The school was totally complicit.",,
"I remember being baffled in year 7 by the constant barrage of sexual jokes and comments being to made. It made me be continuously on edge, always trying to second guess where the joke was, what punchline the guys were waiting for when they asked me an inappropriate question. Usually there was no right answer. This made me increasingly closed off talking to guys. It stayed with me right the way to uni. Boys often asked out girls ‘as a joke’, both online and in person. This was incredibly hurtful and damaging, as it embedded an idea that we were so unlovable that it was a joke to even consider us. As young women these judgements get embedded into our sense of worth and hinder us in future relationships, leaving us ripe to be exploited.",,
"When I was 15 I went to a party and I drank too much causing me to pass in and out of consciousness. A boy offered to help me and when I passed out his friends undressed me and took videos. He tried to finger me but later claimed that he was also drunk and didn’t know what he was doing. All his friends posted and sent around the videos (when they were sober the next morning so they were not able to blame this on ‘being drunk’). My friends insisted it wasn’t a big deal and that I should just get over it and it wasn’t important enough to be talked about. However, whenever I went anywhere with boys my age who I barely even knew they had seen those videos and made fun of me. Boys taunted me for months and some made group chats to harass me.",,
"A teacher sexually assaulted students for years. It was well known in the school, and even a joke to people. Eventually the issue went to the police and the teacher was arrested, but the school tried to cover it up and move on as soon as possible. They never tried to find out how many victims there were. This teacher came into my room and touched me personally many times. No one ever even asked.",,
I was in year 7 and a boy I sat next to put his leg on top of mine then told me my tights felt nice and put his leg at the very top of thigh and left it there until I asked to go to the toilet. I didn’t report him because I didn’t know what to do.,,
When I was fourteen I was bumping a lesson because I was massively anxious at the time and didn’t want to force myself to do this specific lesson so I sat underneath this staircase in a secluded area of a my school which was commonly used for bunking. This boy I knew and was friendly with sat next to me and I asked him to leave and find somewhere else because I wanted to be alone. He refused to leave and said he’d only leave if he could touch under my skirt. I refused many times but he touched me anyway and wouldn’t stop. I didn’t know what to do so I just froze until he eventually left. I didn’t actually realise this was assault until a year later and when I told a trusted member because I’d heard this had happened to some other girls in younger years by the same boy she said she’d speak to him but as far as I know she didn’t and he still goes to this school and I can only assume he’s still doing things like this to girls.,,
"When I was 16 I had a few male friends over for a party. I'd know almost all of them since primary school so we were all really close. We all got really drunk but I was a lot drunker than anyone else. One of the lads took me to the back of a field to kiss me which I was good with, but then I started to become unconscious and couldn't talk or stand or move properly at all. He started to have sex with me after I collapsed on the ground. He removed my clothes and I didn't know what was going on because it was my first time being drunk and I couldn't do anything with my body and it was scary. I didn't want to say no to him because he can be a bit aggressive so I kept asking him to slow down and saying that I'm too drunk (whilst completely slurring my words). He didn't stop although I completely passed our for a while. When I came round my clothes were on the floor and he had gone. I got changed and went back to join everyone because it was my house so I couldn't leave. When I got back they all day round in a circle and congratulated him and he told them all what my body as like and how I was too 'tight and dry' - I was 16 and a virgin. They all laughed about for ages while I was sat right with them saying that I wouldn't remember the conversation because i was too drunk and couldn't even talk properly. In the morning they all continued to make comments and laugh about it for months. I never understood that it wasn't okay I just thought I was being oversensitive to their comments. I told my boyfriend about it 4 years later and he made me realise that it wasn't consensual sex. All the feelings suddenly came back and now I'm having to process it all over again. Those lads have no idea the impact that night had on me.",,
"(just for context, I'm a trans man but I wasn't out yet when this happened),When I was 16 I started dating this boy I met while on [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We got on really well, so I thought why not date him? We had been together for a month or so when I went on holiday. He would text me every day and pressure me into calling him ""hubby"" and he'd call me ""wifey"", which I found very disconcerting. He would also guilt me into telling him I loved him every day, even though it was far to early in the relationship for me to say something like that. Then it escalated to him asking me for nude pictures. I didn't want to do this, so I lied about having heat rash because I was afraid he would share the pictures around to other people. He kept messaging me over and over again, so eventually I took photos in my underwear for him. He then responded with sexual comments about what he was doing to himself and what he would do to me. I wasn't ready for sex at this time, and these messages were absolutely unwanted. He also sent me unsolicited dick pics.,A week or so later, things escalated even further. We went out on a date to the cinema and he groped me repeatedly in public on the way. When we were watching the film, he fingered me without my consent and forced me to jerk him off too.,I was out with my parents and their friends in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], and I also brought my boyfriend along. I wanted to stay and hang out in the pub, but he insisted we went home. So we got back home and he forced me to give him a blowjob, which I said no to, but he went ahead and did it anyway. Then he said ""I don't think I can hold myself back"" which still haunts me today, 5 years later. The only reason he stopped was because my parents called to say there were coming home soon. I couldn't get him out of the house fast enough.,I was seeing a councillor at school, but she was totally useless and basically told me to get over it when I told her about what happened.,I've been having nightmares about this for years, and it's part of the reason I have repressed my bisexuality for so long. And as an extra note, he was very transphobic which--again--was part of why I denied being trans.",,
"This has been my biggest secret for 8 years now.,When I was 14 years old me and my friends would hang out with a group which had a few individuals who were 18+. One night we decided to lie to our parents about where we were staying so we could go to one of the friends free house. That night we were encouraged to take drugs and drink alcohol all of which were provided to us by older men. I don't remember most of that night but what I do recall is particularly traumatic. I had sex with one of the 18 year olds in the same room as my friend and another boy. I remember sobbing for hours afterwards and them telling me to shut up. The next day I was told I had come onto this man whilst he was asleep without his consent. I believed this as my friend and the other boy who had been there verified it. For years I suffered with suicidal thoughts and self harm until the boy that was there admitted to me it had all be a lie and they had come up with the story through fear that I would go to the police the next day. I then had to process that I was not the assailant but the victim and that my friend, this boy and my rapist had come up with a lie to protect him. The real story was that this older man had given me drugs and alcohol and then had sex with me whilst I was black out then when I had started to cry they decided to blame me so I didn't report the assault. It has been 3 years since I found out the real story and I am still no where near close to processing what happened to me that night. I still catch myself feeling like I am the one to blame but I try to remember I was a drugged up child that was taken advantage of and then lied to by everyone around me.",,
In year 8 or 9 my form teacher had to make my class line up to get our skirts measured because apparently the male teachers at our school and the boys school across the drive would be distracted if our skirts were too short,,
"i met up with a boy who i had been talking to on snap for the first time we got to the park and lied down. i was facing away looking at something and when i turned around he had his dick out, i sat up and said what are you doing and he just said i’m in so much pain please please jus do something and i said no and he kept asking and asking, eventually he grabbed my head and opened my mouth with his hands and even tho i was pushing up he was too strong. he shoved it down my throat and held me there for a mintute or two without coming up while i tried to push off. eventually i got up and ran off. i found out after he told all his friends that we stopped talking because he fingered me and i bled but he never fingered me or anything like that.",,
"I was groped on a near daily basis when I was at school, years ago now! I don’t mean a pat on the bum either. Boys would really reach under and up and grab aggressively at your crotch. Stopped wearing school skirts pretty quickly. Wasn’t much better wearing trousers though. Teachers would just tut at the boys who all thought it was hilarious. I know most people would brush that kind of thing off as not serious, but I’m angry about it years later. It made me feel less powerful at the time, like I was just an object there for boys to use.",,
"I was befriended by a 16 year old when I was 13, he invited me round to watch films and pressured me into sex then proceeded to tell everyone at school the next day. I was known as a “slag” and “easy” until the day I left because of this while he was hailed as some kind of hero.",,
"This boy and I know each other due to our mutuals. my first sexual encounter happened when he asked me to come upstairs for a chat. He then put me against his wall and groped me trying to kiss me. I was 15 and very innocent at the time ( I hadn’t even kissed someone yet). He had always messaged me on and off to meet so I can give him head etc. I also got in a relationship which he knew about and he touched up my thigh and tried to kiss me. He then got triggered when I refused and he said he felt embarrassed that I rejected him. This made me uncomfortable even when talking about it to my boyfriend and friends. Throughout his months of messaging he was with this girl that he was constantly cheating on, he ended up cheating on her with me and many others. I wouldn’t be surprised if he did this to someone else. This boy does not go to this school anymore.",,
In the late seventies I was sexually abuse by someone who was older than me quite a few times. Still to this day I still find it really hard to trust anyone.,,
"I was manipulated and lied to by a boy so he could get me into his room, and then he got me high and proceeded to pressure me past every boundary I drew. He wouldn't let up until I said ok and violated me. He proceeded to tell all of his friends lies about me and try to get me to go to his house again the rest of the year until he left. I was 16, 5', and he was 18 and close to 6'. I am still working through the trauma in therapy years later.",,
we went to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and he was touchy all day halfway through the day I had to use the restroom….. i walked in and a few seconds later after i had gotten done and started washing my hands he walked in and slammed me into a stall. i fought and i fought but there was nothing i could do,,
"I was a virgin, an older student got me drunk and invited me to his flat where he pressured me repeatedly into sleeping with him. I was not in the state of mind to consent. The first thing I told him was that I didn't want to sleep with him but he didn't care and forced me to anyway. It's been a year now and I still get nightmares over it and I still haven't been able to go on dates or anything like that in fear of it happening again.",,
"A couple summers ago I was at a friends 21st. I was really drunk and ended up kissing someone I knew who then told me he couldn’t get home that night as all his trains were cancelled. My parents were away so I offered he and his friend the guest room but when we got back to mine the boy I kissed was in my room. Next thing I remember is he asks me if it’s ok to have sex, I was unsure so said ‘sure’ and then ‘yes’ as I felt awkward and didn’t know what was going on. After that I woke up at some point and he was on top of me. He asked if it was ok for him to continue as I began to fall asleep again. I fell asleep before I was able to respond. Next day all our friends found out and I’ve avoided everyone since as I’ve realised I wasn’t ok with what happened as I was too drunk to consent, I could barely form a real coherent sentence.",,
"Throughout my years at secondary school I’ve been up skirted too many times to count, been aggressively grabbed both chest and groin and my chest has been stared at and laughed at by boys when doing PE. I’ve had sanitary items stolen from my bag and used to mock me by a group of boys. I’ve been asked to send photos in my underwear to a boy who is part of a group that are known for this, when I said no I was called a lesbian and a ugly fat prick tease. It’s just treated as normal behaviour- banter.",,
"It's nowhere near as bad as many people's stories, for which I am grateful, but mine are just the regular sexist experiences most girls go through. Firstly, I kissed this guy at the end of a night out and the next day, he kissed me in front of a bunch of students, without my consent as though we were suddenly together just because of one drunken kiss the night before. I was quite awkward and people were giggling. I was quite insecure and ended up in a relationship with him where he became very jealous and possessive, called me a whore (which is the reverse of when everyone at school called me 'frigid' from the age of 14 because I didn't want to do more then kiss this guy I started 'going out with' on a school trip). My boyfriend threatened to kill himself and spread private conversations I had had with him if I split up with him and it made it very difficult to leave. After this I got into a relationship with someone who called me his 'no 1. whore' in front of his pals, cheated on me (he confessed afterwards) but continuously told me I was 'crazy' at the time if I tried to bring it up/leave and even tried to convince me that I had an alcohol problem (I have never been much of a drinker) rather than admit he was seeing other people.",,
"I didn’t really understand what sexual coercion was until everyone’s invited. Sexual assault and coercion has been part of my childhood from around 13. For example when I was 13/14 I was on holiday and I was kissing someone, even though I said I didn’t want to go further, as we were walking back from the beach he started fingering me violently even though I said no and was made to feel bad for saying no. Another time my mums friend felt me up in a public setting and then after apologising, did it again in my bedroom whilst I was alone and trying to sleep. I didn’t tell anyone because growing up I was constantly sexualised, expected to do sexual things and made to feel bad if I didn’t. I was constantly pressured to send nudes growing up. On one occasion when I was 15 I had been having consensual sex but really didn’t want to have sex again as I was in pain, I was given the option of performing oral sex or having sex again - he went on about it so much that I just gave in. I then wanted it to stop and was told to shut up. Unfortunately these are examples from people I know and was close to but there are also countless examples from strangers like random guys throwing change at my feet coming out of a pub talking about how much I’m worth, being touched up in the street late at night and not saying anything incase he hurt me, having my bum touched on the tube. I have had a boyfriend for a long time now. But recently I have realised that a lot of our sex life when we were younger was sexual coercion, me being made to feel bad if I wasn’t in the mood or didn’t want it and then wouldn’t speak or acknowledge me afterwards. When we broke up he manipulated me through sex as that’s the only time he would be nice to me/speak to me but then would go back to being mean and ignore me right after whatever we did. I don’t think people realise how big a deal sexual coercion is, and even if they are your boyfriend it still is sexual coercion and can have a massive effect on your mental health and how you view sex.",,
University is a breeding ground for rapists. In my first year of university I was raped twice by a man on my course who I thought was my friend. I told the police and the university after being admitted to a psychiatric ward where I was diagnosed with PTSD. The university did nothing and I was faced with disbelief when I told his friends and peers. This entire experience ruined my life.. I am only just beginning to heal parts of the trauma 3 years on. I wish I could name him.,,
"I had said no multiple times and tried crawling away from him, his friend just let it happen.",,
I got raped when I was seven years old until I was 10 years old it was a traumatic experience for me I’m now in year 8/grade 7 I think ? Every time I see a man walking behind I’m scared that it’s going to happen all over again,,
I went to a [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] party and I was alone while my friends went to the bathroom. A group of boys approached me and one slapped my ass and they all laughed about it. I didn’t tell my friends because I was too embarrassed but I feel completely fearful to this day.,,
"I was at a pub with my boyfriend at the time and his two friends. They were playing pool and a man came over, talking to everyone. He was old enough to be someone’s dad, I thought they knew him. He came over to talk to me and I didn’t want to be rude. We had a normal conversation and he asked me if they were all my best friends. I told him one was my boyfriend and he said he’d leave, since I had a boyfriend. He came over again, having had more to drink. I was looking over at the pool table hoping someone would notice how uncomfortable I was. The man pushed himself against by back and whispered in my ear saying “you’re the most attractive girl in this place”. I looked towards my boyfriend who wasn’t far away, I was sure he could see me. I realised that he wasn’t going to help me and told the man to fuck off as sternly as I could manage. He left and I ran over to the boys, told them what had happened, they made me feel like I was overreacting. The man came back, even more drunk and told me I wasn’t as important as I thought I was, his friends were trying to call him away from me. We left the pub. No one checked in with me to see if I was okay. I wasn’t. I wasn’t expecting him to fight anyone or save me but I’ve never really forgiven him for not acknowledging what happened to me that night. The same boyfriend would coerce me into having sex when I didn’t want to, it’s frustrating because I know that he sees himself as a really nice guy. He even told me after we had broken up that he found it unfair how well everything seemed to be going for me and how hard things were for him when I was the one who’d “fucked up” and “broken his heart”",,
"i just turned 14. i have been in a total of three relationships. 1) sexual manipulation 2) platonic and 3) stole my identity. 1 (who i will not name) took me into a cupboard at school and sexually assaulted me. the school knew but did nothing. this was at PRIMARY SCHOOL. it’s stuck with me my whole life and my family is still friends with his, infact, our siblings are dating.",,
"He was my friend. I said I just wanted to go on a walk but he said this will be more fun. I used to blame myself for letting it happen because I gave up, but in reality I just froze and didn’t know what to do. The other time, I was drunk on a night out and some guy was trying to go off with me. He said ‘let’s go on a walk’. I couldn’t even walk properly I was so drunk. He took me to a forest. I can’t remember most of it. I was blacking out. He made me go off with him a second time, this time he was really hurting me so I was screaming and crying, he thought it meant he was ‘doing well’. I also used to blame myself, since I was so drunk I went along with it. But I would not have done that if I was sober. I could barely walk and I was blacking out, he was fine. It’s not just this. It’s walking down the street and getting catcalled, approached by much older men. As a 16 year old girl it’s very uncomfortable and honestly scary. Getting my ass squeezed and whistled at while I was getting off a bus is not one of my top ten experiences.",,
I was sexual assaulted by my ex and my friend as well,,
"I don’t want to go into details because I’m still terrified of people trying to identify these stories. I was coerced by a guy and I felt so awful after, told a close guy friend after that I was in a bad place and was told “well you shouldn’t have picked him then” and “what did you expect.” I felt so guilty and like it completely was my fault for reacting like this when he was completely fine. One friend would moan that name (pretending to be me) to his friends behind my back and when I asked what this was he dismissed me. I had a something on my face and a rumour went around that it was an std from that one encounter and people, including girls who knew how I felt, were silent or laughed. I felt like people didn’t believe me as I had played it off at the time, when I was suffering in so much guilt, and this is why most people don’t know. Goes to show how much u don’t know goes on, and how there’s just as bad behaviour outside of these encounters, in the aftermath. There’s so much more to this story but the fact that the rumour mill is so bad at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is stopping me.",,
When I go to a state place I put on outfits to make me feel pretty last time I wore a skirt a 30 year old guy tried to look up it and there is also this guy there he always touches me he ether grabs my ass or my boobs and it makes me feel so uncomfortable but I can't tell him to stop,,
"I did a ski season during my gap year with [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Not only was I physically abused by the chef I worked with on a daily basis but one of the other chefs who I lived with took advantage of me sexually on multiple occasions. At the time I thought we had something and liked each other. But we never kissed once, he made me keep it all secret and he would just grab me and have sex with me whenever he wanted. He would sometimes corner me in the bathroom or in the store room and just turn me round, bend me over and often penetrate anally without consent. At the time I thought it was okay because I never said actively no but in hindsight I couldn’t have said no, and he wouldn’t have stopped even if I had. It was always on his terms. I later got fired because the management heard that I had had sex with a coworker. Both abusive chefs continued working for [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] even after I complained about behaviour. The guy I had sex with never spoke to me after I left.",,
"I was raped by my boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend). I was 14 years old at that time. The parents of grade 9 were planning for a field trip out of the capital for 2 days. They rented a very big homestay and there were many different rooms to choose. So I stayed in a room with my group of bestfriend. Things were going normal until the afternoon. All of my friends left the room and they said they will go somewhere. So I said ok and let them go. After like 15 minutes, I was wondering where are they and why they left for so long. I started to searching them in different rooms. And there was this room I went in that my boyfriend were playing in there (not his room). I opened the door and asked do you guys see my friend and they said no. Suddenly my boyfriend came out of the room, grab my hand and lead me to my room. He started to push me down onto my bed and got up on me. I was very terrified and scared that others would see me like that. So I pushed him out, closed all of the curtains and demanded him to stop. He then started pushing me onto the bed again and kissed me. He started grabbing and squishing my boob which I don’t want to. Then he pulled his penis out, agressively put it in my mouth for a blowjob. It was disgusting. After that he fingered me and do some oral sex shit. As a normal human being reaction, I moaned and he asked me is it good. I said no and trying to stop him but this mf didn’t stop. He continued and nearly put his penis into my vagina but I finallly stop him somehow. At that point, I was very angry and shock and traumatise at the same time. So I begged him to leave me alone. And thanks God he left. I was crying and thinking about it to this day. That was not the only time he sexually assulted me. He was fingering me in public where there is no people at all, grab my bum in the library, begging for my nudes, ask me to touch his penis, AND MANY MORE. The shocking part is he told his friend that I have sex and give him a blowjob in a voluntary way. I had told him to keep it in secret because it effects my life a lot but he didn’t respect me. I found out because I secretly log in to his instagram. His friends are now making jokes of me having sex and give blowjob. I am thinking about suicide because I can’t really take it anymore. Him and his friends are super toxic. One of his friend create a lowkey facebook account, asking me what happened in that day (the day i was raped). I clearly know that his friend thought I voluntary have sex with my bf but I explained that I was raped. He seems to believe me and promise he won’t tell anyone. Until 2 weeks later, his friend used his actual account to anounce everyone that the lowkey account of his is actually a fake one, it’s not his (but I god damn know it his and I even got evidence too) And it seems like that lowkey account of his, were logged in by many of my bf. I am very sad and disapointed. I can’t believe that they would do things like that. Very shocked. Toxic group of boys. And now a lot of people would think that I have sex with my ex lol. I think I’ll commit a suicide maybe??",,
i have been sexually assaulted while at college and out side college by people in my classes,,
"There’s this 11th grader on my bus, I never really liked him much. He’s loud, rude and really sexist. He keeps taking photos of me, I don’t know what he does with them but I don’t think I want to. If I make eye contact with him he’ll ask me questions, bad questions. When I leave the bus he calls out “Bye sweetheart!” and takes another photo. I think its an upskirt, but I never stick around to find out. When girls try to stick up to him, he pulls their hair and calls them sluts, skanks and bitches. At least I’m not the only one",,
i was sexually assaulted in the mill at my school,,
"I was sexually assaulted when I was 16. For a long time I tried to persuade myself that it ‘wasn’t a big deal’ or it ‘didn’t count’ as assault, because all the education we’d ever had emphasised that ‘no means no’, and even though I was drunk and I kept saying no at the beginning, I let him do it anyway. Since it happened to me he did it to someone else and I’ve never felt more guilty for staying quiet, but I was scared of being called a liar and a whore. I see him every day and that horrible feeling comes back every time.",,
My ex boyfriend pressured me into having sex with him and then criticised me after. He threatened to break up with me if I wouldn’t have sex with him and said that he wouldn’t be happy unless I sent him explicit pictures of myself. He said he wouldn’t love me if I didn’t do this for him and whenever I tried to argue he would call me frigid. He was my first everything and I loved him completely so I did everything that he asked of me. He repeatedly told me that because I was his girlfriend he could do whatever he wanted. At the time I didn’t think anything of it but when I look back it makes me cry. I know it isn’t nearly as bad as some of the other testimonies but hearing them inspired me to tell my story.,,
I was raped by an older man that I thought I could trust. He forced me to do things I will never forget.,,
"I remember walking down the street one day in broad day light and I clocked a very close presence, I turn to my right and a man was walking directly next to me. I tried to think nothing of it and checked my belongings and he sped up once he realised I’d clocked him, he then crossed over but continued to follow me from the other side. He then crossed BACK over to the same side as me and as I tried to cut him off at the corner of a shop, I turned my head and he was right behind me. I lept out of my skin and shouted ‘get away from me!’, thankfully the Sainsbury's security guard saw the whole thing from when he first started following me and stepped in to ask if I was ok and scared him off. He spat on the floor and walked swiftly away. I was so shook I started crying in the middle of the street.",,
"I was 9. in the comfort of my own home, my own room. it was my older brother, he destroyed me and my mental health. I was so innocent, so you and I had such a bright future ahead of me. I told my mum, she didn't believe me and he got away with the 4 years of abuse he put me through. I was trapped and silenced, too scared to speak out. the words he said stuck with me forever, he told me I was fat and ugly, I believed him. he told me i should kill myself and trust me I've tried so many times just to try and get away from him. his words and actions haven't left me. the things he said when I was nine, are still with me now, six years later. I'm scared hell do it to another innocent young girl and hell get away with it again. him ruining my life is bad enough, but I couldn't bare it if he ruin someone else, like he did to me. I can't go a day without feeling scared of what he could do to me, if he returned to his old, abusive ways. he completely changed my veiw on life, I'm scared of strangers, I'm scared of co-workers and I'm scared of my own family thanks to his selfish actions. he completely changed me and I'll never be the same again. and I hate him for what he did to me and I hope karma gets him soon.",,
"i've been asked to get into cars, followed, cat called, sexually assaulted, and whistled at in public areas and no one did anything. the first time i was sexually assaulted was 5. the most recent was the last time i left the house without my boyfriend.",,
i was pressured into sending nudes and they got leaked,,
"I was raped on new year’s eve of [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. i was 15. i thought i new what love is and thought i knew my boyfriend. who was 3 years older than me. he had snuck champagne from his mom’s cabinet and even though i should not have had anything i did. i thought that this was how sex was supposed to feel. i thought it was supposed to hurt and you were supposed to feel scared for the thrill of it. even when i said stop, he just kept going. i went home and for two years did not talk about loosing my virginity in a negative way. no one knew i was raped because the only way for me to deal with it was to talk about it being a positive experience. how was i so young and dumb?",,
I was walking through the halls and multiple boys were catcalling me and then one grabbed my ass,,
i got raped by a student,,
"At first it started with a single touch in a science lesson, to the point where I would get stalked walking through hallways, touched up as I went up stairs, This boy waiting outside my lessons waiting for me to come out so he can try get up my skirt again , I resulted in wearing trousers as I was told it was happening for my skirt was “rolled up”, it still continued. I had then reported it and the boy was let off for all the trauma he had caused me. The only thing left for me to do was wear a Veru large coat to try cover myself up even more so him and his friends wouldn’t touch me unconstitutionally everywhere I walked on school grounds.",,
"When I was 15, I was walking to the train station on my way to school. A boy I didn’t know, wearing a different school uniform started following me, asking me where I went to school, what year I was in etc. He told me I had something on my skirt which I thought was really weird and I sped up and told him I was running late he laughed and came up behind me and grabbed me and lifted up my skirt. I pushed him away and ran toward the station, he said he would get on the train and come to my school he kept laughing. The only thing that stopped him was that his Oyster card wasn’t topped up and he couldn’t get passed the barrier. The thing that threw me was that he just seemed to be doing it for fun like it was a game.",,
"After a sixth form end of year ball I got the organised bus back to my boyfriends house with him. We’d had an awful night, I’d found out he had cheated on me and he had then got in a fight with the boyfriend of the girl he had cheated with. I was very upset in his bedroom, got undressed to put pyjamas on whilst crying. Next minute he’s trying to have sex with me, saying that the night should be a special one for us. I remember lying there with him inside me crying so hard, my hands over my face. Until he pulled out and, disgusted with me, said he couldn’t have sex with me if I was crying.",,
"I was called out for my body I never liked it because people kept talking about it. Luckily I haven’t been a victim of rape. I had many people talk about my body inappropriately I never liked it and it made me uncomfortable, I have been threatened and they said that they would rape me. It’s still going on today and I get death threats. At first I thought they were joking, but now I see that they weren’t they were my friend but now no longer.",,
Me and a few of my friends all got sexually assaulted by one boy and we told the school and they did nothing because open of the teachers likes him and all of the male teachers think he doesn’t ever lie,,
i’m asked so many times for nudes. i say no because i feel ashamed when i do send them but i’m pressured and pressured by men to send them. it sucks. i just wish i was something better than my body,,

We kinda established it was gonna be a hook up and that we were both here for meaningless sex. We went out for drinks and we got drunk. He came back to mine and we had sex which was totally consensual. I thought it was all fine until a week later when he messaged me saying “we haven’t made a baby have we?” I had made sure for him to wear a condom the whole time. He then went on to tell me he had removed it half way through which I didn’t know about. He said he had asked me but even though I was drunk I remember the whole night. It made me feel super fucking shit and I still can’t bring myself to watch ‘I may destroy you’ cause it’s just a bit too close to home.",,
"I was with my ex, and I didn’t want to have sex because I wasn’t feeling up to it. He then tried persuading me into giving him head, again I denied He started getting angry and upset and said that I didn’t love him anymore because I wasn’t up for it, tried making me feel as bad as possible. Then I started to feel bad about it. Next thing I know we’re spooning and he slips his dick into me- I then consented as I felt bad through what he had said to me when I denied the first couple of times. This is sexual coercion and I didn’t realise this was so common until recently when it was posted everywhere on Instagram.",,
"i was sitting in english class in year 10 and sitting on the table in front of me was a girl i thought was my best friend. she dropped her pen under my table as an excuse to look under my skirt. i only knew until my friend sitting next to her told me, and added that she had done it to her too.",,
i have been cat called many times while attending this school. Many times i have been recorded without permission manly the recordings showing my butt. i have been asked for sexual favors and when i would say no they would keep on asking. i’m so sick of this school acting like there perfect there not.,,
"I was in the gym once just me, this guy and two other ppl on the team at school and we were messing around and then out of the blue he grabs my ass. I just found it crazy how a guy could do that considering he was rly nothing to me not even a friend (not that a friend doing it is ok), but we’re still both on the team today and he just acts like it’s never happened and he continues to push himself onto other girls consistently which is unbelievable considering he’s built this “rapey” reputation for himself which he knows about and doesn’t seem to give a care in the world",,
"I was out with my friends and we were having a great time walking along [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when we sat down and noticed a middle aged man wanking off while looking at us. We made eye contact with him while he continued, until we stood up and shouted at us and he ran away. We were fully clothed clothed and in uniform (not that that matters) and were obviously underage. We were all 15.",,
There has been many times where I have been too scared to attend my gym because it is on a busy road where catcalling often happens. A few times when I have been catcalled it has lead to me having panic attacks.,,
"I was 18, he was 36 someone I knew and worked with. He was married and had kids but took advantage of a paralytic naive teenage girl. Later I found out he had a criminal record with a history of physical assault",,
"I was raped in the street by a colleagues boyfriend. I didn't know what to do but was mostly panicking about what would happen to my job, to my colleague, would I have to go to court, would I get STIs and pregnant?! I was terrified of the aftermath. I didn't know where to go so went to hospital on my own because I didn't want to upset my family by telling them what happened. I was in a terrible state, covered in bruises, torn down below, and still in shock. I was asked to be tested for STIs and to get a morning after pill. The nurse, clearly annoyed to be dealing with me, just questioned me over and over again while writing up notes. I was in shock, crying and shaking. I said I didn't want to make a statement, I was terrified of it coming out at work and completely ashamed. I just wasn't ready for that, I needed help and reassurance. She shouted at me about why wouldn't I make a statement and told me it's my fault if it happens to someone else. I left feeling guilty, even more scared, alone, ashamed, and without any testing done and no morning after pill. No referrals for help, no kind words. I was just a problem. I haven't left my house since and relive it over and over again. What's the point reporting it when it will only destroy my life and it almost never results in conviction anyway?",,
"I had a nice weekend with my (at the time) boyfriend, we hadn’t been dating long either, but we were out camping with friends and the next morning we went back to his where after a couple hours i would go home. He wanted to have sex and there are some details i am leaving out which made the scenario fucked up, i was exhausted and said no but he was persistent and just kept asking and i had to keep saying no , i did like 11 times but it got to the point he made me feel pressured to do it so i did it loosing all respect for myself. Soon after he started to cheat ignore me and i ended it, there to find out he was bragging i was begging for it and i was a slag i am now hated by a lot of people thinking i’m a slag when i was in a position i felt stuck",,
"i was 13 ( i’m nearly 17 now)at a friends older brother’s party. I was drunk and passed out on the sofa. One of his mates came in and got partially undressed. He proceeded to get on top of me and that’s when i realised what was happening. i tried to get away but he pinned me down and put his hand over my mouth. I was a virgin and it was so painful and scary. i’ve never told anyone this apart from my now boyfriend and close friends. It’s completely fucked me up, i’ve got into physically and mentally abusive relationships because of it. i had no self worth and got used multiple times because i thought boys only wanted sex. after the break up with my last boyfriend ( who was abusive) i spiralled even further- developed anorexia/ bulimia and tried multiple times to commit suicide.,Thankfully i now have my amazing boyfriend who is incredible and has rebuilt my trust in guys. he treats me right and is so sweet. i’ve even stopped flinching every time someone moves suddenly or things like that. I’m still in a bad place but i’m better cos of him, i got help (still didn’t tell anyone about this though) and got the medication i needed.,thang boy ruined my perspective on life and my self worth and I hate him for that. i won’t let it stop me finding love. I used to not be able to have sex without being drunk because of him, but now my amazing boyfriend has helped me find myself again. he is the love of my life",,
i cant go to school feeling comfortable in an outfit because i am scared of others trying to use it as an excuse to look or touch me in ways i don’t want.,,
"He was my boyfriend. He kept asking and asking and asking until I said yes. It didn’t matter that I clearly didn’t want to. He told me “well it’s nearly the weekend and, you know, things could happen if you don’t with someone else...” I was 15 and stupid and in a bad place within myself, so instead of admitting to myself he was coercing me (which IS a form of sexual assault) I did it. It makes me feel sick to even think about it. I did tell my guy best friend at the time but he didn’t understand what was wrong. He asked and I said yes. It was all on me. Rape is awful and well known, but forms of sexual assault people forget about. If she says no, she means no. Don’t keep asking. If she offers, great. If you ask, great. If you keep asking after they say no, YOU ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTING THEM.",,
My ex boyfriend slammed me against the wall and put his hands around my neck,,
"When I was 17 I went to a pool party at my friends house with my (now ex) boyfriend and his friends to celebrate the end of year. When it got dark everyone went inside and my boyfriend and I decided to stay outside on one of the sun beds. We were talking and he decided put his hands down my pants. I told him I was uncomfortable and removed his hand. He didn’t listen to me and put his hands down there again. Around 4 or 5 times I told him no and removed his hand, I was scared because he was my boyfriend so I continued to try and joke with him etc while this was going on. He still didn’t listen. Eventually I just gave up and let him do it. I didn’t tell anyone and the school I was at made me believe that stuff like that wasn’t SA. It only just hit me (a year later) that I wasn’t being dramatic, I was uncomfortable and he didn’t listen. Even though he was my boyfriend, consent is still key. I’m still trying to get over what happened to this day.",,
"In first year of uni I had slept with a guy several times in the year above. One night, completely sober, I went round to his house instead. I ended up staying over. I woke up in the middle of the night with him on top of me trying to have sex with me. At the time I was too ashamed to tell anyone, as I thought it was my doing cause ‘what did I expect I fell asleep naked at his house’. Even to this day I’ve only told one person. I’m still trying to come to terms with what happened. Consent one time does not mean consent always...",,
"I was 16 years old, seeing an older boy from my class (he was 18 at the time), we were together for almost 2 years and he spent the entirety of that time pressuring me into sex, guilt tripping me and making me feel like it was my duty to satisfy him, I didn't realise how wrong it was until we finally broke up. I wish I had been educated on sexual coercion and the fact that rape is not just something that happens to you when you are walking through a dark alleyway, maybe it would have helped me get out of that situation. Now I continue to suffer the consequences of his actions.",,
I was raped in my first term in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] by a boy I trusted. It was the worst experience of my life. I am scared to speak out because he is powerful and the boys I and him are friends with will ignore it and back him up to keep the peace. I am completely broken by it and am transferring to a uni closer to home for my second year.,,
I was at a New Years party and this guy gw me whilst I was passed out and bragged about it to all his friends but I didn’t even remember it and only found out from my friends,,
Got touched inappropriately on the last day of school,,
"since year7 this one guy could never keep his hands off me and it got the point where he got his friends involved, this went on for 3 years before i told a teacher or a friend and even then the teachers wouldnt believe me and my friends still laugh at it to this day.",,
"I was friends with this guy and I would meet up with him of course, he’d come to my house now and then but one time he came to my house guilt tripped me into oral and sex whilst lying to me about being a virgin and then never spoke to me again until he heard I had gotten pregnant then miscarried and acted like it was my fault.",,
"I was walking down a busy road, having just finished my Saturday job at the leisure centre and on my way to meet my boyfriend at the cinema. A guy on his bike reached out and grabbed my boob as he rode past me and then laughed. If was 15 years ago but I still haven’t forgotten it.",,
I was pressured multiple times into sending nudes to the same boy i said no about six times but he kept asking. i thought i liked him but he pressured and made me feel dirty for not sending. i finally caved in and sent to him he then didn’t talk to me for around two or three months and then he texted me again and tried to pressure me into sending again by saying that i sent before it’s not any different from them i said no and he hasn’t spoken to me since. bare in mind at the time i was a minor and he wasn’t.,,
He refused to use a condom even though I gave it to him and wasn’t on the pill,,
"In school, me and many other girls were pressured to send nudes to guys. I have been sent so many nude pictures out of the blue and without my consent. When I was pressured to send nudes, they were leaked in the way which we now know as “revenge porn”. I was mocked & degraded. I was told multiple boys all over my school now had my nudes and continued to share them, I was 14. Years later, a guy (around 20 years of age) told me he had them still and printed out in his draw, in which I was in disgust as he was 20 and I was 14 at the time, making that very illegal. This was brushed off as normal.,I never told my truth to school, but many girls did. Victim blaming was exactly how the school “resolved it” where the young girl victims were sent to the police and so was the perpetrator. Both were kicked out of school temporarily and both were treated the same by the school. Not on. This is why no one else came out about nudes, because victims were blamed.",,
One of my best friends made me feel super uncomfortable while locked in his car. It’s so important that you realize the people who are closest to you are capable of it too. He’s never acted different with me after and I felt too uncomfortable to bring it up.,,
"when i was in primary , a boy would chase me around trying to kiss me after i constantly said no . he would make me lie down with him and watch the sky . he would also try to hold me hand after i told him i felt uncomfortable. he would call me his gfs name at the time which was also my best friend . know he is in my form and i have to sit near him",,
I was pressured into send nudes to a girl. When I did she the aired me. Then I found out from friends that she had contacted him trying to get him to tell everyone and spread around the school.,,
"I was walking down the high school hallway and these three popular guys walked up to me and they pushed me into the bathroom. I screamed but their hands covered my mouth, after 20 minutes I gave up and I let it happen. It was something out of a movie and I didn’t ever think it was going to happen to me. I went to the school and I told them what had happened but they didn’t believe me, they said they were just playing around.",,
I was wearing shorts in school and the guys were all looking at my butt and talking about it,,
when I was 15 I was at a meet with all my friends and boys from my school. We were all having a good time and just enjoying ourselves but drinking a bit too much. I felt faint so I went to the kitchen to get some water but didn’t notice this boy following me. I got a glass from the cupboard and when I turned around he was standing in front of me not saying anything and when I tried to get to the sink he wouldn’t let me past. He pressed up against me and tried to kiss me and tried to grab at me. I moved my head back and tried to remove his hands but he was persistent and just kept going. I was quite out of it but I managed to find the strength to smack him away and run to the main room. I could tell people were confused but I just sat there shaking. He then came back a few minutes later and sat down as if nothing had happened. I didn’t tell anyone becuase I was too embarrassed I had let myself become an opportunity for some hormonal boy.,,
"He tried to take advantage of me and take me home when I was under the influence under the guise of being a friend. When I refused, he treated me like something to be won and repeatedly harassed me. The school does not have a safe way to report these without me having to interact with him over and over again and I am terrified.",,
"Male teacher would take girls out of class and into his office to change if he deemed you had breached uniform regulations. He tried to make me strip down to my bra in front of him. When I refused he tried to unbutton my shirt and groped my breasts. I ran out to change elsewhere. I was so scared of him after that, and he did his best to make my life hell.",,
I have been sent multiple dick pics from multiple different boys from my school. The first one was sent to me in year 8,,
I was walking out of my science classroom and this boy in my class touched me inappropriately while i was in front of him.,,
It’s become normalised for nudes to be sent round. And of course it’s always “Yh but she shouldn’t have sent them” “if she didn’t want them spread she should have thought about that first”.,,
It was eighth grade year and a guy i had a crush on texted me on snapchat and we started talking. he manipulated me into sending him nudes of myself and he would inappropriately touch me and lied about ever doing any of it with me because he had a girlfriend at the time and lied for him. he told me how he was going to take my virginity away and would tell me how horny he was and would play the victim when i didn’t want to be freaky with him and i didn’t want to send him anything.,,
I remember being one to few black girls every time it was non-uniform day the boys would comment and sometimes (pretty often) touch my arse. It was in the days of leggings so I didn’t feel comfortable wearing them to school anymore,,
"boys at this school have a culture of slapping bums, puting their hands up girls skirts, thinking that joking about sexual violence such as rape is ok. This has been happening in this school for years. Teachers ether ignore, DSL are not approachable and girls just have to accept it. No one speaks up for fear of not being believed or harassed further by boys. When will this school educate their boys that this behaviour is not acceptable. This is widely prevalent and I'm surprised that this school is not on your list. It's shocking and parents at this school need to talk to their daughters and sons about what should be acceptable behaviour before something serious occurs if this wasn't serious enough!",,
When I was in my second year of high I was drunk from party I had went to and I started dancing on people and there was the football team in group and I was dancing with them and then these two guys from football team toke me to a room and they where drinking with me and I ended up on the bed past out I couldn’t remember anything but I remember them taking my bra and underwear off and they where kissing me with no consent and then they started fingering me hard and I didn’t like it I told them to stop and they didn’t listen then they put there thing inside me and it hurt and they where doing roughly and I said stop multiple times they just kept going faster and faster and I gave up at one point and it felt like I left my body like I wasn’t there and it so bad I feel so dirty tell this day,,
"This boy used to follow me around the halls all the time, calling me pretty trying to walk next to me, etc. He used to tell me anyone would be lucky to have me and i honestly just ignored him. At one point about two months before school ended, he got so mad at me because i was ignoring his comments and he grabbed my arm and dragged me down to one of the empty stairwells. One of the fucking security gaurds even saw him do this and they did,,, nothing. He was yelling at me, telling me that im just a worthless slut and that i wasnt worth his time anymore. He ended up feeling up my body and touching me in as many places as he could. I tried to tell someone but all i got was ""its too close to the end of the year for us to be able to do anything, sorry about that""",,
"My freshman year of high school, a guy was expelled for having a hitlist full of girls who had rejected him and their boyfriends. Before that, he had come to the pool with a few people from a shared activity. He routinely made gross comments towards my friends and I, ignoring us when we were uncomfortable. He made comments about how sexy we looked in our swimsuits even though most of us were uncomfortable and had deliberately covered up. He preyed after girls and abused them during relationships. I was 13 at the time. My friends were 15. He was probably 15-16. To this day, I don't know if he got any further punishment."" ,""A kid at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], not gonna name names but, he harassed me for two years straight. To the point that I would go out of my way to avoid him. He would constantly say things on the lines of guilt tripping and many other things. It didn't ever really get physical, but it still was a terrible experience.. He would follow me and many other things and everyone just wrote it off as ""Awe he likes you"". I even tried explaining that I wasn't interested in him but it didn't work.",,
"When I was 18, I worked in a cafe part-time. One day, out of nowhere, my manager, who I'd barely even met or spoken to, put his hands on my waist in order to get past. It's not that serious compared to other stories on here, but I remember feeling disgusted at being touched in an intimate place by someone who I barely knew, who had so much power over me. The level of entitlement so many men feel over our bodies is sickening.",,
Not a recent thing but got attacked in the stairwell by a member of a female gang who pushed her fingers in to my vagina while her sycophants laughed on. It was back in 1979 but I have never forgotten it. I was 13. Sexual behaviour dressed up as bullying and ignored by staff - whether it was through their fear or ignorance I don’t know.,,
when i was in kindergarten a fellow student would put in fingers on my vagina over and under my underwear during class as well as make me touch him over his pants. when i told the principal all that happened was he was suspended a couple of days. i still haven’t forgotten it and i’m 17.,,
"once i was walking to class and a boy grabbed my ass and my boobs and said it was a joke, i didn’t sleep that night",,
"I was 15 years old and he was my 16 year old boyfriend. He was emotional abusive and I often felt intimidated by him as he would shout and swear at me and often hit or throw objects when annoyed. One evening at his house he began to finger me and I just lay there afraid to say no. He then took my hand and put it on his penis as I previously was just lying there frozen. This continued and he lay on top about to penetrate me and I said no but he told me that i am just worried about what my friends would think. He took my virginity as I lay there feeling dead inside. After, I told him that I didn't want to do that again and he continued to emotionally abuse and manipulate me and therefore we continued to have sex in our relationship. I couldn't talk to anyone as he told me my friends would be annoyed and ashamed of me. The relationship only lasted 6 months which seems like nothing but at 15 years old and everything that happened, it has scarred me for life and it has affected all my relationships since. I've brought this to personal therapy but I still am working on the trauma I experienced.",,
When I was about 9-10 years old I got touched by older men in my private areas and even though i would tell them several times i wanted to get up and eventually even started crying they still wouldn't let me up until someone i knew came up with an excuse for them to stop. Ever since this happened i feel highly uncomfortable with people touching me or even coming near me.,,
"1) Went to a part outside of [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and got really drunk I blacked out. Woke up alone in a tent with a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] on top of me dry humping me. I have no idea what else happened before I woke up,2) Was on a night out and had been flirting with this boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He then asked to come back to my house, which I said no to. He claimed he couldn't afford a full uber home, so asked if he could get in my uber and then order his home from mine. I said ok because I felt awkward saying no. I thought he would order the uber from outside the house, but he insisted on coming inside (my family were asleep upstairs). We then sat on the sofa and he persisted for a whole HOUR (I kept checking the time), continuously asking me to have sex. I kept saying no, but he kept persisting for the ENTIRE HOUR. Eventually I gave in, I just lay there, and he left straight away, and I felt really disgusting. The next day I went into school and there was a new social media polling app that everyone from his school and my school in our year were accessing. The entire day (and subsequent few days) there were polls up about me being a slut, detailing what happened with that boy - he had obviously told everyone - blasted all over the internet for everyone to see. It was pretty much a public shaming, and I felt like everyone in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was laughing at me. I lost friends because of it, and never got to explain that i NEVER WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM and felt extremely coerced.",,
"I was talking to a boy for about 3-4 months when we became very close. We eventually became best friends and started doing everything together attached at the hip. One day he came to my house for dinner, we were sitting in my room just us 2 when he reached up my skirt. I told him to stop and I didn’t feel comfortable but he continued to do it. I told him to stop or we wouldn’t be friends anymore then he picked up his bag and left. I’ve been hearing rumours he spread recently that I was a slut and I sucked his dick while he was asleep which is simply not true and all my friends have left me because of this. I feel so alone and no one believes my story",,
I was in my first relationship when I was 15. We were just kissing this one time but then he pushed my hand down to feel his hard dick and then he started pushing my head down. He never asked me what I wanted. As soon as he finished he said he needed to go and he left me and I went home. I felt sick all evening it was the first time I had given head and I didn’t even want to it was disgusting I felt like a slut.,,
"I went out with some of my mates one night. A big group of us and other people from different schools were at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. After half an hour or so, i was drunk. And i was surrounded by some girls who i was told were [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. They were sexually harassing me by touching my private area and so on. They were acting like it was all jokes and funny.",,
"my first year of 6th form i fucked up for many reasons, but this guy was one. i thought he was cool cuz he read books, spoke like a southerner, chilled with weed n indie music etc.... but he was the most pornsick guy. harassed , pleaded with me to do some sick stuff for mere amateurs in the meat market of our times. he got a kick out of groping me in public places in college n college trips, got a kick out out of being mean to me. violated me, tbh. i missed a lot of classes, drank a lot. big up the philosophy tutor for letting me back into his class after me and that kid flunked the year. rape cultures everywhere not just north london chump colleges no doubt. in secondary school it was the staff you had to watch out for FFS. outed nonces in both schools in my postcode.",,
"Teachers would complain about the girls sportswear in the summer which consisted of lycra shorts, because they are ""too short"" and our legs will ""distract the boys"" yet the boys were allowed to wear their really short shorts all year round.",,
"When I attended the school, I was so excited because of the reputation of excellence it had. What happened though was years of bullying by the extremely clique driven students (and teachers). While there were many issues, the culture of kegging in the school is what got me the most. Popular girls and boys would pull down the skirts and trousers of less popular students, in the changing room or even in the playground. Teachers knew but there was no punishment. I got to a point where I had to always hold my skirt to make sure I wouldn't have my bottom half exposed. Everyone in my year had because of that seen me in my knickers, yet there was no consent to it. There's something really degrading and traumatising about having your body exposed to a room full of students, all laughing, and to be on the brink of tears without anywhere to go for help, knowing it'll happen again soon. I felt like my time at the school has left me with ptsd, simply because I wasn't the richest, smartest, or most popular; I was just a very average kid and that's a weakness there. And you can't talk to teachers, whenever I went to them about bullying, I was told to go away and I was making it up.",,
"When I was 15 I was woken by my boyfriend at the time having sexual intercourse with me without my consent. The impact of this event deeply effected me. I never went to my school for help but was lucky to have supportive family and friends as it took me a while to process what happened when I was 15 as sex was till very new to me and felt extremely isolated at the time. When I was in the last year sixth form, I wanted to do more to raise awareness on rape culture and issues surrounding it. I had loads of students annomasly write about their experiences with rape and sexual assault and harassment, this was then later put on display with other projects such as art pieces and essays to raise awareness. However after all of this. My school failed to truly acknowledge the statements of many students and further failed to change the teaching in the sexual education departments in addressing the issues of sexual assault, carrying on the tradition of sweeping rape culture under the rug.",,
"I was dating this boy around year 8/9 and one day we were kissing on my bed and then he started reaching up my shirt, at the time i wasn't wearing a bra because i wasn't that 'developed', i tokd him to stop but he keot going and i made him leave. I tried reporting it to the school but because it couldn't be proven it happened he didn't get punished.",,
"I had repeatedly told the guy I did not want to have sex as I was too tried (I wasn’t I just really did not want to). his response to this was “I just lie there and sleep and I’ll fuck you”, I was obviously then scared to fall asleep incase I woke up and he was having sex with me, so I decided to put a tampon in so he couldn’t. This did not stop him, he just proceeded as normal. He was a lot bigger than me so I couldn’t push him off so I lay there frozen unable to move with fear while he had sex with me. I had clearly not given consent, my body language also clearly reciprocated this. After about 10 mins he finally stopped as I was unresponsive and clearly distressed. I even blamed myself after for going even though he clearly sexually assaulted and raped me. I later found out he had done something similar to a lot of girls however I believe I am the only one he raped.",,
"When I was just 13, a school friend kept harassing me for explicit images. I sent them as I wanted validation. He showed them around to his friends. This was a big trigger for me developing anorexia, which has ruined my life.",,
"When I was 15 at a house party a boy and I were drinking. He was being generous with his vodka but I remember him holding the bottle up to my mouth encouraging me to drink a lot. I was having fun however I told him I had to find my friend as I had no other way of getting home. He told me he believed her to be at the near by park, we get there and it's absolutely empty and now I'm very drunk. We sit on a bench and we kiss which I felt comfortable with, until he asked for sex. I said no, he pressured me and continued. He forced himself upon me and I screamed and freaked out which must have frightened him. He left me sobbing, drunk and alone without my pants on in a park in the middle of the night. I was lucky a group of people that had also been at the party found me and I made it home safely.",,
A male at recess made me go to the bathroom and raped me,,

"First off, im a man. And a few years ago, about 5, I was groomed online. Im not going to go into detail, but people need to realise men go through these things too and everyone is open to being manipulated by people online and in person.

"When I was younger, around 12/13, I used to sleep at my friends house. She had a brother that I admittedly had a crush on. Every weekend for a few months, I would always somehow be left alone with him. At that point, he would start “tickling” me. But this soon became him throwing me around, me usually ending up on the floor with him on top, with his hands groping my boobs. I only told my best friend, but I took it all as a compliment and thought it was him showing that he liked me back. I have never mentioned it to him, and he is one of my best friends now. But I can never forget it.",,
"Once when I was on a work trip, we had a couple of drinks with the other companies that we worked with, later 2 of them stayed at our apartment to continue drinking. Instead of going back to their own apartment to sleep they asked if they could sleep at our place, and we didn’t think anything of it and just said yes. Then one of the guys (that had a pregnant girlfriend btw) asked if he could “just sleep” in my bed because it was so noisy in the other room, I said yes, but made it clear to him that it was ONLY going to be sleeping and nothing else. He started cuddling me from behind, and tried to put his hands down my shorts, but I told him no several times, and that I had a boyfriend. He was like ok, then stopped for a minute, but then started again. He tried to kiss me, and eventually he straddled me and told me to “just relax”. Fortunately I wasn’t that intoxicated so I told him to fuck off, and he literally told me that “you’re a good, loyal girl” just because I didn’t want to sleep with him....",,
"In June of 2018, I was smoking weed with an ex partner in the early hours of the morning. I was really messed up and despite me pushing him away, and saying no, he forced me down and raped me. I just remember dissociating from my body and praying it would be over soon. I was really high, and when he finished I couldn’t stand. I woke up several hours later, in the middle of the woods completely naked. I got dressed and ran home, but couldn’t tell anyone as I had snuck out. I had cuts and tears on the inside of my vagina from where he had been so rough. I managed to tell my parents 7 months later, and then the police, only for the police to tell me they couldn’t do anything. I tried to end my life several times, and my mental health was and still is in a state.",,
"The incident happened in 2015 when I was 15 years old. I remember as all the students in the class were waiting for the bell to ring to head over to our next classes, the assistant who was a woman came up to me and caressed my cheek without my consent. I was shocked because nobody has ever done that to me before. I did not want my first experience of my cheek being caressed to be done without my consent. I even asked her why did she do that to me. She never responded and just kept smiling at me in a weird way. No one else noticed because everyone was chatting away with each other. I believe that she took advantage because of the fact that she was a woman. As if it were a pass for her to do this when it’s still wrong. I never reported it to the school but I talked about it with my family.",,
many many people got raped on school premises as well as sexually assaulted at the back of the classrooms the school is aware of this and don't take action to maintain there good name I personally had to leave the school because even the teachers judged me and said it's above them I've experienced sexual assault multiple times when I first started there and it eventually led up to the point where I got raped on the premises not to mention the boys are still getting praised and roaming freely on the property,,
"I suppose this could have been partly my fault for failing to abide to the school dress code but I wore a black turtleneck to school one day (without wearing my school's shirt and tie because my shirt was too tight and I am heavy chested.) and I never realised it was slightly see thouugh. I had male peers and teachers stare at my chest ALL DAY then I got to my English class and it was only then I realised it was see through because some of my male peers in that class were talking about it right behind me and saying what they would ""do to me"" had they been given the chance, one even said ""I don't care if she wouldn't want it, I sure as hell do."" I went to my teacher and explained my predicament and he gave me a sweatshirt and a note to say that I could not take the sweatshirt off. I got to my final class of the day and my teacher forced me to take the sweatshirt off. When I did he got completely distracted because he then realised why I kept it on, he never let me put it back on, no matter how much I begged. He ended up making comments about me all throughout the lesson. The next day I went to my guidance counsellor about it and he blamed it on the fact I hadn't worn uniform rather than actually helping me. I was 14.",,
"I had been severely bereaved at the time and I was taken advantage of by multiple people. I reported it to 3 senior members of staff, two who were males and they did nothing but put my abusers in positions of authority and power. It’s has effected me massively. They were the start of my demise.",,
"At the age of 12, i was dragged into an alley by a man who tried to r@pe me, luckily someone's dog started baking nearby and he ran away so he wouldn't get caught. I was groped whilst riding my bike when i was 14 repeatedly by a guy who would follow me around on his bike. In December, a man followed me home with a knife the entire way from my house to my school. these experiences have traumatised me and have given me severe anxiety in public and a debilitating fear of the dark.",,

"I was never proud of the way we got together but I loved him severely, and I was young. We were almost about to celebrate our 1st anniversary, and it was an ongoing joke between us that we would send each other nudes(but we never did). I had taken some but never sent them because I did not want to. One night he asked and I said fine, only sent one. Then he asked again. I said no. He kept asking, over and over, no matter how much I said no, and the more I said no, he would act sad. So I felt bad and caved in and sent more. This went on for a few days and eventually accounts were made telling me how he was cheating on me, etc. It was a mess. We had just graduated with grade, and it was summer break. July 2020 to be exact. One day i had received a text from him saying he cheated on me multiple times and how he was sorry and wouldn't do it again. I told him no. That I was breaking up with him. He proceeded to blackmail me saying that if I did not stay with him he would expose me nudes. So I blocked him and quicky received a message saying that my nudes had been posted. I was humiliated. I didn't know what to do. His friend messaged me saying that the two of them were together and he left his phone at his house and he was hacked. I did not know who to believe ofc. On the account I was continuously bashed, and made fun of. Another girl was calling me ugly and my room disgusting. Then it was said I had went to the park and had a train ran on me and I had caught multiple stds. A fake account was made of me and then they made it seem like I was admitting it. I was continuously texting him on a new account he made while being in a group chat with friends gathering evidence. Soon after my nudes were paid to be put up on a porn website. I was and still am a minor. I didn't know what to do. Shortly after that, my very personal information was being handed out to grown, old, sick men, like it was candy. I was terrified, hurt, suicidal, and so disappointed. I received help from a very nice woman who said she reported it to the police, and so much more. I had a gut feeling he didn't do it, and I still don't think he did, but I have to heal, so to stay somewhat strong, I cannot speak to him. I told my mother and she said something would be done, but nothing happened. Nothing has happened. No Justice. No nothing. I miss him, but each day gets progressively worse. Every couple of months, a wannabe shade room account for meridian Ms will post my nudes and make me look like the bad guy.",,

"I was repeatedly sexually assaulted at this school by a fellow student, in the classroom during class time. Nobody noticed and I didn't know how to report it because I had only been taught what to do if an adult touched you without consent, not someone your own age.",,
"I attended this school for many years and left recently, the reason for which is partly due to these events. One weekend I was out with some girls from school and as usual, we walked up some fields and into a forest which was well out of the way from anywhere people could find. There we would meet many of the boys from our year. One weekend I got very drunk and one of the boys took me into the forest and despite my friend continually warning him not to do anything, he had sex with me. I remember him telling me to do things and I just lay on the floor waiting for him to stop. It hurt. After he was finished with me he left me lying, half naked on the forest floor too drunk to stand up. I think for a good part of the time I was not conscious. My friend realised I was missing, came to find me and helped me get dressed. Later on in the night when he was gone, one of the other boys came up to me and told me that the boy who had sex with me, told everyone quite proudly that he knew I was unconscious. I also remember the same girl who I was with that night told me not to tell anyone what he did to me because it could ruin his life. I felt so alone.",,

"[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is an awful school regarding rape culture. our schools are used to mixing with theirs as we are based in the same area and have the same names whilst also being single sex schools. i can name so many guys in year 11 who have done unacceptable things to girls in my year and the year below and it is inexcusable. My nudes i had sent my boyfriend after being pressured into a situation were shown around his friend group like a trophy. there are also 8 guys that i know of that have done sexual acts with my peers non consensually. it is not my place to drop names as the girls deserve control over what they do with their experiences, but it sickens me to my core.",,

I was once in a relationship with a boy who physically abused me and then sexually assaulted me. Although he apologised the next day he never learnt from his behaviour. My friends said they all hated him however fast forward a few months later and they loved him again. It’s like my story wasn’t worth me sharing. It’s made me feel small and tired of trying to seek for help.,,
"A boy I went to school with used to grope me everyday on the school bus and in our classes. Teachers watched and I would react when it happened. Eventually, I realised reacting doesn’t get you anywhere. I dated him because I thought he loved me but I found out he only wanted sex...I left him as I wasn’t ready. I’ve never told anyone how it made me feel, I don’t want people to think I’m attention seeking. My current boyfriend works with him now so I still see him quite often.",,

A boy from my school has spread word saying i have sent nudes to him. What really happened was he popped up the on of my snap stories which had a picture of me in shorts and he said “this could have been better is the shorts where tighter” she i sent him a picture with fighters shorts on. Because he has spread that some off the girls in my changing rooms ask me about it all the time. I am scared to be in the changing room alone with them just because he lied,,

"my school has really backwards attitudes towards sexual assault. skirt length is a huge problem. our skirts are tight pencil skirts with slits at the back, and we are expected to wear them down to the knee. however this means they are super uncomfortable so most girls roll or pull up the skirts to make life easier. but teachers are really strict and often girls are pulled to the side to be told off for their skirt length. on one occasion, our headteacher pulled a girl aside to tell her to pull her skirt down, and in doing so blamed the cases of sexual assault at our school on the length of some girls skirts. i feel this is victim blaming. not once have boys at our school been told NOT to look up girls skirts, that we are not an object there for them to look at, and that it is not okay to objectify us. and boys do. upskirting is also a huge problem. almost all of my friends have experienced attempts to take or even successful photographs taken up their skirts whilst waking up the stairs by boys. i feel that before the girls are reprimanded for trying to remain comfortable, the boys should be reprimanded for objectifying us.",,
"""On my 14th birthday I was sexually assaulted. My friend, who shared the same birthday, held a party. Two of his friends cornered me and simultaneously tried to unbutton my jeans and finger me - no one noticed. I struggled - they took hold of my arms and dragged me upstairs away from everyone else at the party. I clung onto the bannisters and shouted for help but no one heard me over the music. They fingered me and groped me and got a thrill out of the control they had over me as a team. ,""This was my first ever sexual experience.""",,
"I was 15 years old and had no previous sexual partners, no sexual experience and had only had my first kiss. I started dating a boy who was starting his GCSEs at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Very quickly things escalated and I was coerced and pressured into doing things I wasn’t at all ready for. He threatened to kill himself if I didn’t do these things or if I broke up with him. He kept asking me when I’d be happy to lose my virginity and I told him not for a long time so he insisted that instead we did anal sex to keep him happy. I remember laying on the bed moving away from him, ending up face down and being sodomised multiple times. 2 weeks later he had gotten bored of this and as I was leaving his house on [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] he forced me down onto the bed and said I should just “get it over with” so we could have sex in the future. He pushed his face onto mine to stop me from talking - like he was trying to kiss me but his mouth was just hanging open. He forced himself into me and I was sobbing underneath him; I didn’t fight because I couldn’t. I was pinned down and completely vulnerable. I opened my eyes and he was just staring blankly into me - almost as if he were looking through me and I wasn’t there. Afterwards he kissed me on the forehead and said “my brave girl”. After this event he raped me so many times - hundreds of times. I can’t even remember how much it happened. I remember waking up in the night and he was on top of me. Eventually he broke up with me after a 4 month long abusive relationship but the scars still remain to this day. He continued studying at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] for sixth form, I don’t know where he is now and honestly I don’t really want to know. When we were together he’d always tell me that he had rape “rumours” spread around school about him from a girl in the year below and a girl in the year above, he swore that if it happened again he would kill himself. I was silent for over a year until I left school myself in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity].

"When I was 15, I was making out with my boyfriend and things started to go further. He wanted me to give him a blowjob but I didn’t want to. He first made me feel guilty for not wanting to and eventually I gave in. After a while I realised how wronf that was and tried to stop. He then pushed my head down and forced me to. When he finished he asked me why I was crying, and didn’t understand why I would be upset. He told me that if I really hadn’t wanted to I would have fought back more. When I told my closest friend she told me it’s not a big deal because it’s not rape, and that no one would believe it was assault because we were dating at the time and I’d said yes on other occasions. Afterwards the boy was really nice to me and acted like nothing had happened. My friends dismissal and his ‘politeness’ fooled me into thinking I was the one being overdramatic and that I was in the wrong. It took me a long to admit to myself that it wasn’t okay what that boy did to me. Assault within relationships is so normalised it almost goes unnoticed.",,
"I used to work on the clubbing street in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] as a bar tender. It’s a close community of staff and everyone knows everyone. One year I had Boxing Day off, which is a big deal in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] as everyone goes out in fancy dress and it’s a very busy night. Because of its popularity taxis often charge double fare so when it was time to go home I was talking to one of the bouncers I knew complaining about the surcharge. He offered to give me a ride home because he lived that way and his shift was over. I knew and trusted him so I accepted, thinking I would be safer with someone I knew than in a taxi with a stranger. The whole way home he was telling me how sexy I looked in my costume and kept making sexual comments about me. We got a street away from my house and he said “fuck this” and made a U-turn in the middle of the road. I got scared and asked what he was doing he said he was taking me to his house, that I could spend the night there instead. I told him I didn’t want to and I wanted to go home but he was still driving towards his house, he pulled into an alley way behind his house and unbuckled his seatbelt and mine. He reached over me and reclined my seat back until I was lying down in his car and then he crawled on top of me and started grinding on me. He got angry when I didn’t reciprocate his movements so he shoved his hand up my skirt and under my underwear trying to “turn me on” but I was frozen and crying. When he realised I was crying he got angrier and got off me and asked me to come inside so he could “change my mind”. I told him I just wanted to go home, I opened the passenger door and started to get out when he grabbed me and pulled me back into the car. He drove me home at about 60mph, texting the whole time and didn’t say a word to me. Now every time I see him on the doors he teases me, he doesn’t let me into the clubs or he takes my ID off me and refuses to give it back. He told other bouncers that I slept with him that night, no one knows the real story.",,
"Sex education needs to change. When we started going to parties in year 10 (age 14/15) everyone would be very sexually ‘charged’ as soon as they got a bit tipsy. Girls would be falling in their heels and it seemed all the boys would just become predators thinking they’d get lucky (i.e their dick wet). There were two stories of girls in my year who were black out drunk and woke up to someone raping them, one of which was an older brother of the party host who knew better, of course nothing was done. I personally was locked in a bathroom and forced to give head to a boy in my year but no one believed me as he was ‘apparently too paralytic’ so of course it was my fault or I was lying. The slut shaming was insane - the boys would heckle girls as they walked past if it had come out they had done anything sexual over the weekend. I myself would get random messages calling me a slut on my blackberry. Countless times girls would ‘have sex’ blackout drunk and be slut shamed afterwards but not even remember anything about it and there was never any repercussions for the boys involved!! They would be called lads. I used to be so scared of sex that I would be shaking. I remember a boy once told everyone I was ‘shit in bed’ because of this and I just felt like ‘what is the point in me as a girl if I’m shit at sex’ rather than him recognising that I was in fact really uncomfortable. There needs to be more education around sex and consent and slut shaming because I still carry some of this shame and trauma almost 10 years later. We are not taught about female pleasure or how to say no or what the boundaries of consent are. I think the truth would make many of these boys from school uncomfortable with their past actions and what this means!",,

I had been seeing this guy for a while and it wasn’t anything serious. I went to his house like I usually would and we started having sex. He covered my face so I couldn’t properly breathe but eventually I managed to move my face to the side where his body was trapping my face. I was shocked that he did that and it always stuck with me. I just stayed there doing nothing I wanted to leave instantly but felt so uncomfortable to push him away. It felt so forceful and was something I was not ready for at all.,,

Two of these accounts were rape aged 15, then 16, and the others include being 'pussy grabbed' by one of my 'close friend's''. Another two were of a similar nature - waking up during the night, having been drunk and taking myself off to bed, with a friend lying on top of me trying to kiss me/have sex with me. And then sexual coercion for a year on and off by a narcissistic boyfriend. Stay safe, stay educated - read up on sexual coercion.",,
"I was eighteen, four months into my first year at college. My parents had warned me against being alone with a boy, but I’m asexual so I never worried about it, thinking it was some religious thing about consensual shenanigans. He texted at night, saying his depression was bad and wanting to come over. I said sure. We sat on the floor, and eventually he put his hands under my shirt. I tried to tell him to stop, but he told me it “wasn’t that bad.” The rest of the memory is disjointed, but I remember laying on my back, on the floor. My shirt is gone, he’s pinned my wrists above my head and is kissing me and grabbing and pinching my bare chest. I wanted to do something, anything, but I froze; just laid still and hoped it wouldn’t go further. He told our other friends it was consensual so he never believed me when I told them about it. I can still feel him on top of me when I lay down at night. I haven’t slept well in months.",,

In the second instance I had just thrown up from alcohol and put myself to bed, where I had been allocated to sleep by the host. I should note this was in the same room where everyone was sleeping. When the others went to bed he climbed in with me and proceeded to touch me up, try to finger me and try to make me give him a hj. This continued throughout the whole night with me constantly pushing him away from me, trying to block his hands and whispering no, out of embarrassment that others would hear, all while the room was spinning around me",,

He said terrible things about what he would do to me and how he would treat my body and if I said anything I would get hurt again, I brought a pocket knife for self defense and I told the counselor everything but I didn’t tell them I was on it the police were called and they didn’t do anything about it they checked the bathrooms and that was it because at the time kids used to have sex in there a lot, I feel like nothing was done and they never said if they caught the guy. I hurt myself at the time because i thought it was my fault how I dressed and how I acted I was ashamed, to this day I still am terrified of what he might do if he’s still out there god knows if he’s hurt other girls or people in general.",,
"I’d known the guy for years; since year 7 and this happened when we had left school. We returned for a mutual friends 21st birthday. We had the funniest night with friends and then a massive group of us went home to stay with a friend. We stayed up and had a cig and then went to bed. We agreed to share a bed (cus in our drunken state we forgot who was sleeping where). We went to bed. I woke up to his hand inside me. I was so drunk and so disorientated I just said no and he stopped, said “sorry” and then I blacked out. I woke in the morning and we’ve never spoken of it since. It still rocks me to this day, 7 years later.",,
"If ever we were lying in bed and I didn’t want to do anything, he’d lie on top of me so I couldn’t move. He’d laugh and whisper that it was “okay”. He’d then penetrate me whilst repeatedly saying “it’s okay, we’re not having sex, just don’t be boring”. He’d then push me down to give him head, then roll over and and not look at me once he finished.",,

I was 17. I kept ringing my mum over and over to get her to meet me from the bus stop, but she wasn’t answering. I thought surely he won’t actually get off and follow me? He did, and the only route to my house was down the side of a dark park, I started running, tears streaming down my face as he was gaining on me, but my mum had received my texts and I could see her running toward me. I shouted her and he quickly turned and ran the opposite way. I was terrified. ,Since then I’ve become all too familiar with checking for friendly faces and women on buses, as an escape route. I have had to do this a few times, pretend a stranger was my friend or associate and sit with them - even in broad daylight after an encounter at a busy city centre bus station. As I got off the bus the woman said to run until I got home - luckily he didn’t exit the bus fast enough before it set off again. ,I’ve been catcalled more than I can remember, and I’ve had boys force themselves on me in clubs, touching me and even ripping my tights or pulling my top down. My friends soon had a method of dealing with this, to deter unwanted attention and keep us all safe. ,I’ve been playing with a partner before and he held me down and said ‘I could rape you if I wanted too’, I was dumbfounded but laughed it off and thought nothing of it until his abuse became all too real a long 3 years after.""",,
I was 7 and we had a new babysitter and he had amazing reviews. He assaulted me on two occasions and would make me wear different outfits of characters from movies when it happened. I later found out I wasn’t the only victim,,
"When going to parties and drinking me and other girls would be constantly taken advantage by other boys, grabbing us, taking us to bathrooms, dark corners, it was terrifying, yet the next day the whole school would be slut shaming certain girls making them feel even more belittled and shamed, yet no one ever spoke about the boys actions",,
"I wanted to spend the night watching tv and drinking wine by myself, but my friend (35 yr old man) was pressuring me into letting him come over. Eventually I gave in, he came over and we ended up getting really drunk. When I woke up in the morning he was asleep in my bed and I had no pants on. I told him I wanted him to leave and he did. I saw him at work the next day and I told him I had no memory whatsoever of the night to which he said to me ‘don’t worry your not missing much, the sex wasn’t that good.’ I can’t explain how that made me feel. To this day I have no memory of that night and no memory whatsoever of doing anything sexual with this guy. I don’t know if he’s lying. I think about what he said all the time and it repels my whole body.",,
a group of boys touched me inappropriately and thought it was funny,,
"I’ve been sexually assaulted twice. Both by people I don’t know, against all odds. There’s no way for me to get justice. I have no proof. One held a kn*fe against my neck but it only bled a little so there’s no scar. I can’t walk down the shortcuts I took those days anymore without freezing up. I’m so scared. I’m not even in the age where the majority of these things happen. I’m so scared to turn 16. I don’t know if I can deal with it again.",,
"I was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions in school, from various boys in the years above me. The first instance I remember I was walking down a packed corridor in-between lessons, I was in year 8/9. This particular corridor would get so full in-between lessons that you couldn't really move, you just had to shuffle along with the crowd until you reached your lesson. I remember suddenly feeling a hand from behind reaching under my skirt, grabbing my bum and moving towards my vagina. I spun around to see who was doing it, it was a boy 2 years older than me who was smirking and laughing with one of his friends. I never told anybody until a couple of years later because I didn't realise it was a problem, I just knew it had made me feel embarrassed and angry. He was arrested the next year for violently raping women on the streets around our school at night. I didn't feel at the time that it was worth telling anybody, as I don't remember there being any conversation about sexual assault/ consent at my school. There were multiple other instances of different older boys getting me alone on stairwells after school, in corridors etc and proceeding to grab my boobs and bum without any consent or initiation from me. All of these instances of assault happened before I even had my first kiss, so I just had no idea that this was not normal. It is only now that I am older and have experienced clear cut experiences of rape and sexual assault that I realise that these experiences too were assault. There are and have been multiple instances which I have heard of from WHGS which display a shocking culture of rape and abuse.",,
"I got groped and violated by a fellow year member, a teacher watched and did nothing afterwards. The boy (completely unprovoked) grabbed my breast, felt for a split second and used it to push me away. Him and his friends continue to laugh about it whenever they see me as a taunt. One from that group use to harass me about my backside last year but thankfully he never did anything. This school has noticed girls getting harassed and touched inappropriately, and yet they have not punished anyone for those actions.",,
I was going out with a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who I wasn’t ready to sleep with. When he tried to initiate sex I told him to get off me and that I couldn’t take it. He didn’t stop and slapped me across the face because I was crying.,,
"At 14 I fell in with a bad crowd and began a relationship with an 18yo man. At the beginning we had a consensual sexual relationship but over time he became possessive and manipulative. He would pressure me into doing things I was uncomfortable with claiming that I was ‘his’. He started to become physically abusive and alienated me from friends. He would make me lie to my parents that I was staying at a friends house but really I was in his friends flats being peer pressured in to taking cocaine and drinking heavily. Later in the evening the abuse would happen, if I said no, he would hurt me, lock me in his house or threaten to kill himself. Sometimes I would pretend to be asleep and he would force himself on me while I lay motionless. At the time I didn’t understand it was rape, I didn’t believe you could be raped by a ‘boyfriend’. I fell pregnant while taking my GCSES, this was the wake up call I needed that if I didn’t make a change, this was to be my life. I terminated the pregnancy and told my parents some of what was happening. They supported me in getting away from him. Many people know he was physically abusive because they witnessed it. But to this is the first time I have ever articulated the sexual abuse that happened, because drugs were involved I didn’t think anyone would believe me.",,
"dated someone who repeatedly did not stop when i said no, said it was fine bc we were together",,
"I cannot say much without giving away my identity. I was raped by a university lecturer, he was inappropriate about students and told me he looked at ""hot"" female students social media profiles. He gave students drugs, would take drugs and pick them up on campus. I was in a very bad place and on more than one occasion I woke up having no idea what had happened the night before just Flash backs of him forcing himself into my body, my mouth and me asking him to stop. He was complicit in other incidents with other students and people he knew.",,
"When I was around 13/14 I had a boyfriend. We had been childhood friends for a while, so I trusted him... I had been in other relationships, but all I had done was kiss. Having bad anxiety and low self esteem, I wasn't willing to do anything other than hug and kiss other people. One day, my boyfriend and I went to the cinema with his aunty and his younger sister (she was 8). During the film, he kept trying to grope me and take my bra off. I repeatedly asked him to stop, but all he could say was 'What's the matter. Girls like this kind of stuff'. I couldn't believe that I had become a victim... I had PTSD for a couple years after this and I still have trust issues. I struggled to tell anyone, but I am glad that I can have a voice here",,
"I was in a mixed sex PE class, playing table tennis. I was focused on the game, and then I suddenly felt someone slapping my ass. It was loud, and it hurt and in no way consensual. I was incredibly embarrassed, especially as many other people were looking at me but nobody did anything. I began to defend myself to the person who slapped me and they acted as if it was no big deal at all. It happened in front of a few of my close friends too, who pretended it hadn’t happened.",,
"I was in the 9th grade. I really liked this boy, and he lead me on to believe he liked me as well. Then he started sending me nudes, and told me he wanted me to give him a blowjob in the woods near the school where we were going to meet. At the time I agreed to it, but he ended up dating this girl and we never met up. At school he would grab my thigh at random points. Moving onto 10th grade homecoming. I was a dumb teenager and had drank alcohol before the dance. This boy and I were talking since all my other friends were around. He ended up grinding up against me and I tensed up. He started rubbing me down there and biting my neck and I was extremely uncomfortable. Being sorta intoxicated I tried walking away but he grabbed me closer and kept going. I ended up walking away and avoided him. A few weeks later he sat next to me in the computer lab and grabbed my thigh once again out of nowhere. Thankfully due to the pandemic I never had to see him again.",,
"I was approached by a few men in my local park. They persistently asked me where I was going and where I lived. I was wearing a short dress, which at the time I blamed myself for the unwanted attention I was getting. I have now learnt that their behaviour had nothing to do with my outfit. The worst bit was when I saw a woman walking past. Initially she provided me with the hope that she may help me or at least make me feel more comfortable. She turned to me and told me “I was asking for it” by wearing something like “that”. Us as women are also responsible for the way we interact with each other and support one another. It is never a victims fault.",,
we used to go into [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] a lot in summer with our friends. it was fun we went a lot until one of our guy friends told us some of the boys were saying things like ‘might as well go again we get to see a bit of arse and tit’ or something along those lines. It made us all so uncomfortable and even tho it was fun we never went again.,,
"I was seeing this guy for a little bit and 2 months after, a boy I had never met told me he had been shown a video of me naked. turns out the guy I was seeing had taken videos of me half naked without my knowing or permission and had showed them to some of his mates. Worst thing is I called the police and got called crazy for it by some men in my life because this wasn’t seen as a ‘big deal’ and so many people dismissed the situation as a ‘misunderstanding’. Just goes to show how often this happens to people, girls in particular, with no consequence to the perpetrator because girls’ nudes being leaked or sent around is extremely normalised and common. girls are just pressured to accept what has happened to them and move on rather than hold the person accountable.",,
"When I was 15 I was raped while drunk at a party I had hosted at my house, by a sober boy from a different school to me, who hadn’t been invited. In the following months I was harassed by his friends in the street when I passed them (small town), called a slag/slut/easy etc, horrible comments shouted at me in public. It got so bad I was afraid to walk down the street. I never told anyone except close friends because I felt so ashamed and disgusted with myself for what happened.",,
"I never realised I was sexually assaulted and part of me still doesn't want to think I was because at the time he was my best friend and he made my life a lot better. We were extremely close and we both have quite flirty personalities leading people to believe we were together. it didn't help that we would make jokes about it and were constantly hugging and acting like a couple. I made it clear to my friends that we weren't dating but they way we acted around each other wasn't leading anyone to believe other wise. I remember one day we were at the pool and he wrapped his arms around my waist and just hugged me. there were definitely some looks, including ones from the teacher, but honestly it was funny to me and I was comfortable with it. I didn't say anything to him the first time he did it but he moved his hands down my back and grabbed my ass. because I stayed quiet it gave him the impression I liked it and he continued to do it at school when I wasn't paying attention. out of no where he would stick his hands up my skirt and make comments saying ""ik you like it"". I became awkward around him as I gradually started feeling more uncomfortable until I couldn't take it and politely told him to stop. he apologised for making me feel weird but then stopped speaking to me. I didn't say anything for a while and then kind of shrugged off the idea that it can be classified as assault. he is still popular and everyone would tell me it was just a joke and didn't count as we were such good friends.",,
"I have two teenage daughters at a mixed comprehensive in an affluent part of [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The way they are spoken to and treated at school by many of the boys, I would never be expected to put up with at my office. If any male were to speak to me the way they get spoken to, the male would get the sack immediately. And yet our young girls are putting up with far more than many women, in a place that they must attend, by law. For example, 'Your fanny smells like fish' was said by a boy in year 7 to his girl peers. The teachers took no notice and no action. This boy was eventually suspended half-way through year 8, after many such examples. The boys around him were influenced by this behaviour and it spread around, so that even when he left, this sort of verbal abuse continues. My girls would be too nervous and subdued to submit a response to this site, even anonymously - that is the effect that this behaviour has on them - making them scared even to express themselves anonymously. My younger girl says that the boys are actively anti-femist, calling her a 'feminazi' for speaking up for equal rights for females. She says that they all talk openly about watching porn, even in the classroom, with the effect of the girls constantly feeling objectified within their learning environment. I would love to be able to protect them better, and I wish i didn't have to sent them to this school. I felt that other schools probably had the same issues and, from this site, it seems I was right. I can't homeschool them as I need to work. I feel I don't have any choice but to send my girls where I know they are subjected to continual verbal abuse and the knocking of their confidence daily. This totally brakes my heart as a mother.",,
"at my school i have had a boy run his hand up my leg multiple times, had the same boy grab my arse even though i’ve told him multiple times it made me uncomfortable and i hated it, and had multiple boys grab my chest. they have also body shamed me called me flat and ugly. this happened when i was 12-13",,
"After coming back from clubbing with my friend I meet a few guys on the way to her accommodation who walked with us as I knew one of them ,his friend was hitting on me and asked if I can hang around with him for a bit and I was like Yh ok as I thought we were just going to chill but no he kept on begging me to have sex and I kept saying no as I didn’t want to lose my virginity to a guy I don’t know properly yet at all and I wanted to wait till marriage which I told him many times but he was like it does not even matter if I lose it now and then pulled my trousers and pants down so I turned my body away from him and he still begged me and rubbed his dick on my ass saying how I like it even if I didn’t and he then gave up and asked me to at least suck him off but I still kept on saying no and he wouldn’t listen so I gave up at the end and sucked him off as I just wanted all the begging to stop but even after he kept begging for sex and I kept saying no and he then asked me if I can just on top of him where his dick will just touch my entrance and not go in and I ride back and forth which I did for like a sec as I didn’t know what else to do to save myself and got off as I was scared thinking he might penetrate me.",,
"My first time was with my cheating ex, i was 14 and not ready we were going on a family getaway with his family, so every time he asked to i said no i’m not ready maybe on the little holiday we were going on if i’m ready. The time came we were away and it was the first night and he was more persistent this time and pressured me after i told him i was not ready but he was saying stuff like “you promised” etc which undermined me and i felt pressured to do it. 14 IS a young age to lose your virginity and i should’ve stuck up for myself more",,
"when i was 14 there was a history teacher (who is still a teacher at my high school 4 years later) openly made jokes about my vagina and made sexual comments about me infront of my entire class, i reported it and went to meetings alone so therefore i wasn’t listened to and collected statements from peers but they decided it was best to blame me for his words and moved me out of class which messed up all my lessons and GCSE exams.",,
"When I was 14, a man grabbed my breast from behind on a tube station escalator. Earlier on the train, I had caught his eye by mistake whilst I was looking around the carriage. So I thought it was my fault. So I didn’t tell anyone. I already felt strange about my body changing and this made me hate myself more. I didn’t wear anything tight fitting until I was in my twenties. I have never let men touch my breasts, it feels too strange. I couldn’t cope when the midwife tried to help me breastfeed when I had a baby. I have never been able to feel comfortable with sex. I am now nearly 50. I could only even tell anyone about this decades after it happened and only then realised it was not my fault and that it was a crime. I’m not saying that this event was the reason I have struggled with things. But it certainly didn’t help!",,
"When i was in year eight, my teacher asked why my pencil was behind my ear and i responded that it was just i place i could put it. He then replied by saying “i can think of another place to put it but it’s more hidden and painful”. he also made comments about wanting to see me run naked on sports day. i felt so uncomfortable because of these comments but everyone told me it was just his sense of humour or that i was being dramatic. i shook it off as an inappropriate joke and told myself it was nothing. it was only a few years later that it was revealed to the school he was being sent to prison for child pornography and paying men to rape young girls and film it for him did i really realise how awful he was. whilst all the students were laughing at this information, i burst into tears. i am so thankful that he only ever said things to me but it’s made me realise that jokes about rape etc should never be taken as “just a joke”"",When I was 15 an older boy put some tablets in my cola when I was hanging out with friends. (I didn’t realise until I had nearly drunk it) I have no idea what it was but I felt altered and wanted to go home, he raped me in a stair well. I ended up in hospital and found he’d also given me an infection as well as crabs. I haven’t told my family to this day. I think they thought I was just living a bad life still. I’ve never corrected this as it was to hard to talk about as no one supported me before. I was to young i didn’t know how.",,
It Was In Year 7 I Was In Math And My Teacher Told Me To Wait After Class So I Did And He Said That I Was Doing Great After Around 5 Minutes He Touched My Leg And I Felt A Little Bit Uncomfortable And i Tried To Push It Off My Leg And He Grabbed My Hand And Said Stop So At This Point I Was Panicking Because He Started To Move His Hand Up My Skirt So I Screamed And My Head Of Year Came In And He Seen And The Teacher Has Now Been Fired,,
"I’m scared my dad was inappropriate with me from a young age, consequently I’ve had so many disgusting intrusive thoughts about the fact growing up and towards others in general. I hate my mind, I’ve tried to escape through other men, older men, I feel disgusted, I didn’t want to grow up because I knew deep down that these men wouldn’t want me anymore. My soul aches, the innocence was never there.",,
"I was sexually harassed by the same boy for 5 years straight yet none of the teacher did anything he would place his hand on my neck and drag it down to my legs under my skirt. He said it was a joke and that he was just playing around so I went along with it until his friends started joining in, one of them grabbed my neck and ran his hand down to my chest and the other one ran his hands up my legs under my dress. It was warm outside so I would usually wear the school summer dress but because of the though of them constantly touching me inappropriately I stopped wearing dresses and skirt and started to wear trousers more. I felt uncomfortable so I told a teacher but he just told me I was overreacting and that they where just joking.",,
I was touched up in my school in a lesson,,
"I was at a party with my best male friend of almost four years. I was so drunk and so was he and he kept flirting with me in a really uncomfortable way which was completely unlike our usual relationship. He ended up getting in my Uber home and forcefully kissing me against the wall, which I kind of went along with because I was feeling sad about myself so wanted a confidence boost. He came into my house with me and initiated sex despite me telling him continuously that I didn’t want to / to stop. Eventually we had sex and I felt so disgusting and uncomfortable I made him stop and leave. I have never told anyone as he was seeing a girl I know and I feel like all of our friends would judge me for it. I later found out he had moved to multiple girls at the party and was basically just desperate to have sex with someone. I realised afterwards I completely didn’t want to sleep with him and it was his aggression and forcefulness that made me want to just do it to stop him being pushy. I have yet to tell a single person because I feel so disgusted by it even though I was so drunk.",,
"he made me go into the school toilets with him, he also touched me with everyone around, i gave no consent",,
"I hope it is okay for me to submitt my story aa I am.now in my 50s but it has made me sad to realise how little has changed for the better for girls & women in 2021. My first experience was at the age of 16 at my Saturday job. This was 1978. The male manager was probably in his late 30s to early 40s and although a softly spoken man with what initially seemed like a kind personality he often would make very suggestieve & sexual comments about what I was wearing when I was stacking shelves.I was very shy & needed the job so I could only smile politely. Worst of all though when I was on the till and had to cash up with him at the end of the day, just me & him in his small office which was quite a nerve wracking experience as it was but as I was counting the money he would always run his hands all over my body lingering on my breasts. I hadn't ever had a serious boyfriend at that stage so it was deeply uncomfortable. Upon speaking to a few of the other young Saturday girls it turned out it was at least 3 of us were also being subjected to this and we would discuss in hushed tones how we dreaded being on the tills knowing what to come at cash up time. We were always relieved if he was ever on a,day off. Not one of us told our parents. I think we thought it was our own fault somehow or just to be expected as we were young females. I thought it was awful but something we had moved on from as girls & women got more confident in themselves over the years with much mote female empowerment being encouragd. However , just a,few years ago it was my last day working on a reception desk in the City of London & on this occasion a 'VIP' cliënt who I had always had a,very nice but professional conversation with when he visites, came round to my side of the desk and gave me a hug to say goodbye but suddenly & so unexpectedly quickly ran his hands over my breasts. I was so shocked and totally speachless & really thought I must have imagined it. It was only that my reception colleague has somehow witnessed the whole thing from the silver photo frame on her side of the desk. She was outraged and urged me to report it to my bosses but it was last day there & had been a lovely day of cards & gifts so I didn't want to rock the boat as well as he was their most 'important client. In between these times I have experienced other workplace nuisances like bum slapping etc by men . Since then I have suffered personal guilt that I experienced those 2 upsetting experiences both in my mid teens and also in my middle age and that I must have somehow invited them and by not reporting them , these 2 men have probably have done this or worse to other girls & women. I know many people will have experienced much more awful things happening to them but what has stuck me most is that nothing has changed for girls and young women today and it seems to be even worse. Thank you for listening and wishing you all strength ,love & safety ❤",,
"A boy from another school was hanging out with my cousin while and was there and me, him, my cousin,and a few other people were all in the pool. He kept slapping my ass and picking me up when i told him ti stop",,
My daughter came home recently after I signed forms to give my consent for her to receive sex education in school when she got home she asked me if she could talk to me about a group of boys in her class making sexual gestures towards her and the girls around her she said she felt someone's hand on her back and felt the back of her bra ping back she asked the boys what do you think you are doing and who was it they just laughed she lost her temper and told them if they touch her again she won't be responsible for her actions due to this she got into trouble off the teacher furiouse about it she took it to the the head of year who said boys will be boys one of her friends had a pastel coloured bra on and she was told that would only encourage them however my daughter had a white bra on same colour as her school shirt and she received the same treatment it still carries on today but is worse when they receive sex education,,
"A group of boys collect photos of girls nudes, at the end of the week they share them together and make it a competition to see who has the most. They keep the pictures in a folder and go back over at the end of the year",,
"For 3 years i was catcalled and touched up by 3 male sports teachers, other teachers knew but did nothing. One day after school i wen to the smoking shelter in broad daylight and one of the sports teachers found me, pushed me against the wall and forced his tongue inside me whilst groping my breasts. I never said anything as i was scared i'd be expelled.",,
I was raped by a student in my year group at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I tried to tell my head of house but was told that I was lying and was offered no help. I had to sit next to my rapist in lessons- he harassed me about the fact he had raped me and got away with it. The school took his side. I have attempted suicide repeatedly because of the way I was treated by this boy and the school. The whole year group knows that he raped me and that nothing was done.,,
I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend who told me this was supposed to happen and this is what everyone was expecting us to do. He manipulated it so much that I didn’t even realise I had been assaulted until 2 years later. Our relationship had well ended by then but it has impacted my life ever since that night. I find it really hard to trust my relationships with people and I developed what I assumed to be independence but was anxiety and a closed-off personality.,,
"I met someone online when I was 16. He was a ‘friend’ but constantly asked for nudes. At the time I had zero self respect for myself and my body and given he was much older than me (21) I thought it would make me cool in his eyes. I became very uncomfortable after a while and eventually bit the bullet and unfollowed him on everything and removed his number.,A year passed... I was much happier and had a boyfriend. One day out of the blue he found a way to message me again. We started talking, I told him I had a boyfriend and he was respectful of that. It seemed he’d matured so when he asked to meet ‘just as friends’ I agreed. I made him promise several times not to try anything and he said he wouldn’t so we arranged to meet in a public place.,I arrived at the tube station and as soon as he saw me he grabbed my hand and dragged me through the streets, stopping only to try and kiss me and telling me that if I shouted or called for help he’d hurt me. If at any point I tried to get away he’d just grab me tighter and by this point he’d manoeuvred us into very empty side streets so there was no one around. Eventually we got to a small alcove beside a church... he shoved me backwards and hit my face repeatedly. I was completely shocked and tried to run away but he slammed me back against the wall. He put his hands on my shoulders and forced me down onto my knees. He then proceeded to ‘have sex with my mouth’. He gripped my hair in his hands, occasionally stopping to hit me to make sure I didn’t try to run away again. He assaulted me until he was finished at which point he grabbed my neck, spat on my face and left. As soon as he was gone I threw up and sat there shaking for a few hours until I summoned up the courage to go home.,In the aftermath of this, my relationship with my boyfriend started to deteriorate (eventually we split up) and my mental health declined rapidly. I didn’t tell anyone what happened to me for about 6 months until I had a breakdown and told my best friend. I didn’t feel able to tell my mum because she’d experienced major assault when she was younger and I didn’t want to hurt her.,Nothing much has happened about it since other than that I’ve now talked to lots of people about it and am now in a better place. I haven’t pressed charges.",,
They sent me unsolicited pictures and continuously asked for my nudes and I refused so they began to fetishise me (im a black girl). They would say that all I would ever be good for is being raped and used cause no one would ever want to date a black slut.,,
I got sexually harrased in primary school by male students and secondary school by a teacher,,
"It was [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], just before lockdown and I went to a party. I was drugged and raped by a group of around 6 boys from the rugby squad, I won’t include names but they’ve done it to 4 other girls I know of and also have girlfriends. They’re now in year 13",,
"We share a coach service with a boys school that is next to ours, to get to and from school. At the beginning of this academic year, due to the pandemic, girls who were not in sixth form (sixth formers have no uniform) were allowed to come into school in their sports kit as the changing rooms were closed. Our sports kit consists of a skort (skirt with shorts underneath), a t-shirt and a jumper. My younger sister came home from school one day saying that they had been told, by our school, to wear tracksuit bottoms over their skorts on the bus because the boys were getting ‘distracted’ by their outfits. My sister is 13. It’s disgusting to think that 13 year olds are being sexualised whilst wearing the school mandated uniform, and are then getting blamed for it.",,
is was like 12 when this happened and it was by my favourite teacher. he was literally so nice but i guess he wasn't. he told me to stay back after one of my classes and he forced himself onto me. im now 16 years old and it still scares me.,,
"One time when I was walking home from school, a group of teenage girls started following me, throwing rocks and cans at me, and making fun of my private school uniform. They started getting closer to me, so I started running until I saw a group of older people wearing my uniform, and the boys started chasing the girls away, shouting swear words at them. I know that it is not that big of a deal, but I still wanted to share, as I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't run into that group of people.",,
"school is draining me so much. i havent stopped sh for months and im trying so much but idk what to do anymore.i get begged for nudes daily, i cant send.. i tell myself. but then they wont love me anymore, another voice in my head tells me. everything is so overwhelming.",,
"I was sexually harrassed from the day of taking up post by my line manager on a daily basis over a 6 month period. I and a colleague took this to a tribunal, he was encouraged to take early retirement but allowed to work in the same office for a further three months. He was apparently known throughout the sector for this behaviour for over 20 years",,
"When I was at sixth form quite a few years ago now, I was a victim of a crime I know now is called ""assault by penetration"", at a party. I sobbed that night and then the next day I just blocked it out of my mind - I blamed myself for having got drunk enough to put myself in a vulnerable position, and for trusting people I thought were friends. He didn't seem to realise you were legally supposed to check someone wanted to do something sexual before you go ahead and do it. At the time, the prevailing understanding among the boys seemed to be that unless or until someone screamed ""no"" loud enough and pushed you away hard enough it was fair game to do whatever you wanted to their body without consent, even if they were passed out drunk. His school clearly hadn't taught them what consent was and there was a toxic culture of boasting about their conquests. He won't remember my name, but some years after I had a breakdown and had trauma therapy, and even now, many years later, it still affects me at times. I'd hoped things had changed since then, but judging by this site clearly not. I think he's happy and he's probably not a bad guy now, I don't know, I don't hate him at all or want him to be punished, but I just wish all schools taught students in depth about consent, I don't think it would have happened if he understood it was a crime. Sending so much love to all survivors. I hope things change for the better someday and less girls have to go through this.",,
I was about 14 and at a houseparty and got blackout drunk (one of the first times I’d drink properly). My mate put me to bed and returned to find two of my male school mates taking my clothes off (they were also about 14) while I was unconscious,,
when i didn’t send my ex nudes for awhile he manipulated me and continuously humiliated me after we broke up. he constantly asked for head when i repeatedly said no.,,
A guy in my year created a rating chart for the girls with like 12 categories including race and bmi. U got full marks if u were white and more marks the lower ur bmi was. This was when we were like 15/16,,
"I never reported it or really told anyone about it in any detail until this. When I was 9 years old I had a really abusive 16year old babysitter. He used to whip me and my 5 year old brother with wet tea towels. One time I was watching TV and my little brother was asleep on the arm chair nearby. My babysitter asked for a hand job. He said my mum did it all the time for her job and if I didn't do it he'd wake up my baby brother and make him do it. My next door neighbour (who was only 10) walked in on us and the babysitter dragged him outside beat him up, dragged his face across chicken wire and then dumped him in a stream. I grabbed my brother and climbed up the tallest tree in the garden and stayed there for hours until my mum came home. I didn't tell her what happened but I didn't see the babysitter again. Years later I told her about it and she said ""get over it everyone gets raped"". I often feel bad that I didn't report it but I also feel guilty that I let it happen. I don't know what happened to that babysitter but I do often think that I'm probably not the only victim and that's my fault. It still affects me years later.",,
"In my first year at University, I was blackout drunk and met a guy who also lived on campus. I went back to his very drunk, he tried to have sex with me and I left immediately in tears, without my bank card which I picked up from his flatmate the next day.",,
"3 months into College, just after my 17th birthday I was raped by my best friend. He took advantage of my vulnerability and I feel stupid to of trusted him. It took me over 2 years to realise what had happened and I feel so angry, ashamed and helpless because I had no one to talk to at that time. I was emotionally numb. I was in a football college which was predominantly male. I was 1 of 3 girls in my class and there were only a few more in the year above. We were at my dads house on the bed in my room. My dad was away on holiday and my brother was downstairs at this point. My supposed “best friend” started to take off the clothes below my waist and began to go down on me without my consent however I was too scared to hurt his feelings or to say no at that point. My brother soon left and called out to say goodbye and once he shut the door behind him, my ‘best friend’ got out of my bed and started to undress himself. He asked me “Are you sure?” To which I said “No” but that didn’t stop him. He put on a condom and got on top of me. I froze. Once he was in I felt i had left my body. He began to undress my top half and told me to put my arms around him. The last thing i remember is laying next to him not knowing what had just happened. To this day, I fear intimacy. I can’t break out of it. I feel so trapped. I thought I was ok but i’m not. Now all I want to do is be alone, I don’t want to be touched. I don’t want pity. I just want people to take accountability for their actions. All we can do is educate kids from a young age but I’m scared there isn’t enough funding to support sexual education."",I was with this person for a while and when we first started the relationship I felt this rush that we had sex. As one of the first serious relationships in our year it was almost forced that we hadn’t had sex by the boys in our year. I felt some pressure to give myself up and just do it because all the boys would be like “you still haven’t beat yet, it has only been 2 months”. I was 14 at the time I wasn’t ready for anything yet and I guess I put myself in that position because I got into a relationship. We clicked instantly we had the best chemistry and got on so well, so I trusted him and I trusted that what we did wasn’t going to be told to anyone as it is private and I said to him please don’t tell anyone I don’t want anyone to know. I go to school on the Monday and people are coming up to me saying “how was it” before I had even spoken to him that day. I went straight to the toilets and cried because everyone was talking about it. During the relationship because we had done so much stuff earlier on I felt he would get bored of me and would try things I didn’t want to do nor were ready to do. He would always ask let’s try this and when I would be like “I am not sure yet”, he would move me and put me in that position anyway. Constantly during the relationship I would say no or not be in the mood to have sex and would feel like because I was in the relationship I had to do it. There was this time where we tried something new, I told him please stop it is hurting pushing my arm against his shoulder to get him away from me but he said “I am in now I might as well carry on” and “it’s just a bit of pain, do it for me”. He would ask I can stop if you want me to but I knew from experiences before that with him that he would be grumpy or make me feel guilty. Another time was when I said no and he said “when you say no it means yes”, I said to him that this doesn’t mean that and when I say no it means no. There was another when I wasn’t in the mood and I think I had only said I wasn’t in the mood and I probably didn’t make it clear enough but that day he would put his whole body weight on me and I would struggle, I nearly cried and was in shock laying there on his bed while after he was done he just went to sleep. There were also multiple times when he would make me feels so guilty by saying “I am so horny and you’re my girlfriend you should want to have sex with me” or “you don’t like me anymore do you?”and I would just feel like I had to give in and say fine just get it over with. There were times so that he didn’t feel upset I would let him have sex with me and I would just tell myself it will be over soon. This isn’t me saying I didn’t like him no more it is just me saying it is not a thing that is always wanted it is something that is precious and should be something that you want to do. After sex I would go out of the room and just sit on the toilet (pretend I was on the toilet) to just cry and try and pull myself together. I just felt that my body was being taken over and that I wasn’t worth anything, but I stayed because I thought in a sense this was normal and was meant to happen. These are just a few times. When we got out of the relationship, I told a close friend what had happened she told me that is wasn’t right and that I need to speak to someone about it, she was disgusted and she was the one who made me realise that what had happen to me was not right at all. When I think back to these times, my heart aches like it is now, IT ACTUALLY ACHES. I can’t explain how I felt during the first lockdown I thought because no one believes or would believe me that I had to deal with the whole situation myself so I did. I cried every day and night, I cried whilst drifting off to sleep and this happened for about 2 months. I finally opened up to my mum and told her exactly what happened. I also opened up to friends who were and are friends with him and told them about what had happened to me. I didn’t explain in depth because I didn’t feel like I needed to as I thought that they would believe me straight away but I was wrong. I told the wrong person and then it got back to the person. This then caused him and I to have a conversation where he admitted to himself and I that he had pressured me and then apologised, but then till this day tells everyone the opposite making and telling people that I am a liar and still loved him and was also doing this all for attention. After this conversation he went downstairs to the party where he had found out and this then started to speak to my friends and tell them that he didn’t do anything to me. This was then left till the next weekend when I was at goose green with my new school friends and my friends who were still friends with him came along I specifically asked them to not bri""",,
"Me and my friends used to sit on a particular wall when we had lunch and I was walking over by myself. A group of boys in my year then yelled over to me ‘hey sexy!’ and ‘you look like a used tampon’ (I had red hair at the time). I was so disgusted and violated and reported it to the school. Nothing has been done and one of my male friends even said that I should have taken it as a complement and that I was overreacting. The worst part is that I sometimes wonder if he was right, even if I know that what they did was wrong. It’s awful.",,
I was being bullied for being a virgin at 14. My head of year told my parents I should try to fit in and be like the others so they would stop picking on me. 1 year later I was sexually abused by one of the sixth form boys.,,
"forced to perform sexual activity with an ex boyfriend, friends were similar",,
"As a child I was routinely beaten by my stepfather, made to do all the housework and look after my younger siblings. When I was older, we got away. I was sexually assaulted by my siblings cousin and beaten by my mothers boyfriend's son. I was sexually assaulted by my friends brother. I've been groped and handled in pubs, and clubs. I have been the victim of sexual harassment in the workplace more times than I can count, not just verbal, but physical too. As a younger I despised all men, and was afraid constantly. As an adult (41) I take no shit from anyone, if anyone lays a hand on me, it's their funeral. I know other women/girls who have been abused and raped by their own fathers. It isn't just women that suffer, I know, but most murderers, rapists and abusers are male, and most victims female. When I think of how girls and women are treated the world over with some cultures seeing us as less than human, 'OUR LIVES MATTER' must be first and foremost in all our minds. We have lived in the shadow of fear for far too long, we are strong, we are wise and we are many. My daughter will grow up knowing she is important, valued, loved and most of all safe.",,
"When my friends and I went clubbing, I got groped by a random guy. I was in between 2 of my friends, one behind the other, when a stranger came behind me and rubbed his hand underneath legs and went up against my bum. Before I could say anything, he disappeared. My guy friend behind me said nothing and didn't try and stop the stranger from doing an impulsive act. Despite me feeling uncomfortable and disgusted, my friends (both girls and boys) thought that it was my fault the guy did this and that the ""unwanted attention"" I received that night was because of me as I was looking at them. I was very drunk and my eyes were wondering about looking at everyone. However, I was made to believe that I was in the wrong. That I asked to be groped.",,
"I was only 14 when this happend. Dragged into a closed secure closet, if you were to scream, no one could hear you. 3 boys 1 girl. 2 boys holding me down, 1 was at it. One by one until they were done, left me on the floor. Until someone came in.",,
I lost my virginity to a guy who didn’t even ask for consent - just went ahead and only paused when I told him I was a virgin. He didn’t take into account how painful it was for me and was completely only trying to satisfy his own pleasure. Since then I’ve just been viewed as a sex tool for him when I was left with some pretty real things to deal with after that - in terms of regret especially,,
There was multiple boys that were known for sexually harassing or assaulting girls in my year but no matter how much evidence we provided the school they blew it off and said it was just boys being boys and the girls need to wear longer skirts ( even though they were length) The safeguarding team would exclude the girls for standing up for themselves and pushing boys off them when they would grope us on corridors or look up our skirts. We were told trousers were necessary to stop us from distracting male staff and students. If lesbians can control themselves around women why can’t males.,,
"I was known for having large breasts at school and had them groped everyday, atleast 3x a day for my last 2 year's at secondary school. My chest was constantly covered in bruises. I couldnt walk down a corridor without some random lad grabbing me.",,
Once a week I had this lesson where the classroom we were in was very confined and had way too many students sitting in it for the size of and I was sitting near the back so It was very easy to get away with things and the boy I was sitting next to made me extremely uncomfortable by invading my space with his legs under the table and he started touching me and it would go on every week so I always dreaded the lesson but was to scared to speak out. Anyways eventually he started putting his hand up my skirt and one week he put his hand up my shirt touched me and I wasn't wearing a bra because I was literally 12 years old. [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is such an insanely strict school which meant I was to scared to verbally tell him to stop because I didn't want to get in trouble for talking when everybody was silent. At one point I even remember writing a note one a piece of paper that said stop and giving it to him but obviously it didn't do anything. This happened to me for multiple weeks and this boy has dont this to multiple girls and nothing has been done about it. Eventually I got the courage to ask the teacher to be moved seats because I was 'uncomfortable'.,,
"When I was in 6th grade a guy that I didn’t know walked up behind me and slapped my butt, then proceeded to walk away without saying a single world.",,
A man in my weight classroom smacked my ass in front of everyone.,,
"I was spiked recently at a house party. I’m on holiday right now and 2 days ago I was invited to a house party with a few friends. As soon as we walked in the door I was offered a beer, it was opened. That was the only drink I had that evening. Shortly after I completely blacked out and have no memory of what happened that night. The following morning I woke up in a strange apartment by myself in someone else’s clothes. I have bruises all over me. The next day I spent passed out in my bed. I am convinced I was spiked and even more convinced someone assaulted me. I don’t know what happened and quite frankly I’m not sure I want to know. I’ve been avoiding all messages from my friends because I’m terrified to find out what happened.",,
I’m a girl. I wouldn’t say pretty but I had a few guys that would grope me a lot and say some pretty nasty things. One time a girl even ran up to me and groped me. One year my sexual assaulter was at the same school as me. He couldn’t even look at me and I made myself sick with an eating disorder so I wouldn’t have to go to school and possibly see him. The day he transferred was the day I felt released from hell.,,
I was manipulated and emotionally/physically/sexually abused for months in the back of class and in the stairwells. I was so numb and he made me believe that I wasn’t enough for anyone. I didn’t see a way out so I would get random bfs just for him to stop. Finally when COVID hit I was free and I haven’t been back to that school since.,,
"Sexually assaulted at the age of three by a 12 year old boy. Saw a flasher masturbating at me at the ages of 7 and 12, sexually assaulted by 2 girls in the toilets at Aultbea primary in the Scottish highlands, my friends dad came on to me in front of her at age 12 in Aultbea. I worked in the NHS and a male patient grabbed me and tried to stick his tongue down my throat, his wife was standing beside him. Another patient did the same thing, this guy was mentally disabled but the male nurse who was with him thought it was really funny. On three other occasions I have had men grabbing me and trying to stick their tongues down my throat. I have had my backside grabbed in pubs and at concerts. In one relationship I was physically assaulted and forced to have sex, in another I was physically and mentally abused. I am 56 now and thought I was past all this but 4 years ago I was groped by someone I thought of as a family friend and it made me ill for months. I have a 14 year old daughter and it makes me feel sick to think that anything like this could happen to her.",,
"So last year in March I was with a person, let’s name him Jacob (not using real name) but I fell asleep at this little den we made at an abandoned farm, it had shelter and a mattress was in there and everything, prior to that we was there for a good couple or hours before I fell asleep as I had been on my feet all day and I was aching and I just wanted to lie down but “Jacob” wouldn’t let me go home until my mum rang me, baring in mind my mom would only ring me if I’m late home. Anyways I had fell asleep in this den we had made and I felt some movement but thought nothing of it as you know I thought I could trust him at the time, which clearly was a stupid mistake. When I woke up he realised I had woken up and pinned my arms down but I was too scared to say anything plus I couldn’t move as my hand were behind my back pinned down. He was going for a good 15 mins before he finished and every time I felt it go in the more upset i got because i let this happen. I didn’t speak up and I really wish I did because people like that don’t deserve to be out in the world especially with the young innocent kids out there!",,
"I was walking on the street and I was crying because I was upset. A man came up to me and started asking what was wrong and for my number. When I said no he came closer and started hugging me, I tried pulling away but he didn’t stop. He then started kissing my cheeks and my lips and when I finally got out of his grip, he followed me home asking for my number. I couldn’t leave the house for a month without something to defend myself with or someone with me because I was really scared he was gonna come back because he knows where I live.",,
"I don't know if this was sexual assault or not, part of me thinks it was not part of me thinks I'm overreacting. I was close platonic friends with a guy in university, but I made it clear that I wasn't into him like that, extremely explicitly clear that I had no interest in him at all. One night I was extremely drunk, at my own house, and he came over. I was so drunk that I have almost no memory of it , but what j do remember is kissing and him trying to finger me and it hurting. Then he said I was too drunk and he left. I woke up the next day and felt so dirty and wrong, I couldn't remember who initiated it because I was so wasted but I found texts on my phone that he'd written to people and he was almost if not entirely sober when I couldn't walk nor see and couldn't type. We've not spoken since and I haven't told anyone except my closest friend. I don't know if it was assault because I don't think I resisted or froze and I think I ""participated"" actively but Im almost sure I was way too drunk to consent. I don't know what to do and I'm too scared to discuss it in case it wasn't assault and I'd be a bad person. It's the only sexual experience I've had and I had flashbacks and trouble sleeping for months afterwards",,
"This guy on a cadet weekend camp kept on touching me inappropriately, he was finding it funny with his mate even tho I told him to stop. He kept telling me he knew I liked it which I did not. He emotionally manipulated me and told me if I didn’t do what he wanted he would kill himself. It made me feel worthless. He told me I’m not a man as I’m trans ftm and how he would “make me normal” and all other stuff. I kept on blocking him and then unblocking him because if he killed himself I felt like that was on me. I tried to talk about it but was shut down many times. He told me over text he didn’t care whether I consented to anything including being sent photos and being forced to send them back by telling me if I didn’t he would tell everyone I know that I did.",,
"At 14 at a party my boyfriend at the time (also 14) pulled me into the bathroom, locked the door, grabbed my head and forced to give him oral sex. He finished, let go of my head and I flopped to the floor. He got up and left and I sat and cried. Friends and others at school called me a slag.",,

I was 13 and this year 11 who was 16 would repeatedly catcall and make Inappropriate gestures to me this was happening over about two months until he got five of his friends to join into over the next two months they continued making rude comments and inappropriate gestures towards my body and how it should be used for men’s purposes on [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] they beat me up sexually assaulted me by touching my breasts and bum I got nocked unconscious and I woke up with my cloths loose and leggings pulled down - I don’t know to this day if I got raped or not but I’m trying my hardest to forget about it.,,
Sexual abuse by three students. One rape one attempted rape. Left with PTSD.,,
"When I was at school I had many incidents that made me really uncomfortable about my sexuality and also launched me into the world of sex prematurely. I remember being 12, I had been through puberty very early and was quite big Chested. This made me the target of a “big tits” nickname and daily pinging of bra straps. When I was 13 I was raped by someone I thought was my best friend who went to scripture union with me, he told me it was the only way to know I liked him. When I was 14 I was in an abusive relationship, when we broke up he told a teacher that I made up the abuse and that I also made up that I was raped the year before. The teacher asked me what had happened but because of my fear of what would happen I agreed that I made it up. From then the teacher looked at me differently, I was bullied by others, I found it difficult to navigate the world i had been opened up to and the teachers did nothing to stop the sexual abuse that went on for many girls around the school. It’s is heartbreaking that this continues in our schools today.",,
"I was having sex with a 'friend' - I had given consent but pretty much as soon as it started it really hurt and I realised that I didn't want to do it anymore. I told him and asked him to stop but he just kept going, pinned my arms down and wouldn't stop.",,
"I was at a house party. I had a girlfriend. She wasn't there. This girl who I had gotten with in the past was there, and knew I had a girlfriend. She kept telling me that we should go to a quieter room to talk and I kept saying no because I knew what that would mean. She didn't stop so I went with her. We talked but she kept leaning in for kisses and I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that I had a girlfriend . She said that it's okay to ""make mistakes"" and she put her leg on my leg and kept touching me. I tried to leave but she said that she was so drunk I needed to make sure she was okay. I eventually just left anyway and she started crying.",,
"Is it too much to ask to be treated with the same respect as a man would? To receive the same consideration, acknowledgment and validation a man would? This is still not happening in our everyday reality, we are still very far from it. I have grown up in a patriarchal culture and the fact that I am a woman has affected the whole of my life. As a little girl, I was abused by a violent father and ignored by an absent mother. Growing up I have continuously been the object of male unwanted attentions, and repetitive forms of abuse, either physical, verbal or psychologicall. Even now that I am a middle-aged woman with a strong educational background, I am still regularly experiencing forms of gender discrimination and undermining of my voice as a woman. Only recently I had to write a formal complain about my daughter's primary school for the way I was intimidated, silenced and undermined simply for raising educated concerns about the quality of on-line learning. I am pretty sure that had I been a man with the same level of education expressing similar concerns, I would have been treated differently. Obviously, the Head Teacher is a man. What is still very frustrating is the fact that however there is an important on-going debate about sexual/gender discrimantion and harassment, it is still extremely difficult for women to have their experiences of abuse and injustice validated. I am happy for my two girls and for the new generation of women because at least we are giving them the instruments to recognise what is acceptable and what it is not and that you do not have to put up with situations and behaviours that make them uncomfortable as women. It is important to set up clear boundaries, which are not only the result of subjective views but an objective recognition of what a respectufl behaviour is.",,
I Go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in year nine a boy who goes there attempted to rape me I spoke out I didn't want it happen to other girls I told college and they said you can't make accusations like that and we'll he's not in the same floor for lectures her first response the lecturer that is was to write a name down on a piece of paper recently I've saw in the college that he's hanging around another girl I'm stuck on what to do college refuse to do anything about him being there. I'm stuck and in a tough position do I say and get told I'm lying and shut down by the girl herself and approach and warn her as no one else is keeping an eye on what's happening in college. Including the people I mentioned it 3 plus times to lecturers but no nothings done. Seeing him is unpleasant there as it is seeing [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with another girl is damnright disturbing knowing the extent he has gone to for sexual pleasure despite me saying there's disinterest multiple times he told me I don't care multiple times this way years ago now.,,
"When i was about 15 years old I went to a party in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The party was about a 2 minute walk from the station and at around 9-30pm i walked with another girl and 2 to drop 2 boys at the station. on the way back after the boys had left us on a brightly lit road with shops, I got surrounded by about 10 boys who would not let us leave. as I tried pushing through one of them grabbed me by the back of the neck and tried touching my tits and put his hand under my skirt. he told me i was asking for it because i had a crop top and skirt on a looked like i wanted it. after I kicked them and ran I had a panic attack and collapsed. this was the first time of many that i had been assaulted. these things will live with me and haunt me forever and and i will never trust a boy the same way.",,
"I was 8/9 when I started to talk to my friend's brother. He was cool at first but then he started to ask me if I wanted to go out with him and later on he asked me if I knew what sex was. The guy was in high school and I was in Elementary. I felt uncomfortable around him but I couldn't tell anyone because I still wanted to hangout with my friend. After a month, he started to get closer to me and started to touch me. I thought this was normal so I never said no. I stopped talking to my friend when middle school started. He's out of school but when I see him at a store, I always see him looking at me. I always distance myself from him and go to the front of the store just in case anything happens.",,
"When i was 15 years old, I was at a party incredibly drunk and a boy and I started making out and he took me to a room for some privacy. He started taking off my clothes and I began to feel uncomfortable with where the situation was headed, so I said no, but he kept going anyway. I felt completely frozen and woke up the next day with bruises over my body. It’s a blurry memory, so I began to wonder whether I had even said no, which led me to believe that it could have been consensual because I he may not have known what he was doing was wrong. After this night I went through various phases of depression and anorexia, and it still affects me almost a year later. A lot of people don’t seem to understand the long term affects of their actions, but they should be held accountable for them.",,
"I was in my GCSE year in my class and sitting next to me was a typical swim boy who I was friends with. It was fine sitting next to him and we were getting along until he kept trying to touch my leg and then he would continue to get closer and closer to my private part. I was trying to pull his hand away but he was fighting it and he was stronger. I would cross my legs and lean away from him and he’d pull on my leg and try and unravel it. Eventually after about 10-15 minutes of this, my teacher (who also is male) saw and just said “[boy’s name], hands to yourself please.” That was it. He was never punished or spoken to at the end of the lesson. I was never approached by my teacher to ask if I was okay or what happen. A typical Millfield boy tried to forcefully finger me in the middle of the lesson. And then nothing. It was never spoken about and I never spoke to him again.",,
the boys looked up my skirt making rude comments,,
"It was my first year at university and everyone had already gone home for the Christmas holidays. I was watching a film and a guy who was still at uni asked if he could come over and I said yes. As time went by and the film finished we just ended up chilling until we started to fall asleep as it was late. We started to kiss until he started to touch parts of my body. With shock I froze and couldn’t say or do anything. He then asked if this was okay and I replied “I don’t know”. He then went on to touch me down there and didn’t stop. After a short time (which felt like forever) he stopped and went to go wank off in the bathroom. The next day I felt violated and alone and I couldn’t stop repeating the moment over and over in my head. This was 4 years ago but still effects me today. What made matters worse, was I found out a year later from this incident that this guy had being spreading rumours about me to all the boys that I give bad head and I lost my virginity to him (even tho I was still a virgin for the entirety of university). People who I thought were my friends had been spreading these rumours behind my back not asking me but just assuming it was true. He has ruined a part of me and he probably doesn’t even bat an eye about it even tho I know he has done it to other girls as well. I never reported it because I never knew if I was in the wrong or not. I didn’t say yes but I didn’t say no. I just know I never got the justice I deserved.",,
"When I was 16 I decided I would be intimate with a boy I had liked for a while. We began having sex for a while and there was a moment where my back was to him for many minutes. When I turned around it was not him- it was his 20-something year old cousin penetrating me and the boy I thought I was with was watching and filming. I immediately freaked out and said I was leaving, and they showed me that his friend had also been filming us having sex before he came in without my knowledge. I began crying, said I would call the police if he didn’t delete the video (bare in mind I had NO clue who this person was) and both boys teamed up against me and said they would post the video if I did not “finish the older cousin off”. He also offered me money for various acts. I went home, stared at my wall for a few hours and have since been quite numb. For about a week I continued to contact and threaten him with police to delete the video, but each time was met with blackmail and sexual requests until I gave up. I have no idea where the video is today.",,
"A friend of mine assaulted me and I stayed quiet for 2 years until he assaulted a friend of mine. I spoke out, and most of his male friends said nothing and stood by him by pretending nothing happened.",,
"In my school nude photos have been shared. Names such as ‘slut’ and ‘slag’ are used to degrade girls. A male pe teacher was messaging minors talking about how nice their bodies were, police was involved with the more serious stuff but nothing has changed.",,
"a teacher sexually harassed me, and other members of staff accused me of lying",,
"When i was 13 i was walking home from school, the same way i always do and an older boy from another school came up behind me, picked me up and humped me as i was crossing the road while laughing with his friends. i was walking alone. the next day i was walking with my friend and he did it again and only stopped when my friend grabbed my hand and pulled me away. i still have to walk that way home and i still get anxiety when i'm crossing that road 5 years later.",,
"i was in the dinner queue and a group of boys were in line in front of me, they all started chatting to each other about “who has the most balls to do it first” and i had no clue what they were on about. Suddenly 2 of the friends grabbed my ass on either side and they all started laughing together",,
"I was 15. My best friend had a party, it was the first time I was “wasted”. Went upstairs in her room to sleep off my spins...woke up to an older guy with his hands down the back of my pants. Threw up all over him, and her room. Somehow I was ashamed enough to not tell everyone.",,
"I had been seeing a boy for several months and we eventually went on our first real date out. He would always make comments about me being a “grandma” or “stiff” when I was sober, or “I prefer you when you’re drunk.” In the sick way that girls feel the need to make themselves more appealing to boys I was prepared to get drunk to “loosen up” so we drank a bottle of wine with dinner and had a shot at the end of the meal. Afterwards we headed to a bar to meet some friends and the shots continued and I wonder if maybe I was spiked there too. There was a charity event going on that night at our school which lots of our friends were involved in and we thought it would be fun to go and watch or join in. We picked up some more drinks and headed to school. I remember walking into the hall and downing the rest of my drink, flashes of some embarrassing conversations with boys in my sixth form and then blackout. I woke up the next morning in bed with the taste of vomit in my mouth and pain in my elbow and no recollection of how I had got home or when or how the evening had gone after I got to school. I had a sense that something horrible had happened so immediately texted the boy I was seeing to get him to fill in the memory blanks. He was cruel and manipulative - refusing to give me any details or full story, only dropping hints of what had happened. We had had sex in the school toilets in the middle of this charity event which is something I know and he knew I would never have done sober and in my right mind (especially as I was on my period at the time.) At some point during him having sex with me from behind he had actually looked at me properly and seen my eyes were absent and rolling around and I looked very unwell. I told him to leave me there alone because I didn’t want him to see me being sick( or so he said). I was vomiting for quite some time and I think he found me on the floor passed out in the mess. He put me in a cab and sent me home alone pretty much unconscious where my mum found me swaying on the doorstep dazed and confused. He said I was disgusting and he would be surprised if he wasn’t put off me for good. I begged him not to tell anyone what had happened as I was mortified and wanted to pretend the whole evening had never happened. Before I knew it it felt like everyone in my year and the year below knew as he had obviously bragged about it to his mates. He claimed someone who was in the toilet at the time had spread the gossip and my girlfriends were taking the piss out of me for having sex with him in a public place. I denied it to everyone or said I had no recollection of the night to try and stop people talking about it and eventually I managed to bury that night in the back of my mind. I continued seeing that boy until he got with some other girl and I realised what an idiot I had been to fall for his manipulation for so long. I hadn’t thought about the sex in the bathroom for over a year when I started to watch ‘I may destroy you.’ One scene in the bathroom brought back such a vivid and traumatic memory of that night and I broke down in front of my sisters, telling them for the first time what had happened. I had let him make me feel shame and disgust towards myself when he should have been the one disgusted with himself for having sex with me in that state. I’ve since blocked him on all platforms and so he labelled me a ‘psycho’ to one of my closest friends. He clearly has no idea or remorse about what he has done - apart from this episode also physically harming me and many of my friends and damaging the self esteems of other girls during relationships with them. These boys need to learn they cannot manipulate girls like this and girls must to be empowered to know they are far too good to stoop to boys with a lack of basic humanity.",,
"I had been with my boyfriend for about 7 months. On a weekend trip together I got quite upset about something and had a bath to calm myself down. About 10 minutes into my bath (still crying and visibly upset) I heard a noise and turned. I realised my boyfriend was standing outside of the door watching me through the crack, it didn’t seem like too much of a big deal so I jokingly told him to go away but he didn’t move. Feeling a little bit uncomfortable with him watching, still crying, I got out of the bath, put my pyjamas on and got into bed. He started kissing me but I was still upset over the previous thing so asked him to stop. He didn’t. He forced himself on me, I started crying again, I kept begging him to stop, I was crying the whole time and staring at the wall. Eventually I tried to shove him, he said ‘that’s so unfair, I’m almost there’, I was exhausted and fed up so just waited for it to finish. I felt like I couldn’t be upset about it because he was my boyfriend, but I knew he had taken advantage of me because I was in a low mood and vulnerable. Afterwards he got angry at me for acting ‘off’ with him. I continued dating him for another year and similar events happened, I tried to initiate multiple conversations about it, he always made stupid excuses until he started denying it happened, that’s when I broke up with him.",,
When I was 17 there was this guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] that I had met at a party. I went to his house a few weeks later and told him over text before that I didn’t know if I wanted to have or not. We started making out and then next thing I knew he was on top of me but I never said anything or told him to stop even though I wanted him to. I told him after that I was uncomfortable and he told me it was my fault for feeling that way.,,
"My testimony goes back to the 1980's in a comprehensive school in a large northern city. There were a handful of boys in my year who were known as sleazebags and we tried to avoid them. Aged 13 I was groped during my home economics lesson...I was ironing the cushion cover I'd made, my hands were busy and he approached me from behind. A tentative feel, I hissed ""get off me"", a full on rummage followed. I swung round, shaking, iron in hand, wondering whether I could get away with smashing his head with it or burning his face with the hot part. Instead I shouted very loudly ""f*** off (name), get your f****** hands off me!"" Teacher came down on ME like a ton of bricks for swearing in class. I stood my ground and said ""he was feeling my a**e and between my legs miss"". She didn't believe me at first and I felt just awful, knowing I was in deep trouble for my repeated swearing and refusing to apologise....I was so angry...then after what felt like years, another girl said quietly ""he did it to me too"", then another whispered ""he did it to me too, and felt my breasts"", then another ""he's done it to me a few times this week"", another ""me too, on Monday"".,My school dealt with it immediately which I was thankful for, and my reaction immediately excused....boy taken straight to the deputy head, suspended for a few days. I did think ""Thank God I spoke out"" but it worried me that nobody else had.,There was no mention of it again, no action to prevent the other sleazebags from upskirting, breaking into the girls changing rooms at PE (we all avoided the benches near the door and tried to hide behind each other in the showers which were visible from the door...teacher shooed them away but no sanctions), fire drill during PE...girls all lined up in very short gym skirts, boys openly leering, some laughing/catcalling/making suggestive remarks (nobody challenged them). It wasn't the worst environment but the school allowed a level of harrassment to occur, girls didn't bother to report it and started to accept it as ""just life"", teachers saw it as ""teenage boys being teenage boys...who sometimes crossed an invisible line between ""acceptable"" and ""unacceptable"" sexual harassment.,These boys are now men. The boys who harassed, the boys who witnessed it happening and saw how normalised it was, how few consequences there were. Husbands and fathers, passing on this horrible culture to the next generation, making women's lives a misery.,Seems we are no further on than 40 years ago.",,
"I was 14, walking out the gates after school. Plenty of people were leaving + a group of 3 boys looked at me. They were only 11/12 but the main boy was >6ft and much larger than me. One of them pointed at me and said to him: 'yeah, her'. He said 'wanna fuck?' I tried to ignore him and walked past. He followed me for a few steps, and then grabbed my ass. I turned my head around and they said 'ooooh someone's angry'. I had to ignore it and walk home, and tell my friends to walk a different way. I reported it to my Head of year- they'd received similar reports for the same boy + ""something would be done"". I don't know what. I kept seeing him and was scared to walk in school by myself. The worst part has been feeling like I don't deserve to be upset by it. He was obviously joking, and so it wasn't genuine sexual assault because I'm *too ugly for that*.",,
"During class, I was sat next to two boys. They both were touching my waist and thighs during said class.",,
"I can't remember what year I was in (I think I was maybe 15-16) but the first time I was touched sexually without my consent was at school. We were on a trip abroad and I was sat next to one of my male friends on the coach. I was trying to sleep so I had headphones in and my eyes closed and I felt him touching my behind and hip really lightly. I thought I was imagining it or maybe his coat was brushing me so I moved and pretended to still be asleep. He moved away when I moved but his hand went straight back to stroking my body after I stopped. This went on until we had a rest stop and I pretended to 'wake up'. I was so scared while it was happening, I kept trying to pluck up the courage to just open my eyes and confront him but I was frozen I just couldn't. I was so sick at the thought that one of my friends would do that to me. I didnt tell anyone because I thought no one would believe me or he would say he didn't do it. I think this is the first time I am talking about it.",,
"I was 11, it was my first day of year 7. I was on my way home when one of the older boys took advantage of me. I didn’t want to do anything or even go near the boy, i said no but he didn’t care. It ruined my life. It made me suicidal at the age of 11.",,
"I had my bum groped aggressively while queueing up for a lesson. I was 12, I think the guy who groped me was 11. I was too scared to say anything because a previous physical assault had been dismissed as 'just boys being boys' and I was told to suck it up. The boy left bruises from how tightly he gripped my bum.",,
Multiple sexual assault accounts,,
dated a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and it was going well till i started to realise all he really wanted was sex he would get angry and annoyed with me if we saw each other and nothing happened he would make comments about how he wouldn’t wank for a week just so he could fuck me multiple times and times where i would be uncomfortable with things or tell him to stop he wouldn’t and would continue telling me later that i wanted it and i was into it when i wasn’t,,
i was sexually assaulted in my history class by this girl who liked me. She tried to cover things up by saying “oh it’s just what friends do” while i sit in shock. I ran out of class to the bathroom and started crying.,,
I was laying there in bed when he pulled my pants down. Before I knew what was happening he had already begun sexually assaulting me. When he was done he packed his stuff and left me there. He didn’t go to my school tho….he was my father.,,
"When I was maybe 12 or 13 a boy who I had never met but had mutual friends with me pressured me to send him nude photos over BBM. He was extremely persistent and would not stop, so I sent him one to shut him up. Weeks later he started threatening me with them, telling him to send him more or he would spread it around. I can’t remember if I even did. Fast forward 7 years later and he was two years above me at university. He was in one of the biggest secret societies and in an extremely popular friendship group. Seeing him living his life and being so popular brought back the memories of this incident that I had repressed. He even tried to message me and ask how I was getting on, and once screamed my name as I entered a party. It felt like a power/humiliation thing",,
I was walking up these stairs after recess and a boy walking behind me grabbed my butt. I was only 10. I wish that I knew how wrong it was back then and I wish I got more justice.,,
"I was sexually assaulted by a boy in my year and he has done it to so many other girls in the school and continues to do it, he is also the son of one of the teachers in the school.",,
in middle school random guys would grab my boobs or ass and it happened multiple times even though i told them to stop,,
"i have been touched inappropriately, catcalled, spoken about inappropriately and more.",,
I liked him for so so long we would sext but he would never speak to me in school he wouldn’t even look at me then one day I saw on his laptop that he had taken a picture of my nudes using photo booth. I confronted him about it and told him I wasn’t mad I just wanted him to delete them and he lied to my face. The same boy has done other stuff that I’m not ready to publicly talk about but he used my feelings for him to his advantage and it’s taken me so long to trust anyone again.,,
"I once worked at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] (an amusement park in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]) and was subjected to sexual harassment. I started when I was sixteen and was told by co-workers that I was hot, attractive, and they would mention how ""badly"" they wanted to get with me. A lot of these men were over 18, and made me feel extremely uncomfortable as they would say these things in the staff room so I could not leave, and the workplace had a lot more men working than women so it made things much worse. Some of them found my social media and sent me messages that were explicit. One of them was 22 when I was 16 and described how he would have sex with me (literally how he would rape me). One time at work my pants ripped (I bent weirdly and they were tight and shitty material). Fortunately I was near the change room, however my whole bottom was exposed as well as my underwear barely covering my genitals. I exclaimed to one of the female co workers who was using the change room that my pants ripped and I needed to get in there as soon as possible, and unfortunately for me one of the men heard and everyone wanted to see how my pants ripped. I was able to cover myself before any of them saw, but the excitement of men over 20 to see a teenage girls butt and genitalia was disgusting and ended up being the reason I quit. Not to mention the supervisors would also attempt to flirt with me and did not care much about what was going on.",,
Had a boy i was friends with pretend to help me walk on new year’s eve so he could put his hands down my trousers. he knew i was too fucked to even speak.,,
Me and my closest best friend were sexually harassed by two boys at the age of 9. He used to be our friend. We told a teacher and she just said that she didn't't believe us. I told my parents and they took me out of school until the matter was resolved and then they never spoke about it again. It's been almost seven years.,,
"my mum and i had just been to see a concert at the [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], when we were going back to the local hotel there this man was hanging outside, he was leering at us. We went into the hotel lobby and wondered about it for a bit looking at some snacks that were on display and wondering if we should pop into the bar for a drink. But the queue was so long that we decided to go back up to our room for a cuppa instead, it was late anyway. The man saw his opportunity and as the lift was about to close he came into the lift he was freaky, i knew that he was going to try it on so i quickly pressed the lift door and said loudly oh I forgot something come on mum. So we went back out to the lobby and went to the bar area, the man came out of the lift to and went back to standing outside. When he was gone we went back to our rooms but we took the stairs instead. if ever we go to a hotel again i am going to bring a personal alarm too.",,
"The first time me and my boyfriend at the time had sex. i wasn’t ready at all. he was refusing to buy a condom and i had no access to any morning after pills. i told him i was uncomfortable with it but he didn’t care. he forced himself on me. once we’d finished he decided to cum inside of me and i had pregnancy scares for 3 months. fortunately, i wasn’t pregnant, but i’m still traumatised by that night and i’ve never been able to think of sex the same way. the thought of being intimate with someone scares me and i flinch every time someone moves. he ruined my life,",,
"he touched me and used his sexuality as an excuse of his actions. he had done much more to more than just me, we decided to speak up about it and go to teachers. he got nothing as a punishment, it was brushed under the carpet.",,
"when i was 13 , i had been touched against my will , getting groped in places that i had never been touched before, legs every so often getting spread by the man who touched me and rubbed my inner thigh. it makes me truly sick, that this was one of my best friends dad. it makes me sick that I didn’t know back then that was what was really happening.",,
"I was in a music class. The boy i sat next to rubbed my thigh and continuously rubbed my leg and my back. I was in a relationship two times he did this, and once when i was not. I told the school twice and the first time made out that it was my fault, and i was just scared that i cheated. I did not want it. The second time i told a teacher they said the next time he did this the police would get involved, but theres no point telling them anymore as im almost certain they wouldnt do anything. He has also done this to many many girls. I’d say around 20-30.",,
"I was 16, sleeping in a tent with my friends, this boy kept moving next to me. I felt uncomfortable even though I was lying next to my best friend. He put his arm around my neck and was pressing in, I was struggling to breathe. He put his hands in my pants and I kept trying, and failing, to move it away. He kept trying to have sex and push my head onto his dick, I didn’t want to wake anyone up as it would be too awkward. I really didn’t want to have sex with him so instead sucked his dick, which I still feel disgusting about. Moved to an empty tent as soon as he was finished because then I didn’t think he would follow me and try have sex.",,
in year 8 i was dating this guy and i constantly felt like i was being peer pressured into doing things and sending him things. he touched me in many ways even though i may not have felt comfortable and even told him that. he would beg me for nudes until i gave into the peer pressure. i gave into a lot of things that i regret and he would spread rumors about the things that happened between us. people now think awful of me and i regret everything that happened but im sure all of this will just make me stronger.,,
"Girls at my school were friends with boys who stalked and raped me and just found it funny. Even the girls who seem nice and serious get involved with slut shaming, it’s literally everyone. I’m not even worried about getting raped again, I’m worried if it happens girls are going to go on a weird rampage making it out like I’m the bad person. The bullying and harassment is definitely not just the boys.",,
I was 12 and two guys in class we're touching my body up and down even when I told them to stop the teacher said nothing and neither did anyone else another thing that happened was this girl repeatedly trying to kiss my lips/cheeks/neck/and even my thighs I told my teacher and alll she did was tell her to stop she didn't,,
"I was 14 and coming home from some sports training on the tube. i was walking from the platform to the gates when this guy whistled at me and started talking to me. he said i had the best legs he had ever seen and was asking where i live. i was really uncomfortable, but i just smiled and laughed and kind of gave vague answers. then i told him i was 14, since he looked at least 30. i got really lucky, cos this women came up and saw us and took me away from him. he started yelling at us, things like “you fucking bitches” and got really angry. the last thing i heard him scream at me was “you may be 14 but you’ve got the pussy of a 22 year old”. i don’t know what would’ve happened if that lady hadn’t come and gotten me out.",,
"A female student sexually assaulted me in the Girl's PE Changing Rooms when I was in Year 8. She wanted to ""compare boob sizes"", I said no. She touched my boobs anyway without my consent. I told this to a teacher who said ""she's just joking around"".",,
another student masturbated towards me on the bus and the school did nothing to teach the student that it was wrong or keep them separate from me/keep me safe,,
"I was in year 9 when it all started. There was a guy in the year above me that was trying to get to know me and at first I went along with it and things were good. But then things started to get sexual and at first I was happy but over time he started to force himself onto me. He’d tell me to meet him before school and would continuously force himself onto me even after I told him to stop. I finally built up the courage to tell a friend who didn’t believe me and started to spread rumours and lies about me and this went on for a year, until my parents found out but were under the impression that it was consensual. Once the teachers got involved they told me that the guy would never do anything like that once I told them the truth and they said that I could get done for character defamation. It got to a point where all my friends left me and everyone at school were bullying me and the teachers just stood there and watched. I was in the same form group as him and a few girls said that they believed me and proceeded to call him names (all of which I was not a part of) the guy then got angry and threw a chair at me. The same teacher who told me to stop spreading lies put me in isolation because apparently it was my fault. This truth never came to light and the teachers didn’t respect me at all. They essentially told me that me becoming isolated was my fault because I was “the girl who cried rape”. The teachers refused to help me or guide me in any way and till this date the guy finds different means of communication to tell me how he’s depressed and how he deserves it and tries to gain sympathy from me",,
"[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys push themselves on girls and are so so desperate to do anything with them, and as soon as the girl doesn’t want to and it is clear to the boy, either they will just sexually assualt them or wait until they are drunk and decide to try again and take advantage of us, or now they have decided because that girl didn’t want to sleep with them, they are now ugly, or fat, or a slut",,
"At fourteen I got my nudes sent around by a boy at my school. Not a month later I went to a party and was really drunk and a boy fully took advantage of me. We had sex even though I never said yes and I too scared that I would upset him if I said no. I have a lot of guilt about it because he wasn’t a bad guy but I felt so broken afterward. Immediately after it happened I found a friend and broke down crying because I knew everyone would find out and think I was a slut. I dated him for a few months afterward so people wouldn’t call me a slut or easy. It was so shit. I can’t call it rape but I can say that the rape culture at our school, particularly the toxic environment between GIRLS is what made me feel so trapped. I lost my virginity in the exact way I dreaded that I would and felt so scared about the social repercussions that I never did anything about it and pretended it was all fine for over a year. I knew if I didn’t date him then I would immediately be branded as a slut. I wish I would have had a stronger support network to feel like I could say it as it was without the fear of being judged. THE CONCEPT OF VIRGINITY SUCKS AND IT RUINED MY SELF ESTEEM BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS WEAK FOR LETTING IT HAPPEN TO ME.",,
I was raped by a boy who was [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] alumni whilst at uni and he kept whispering ‘I’m sorry’ into my ear as he did it. I lay motionless because my last attempt to get him to stop was to pretend I had blacked out after repeatedly saying no and holding my clothes to stop him from removing them.,,
The boys in our school and other schools in our area will rate us on a scale of 1-10 on how much they would like to rape us and have sex with us . This is considered normal in our school and all of the girls who I know have had this done to them. We all have been stared at inappropriately and had boys try to look down out skirts or touch us inappropriately,,
A girl repeatedly grabbed my bum around school and in class once shoved her hands down my pants and squeezed my balls whilst her friends laughed.,,
This guy I had spoken to for a little while came over to mine. Later that evening he started to make a move on me. He very shortly after that stood infront of me with his dick out expecting me to suck him off. Whilst this happened he was choking me quite hardly and slapped me and called me names. I was very shocked and uncomfortable by this especially as my parents were next door. I never directly told him to stop because I didn’t realise how wrong this was. I thought that maybe this was normal and that I should’ve enjoyed it. This happened and few times after this and he would never ask for consent to do anything or ask if I was ok. I didn’t seem to think much of it I jus thought I would become used to it. After we stopped talking I was made to feel guilty that I made that choice being told that he harmed himself on multiple times because of it. Only recently do I realise how messed up it was. I felt like because I never told him to stop I couldn’t blame him for any of it. I was so uncomfortable with everything that went on. I didn’t want to tell anyone because I thought I was overreacting but it has caused me a lot of stress to think that I thought it was ok for someone to treat me like that. At 16yrs old no girl should think that this is what a relationship should look like.,,
a boy in my year told me he jerked off to my instagram picture. i didn’t realise that it wasn’t okay until after and then continued saying he wanted to have sex with me.,,
I felt assaulted and harassed,,
"I was 15 and was at home with my cousin and his best friend, they were a few years older and I had always fancied his friend. We had been drinking and being younger and trying to keep up with two older boys I got really drunk. I went to bed and pretty much passed out, still with my clothes on. I woke up to the friend taking off my pants, when I began to move and try to get away he held me by my wrists and I froze. I could’ve shouted or kept kicking but I just froze. I was terrified, crying and saying no to him but he kept going. He left after raping me. I was bleeding and the next morning covered in black bruises all up the inside of my legs and on my wrists. I hid it all from my parents and cousin because I didn’t want everyone to know. Even though I fancied him, even though I was drunk, even though I was wearing small shorts, I never asked for it. This was how I lost my virginity.",,
I was sitting on the bus in year 8 and i was coming home from my friends. It was dark and in the winter time there were no seats left so i had to sit next this guy. I was wearing a short dress with tights and he kept looking at my legs i tried to get up but he kept watching me. I eventually got off the bus and he got off and started catcalling me i ran back home in fear. He wasn’t even that old probably in his late 20’s.,,
Me and my friends received explicit images some boys started stalking me and tried touching us in a number of places,,
I was walking home from school when slurs were shouted at me but a group of boys,,

I reported him to the police , they did not charge him as they felt I would ""have him back"" I did not. 33yrs.,Partners friend grabbed my behind and winked at me, just as my partner went to buy drinks. 34yrs.,Whilst at a job I was sexually harassed by a male member of staff in a full office, all male, when I reported it they all denied it. 42yrs.,Internet dating - multiple men blocked for inappropriate language, insulting behaviour, requests for sexual images and sending inappropriate images.,This feels like an ongoing barrage that will not end, and this list does not include inappropriate comments, everyday sexism, lack of access to equal pay and opportunities. I have always known these things and I do not believe these people are capable of change, either the perpetrators, institutions or the police. I have stopped being hopeful. My mental health has been terrible at times, I have found it hard to function. Despite this I have earned a degree (1st), a Masters and a Doctorate - these men did not win.,I have also met many, many lovely men and had the privilege of great family male role models, for this I am grateful because after all these examples you need something to hold on to.",,
"i was sexually abused a year ago, i recently moved schools to get away from my abuser. after a while of being at this school many boys had been commenting on my body. they also said ‘i’m going to rape you’ on my first day. one of these incidents involved a boy saying i have a fat ass, i shouted at him that this was inappropriate and rude. a male teacher then told me to watch my audience because i was the rude one in this situation.",,
"For 3 years straight, my whole middle school experience, I cannot think of a day where i was NOT touched inappropriately by two males I considered my friends. All three years, every single day, and even after graduating, they both found a way to do it one more time.",,
"I went on a date with a guy I liked. We had a lot of fun, drank quite a lot. I agreed to go back to his place and we ended up in his bedroom. I don’t remember much after that apart from waking up to find him doing something to me. And then waking up the next morning covered in marks on my neck. I felt weird. Not a usual hangover. I kind of put it down to a one night stand, like, this stuff happens all the time. Then a few weeks later I told someone who also knew him what had happened. She said he’d done the same to her friend but the friend realised what was happening and got away. I realised he spiked my drinks or drugged me then raped me whilst I was unconscious. 20 years later and it’s really messed me up and I now struggle to be intimate with my husband. I have anxiety and I don’t like being ‘manhandled’ or touched too much, even by my beautiful little children.",,
My step brother. He held a gun to me. Told me to get down on my knees and suck. He's held me in a room. He's made me cry. He's held me in a shed. He's mentally abused me. Made me think its my fault.,,
i was 12 y/o ..why did he raped me?..,,
About 16 years old leaving a house party. A boy I considered a friend leant down and hugged me goodbye. As he hugged me he lifted up my skirt and groped me revealing my underwear to all his friends standing behind me.,,
"I was 4 years old when i was molested by m uncle from my dads side, it happened 4 times, i don't remember the 4th time anymore but when i remember the other times i feel sick and disgusted, i feel like i didn't get justice, my uncle didn't get sentenced as the psychiatrist said that hes mind age is younger than hes actual age so he was mentally ill, i was 4 and he was 14/15/16 (i can't remember), it dosent matter if in hes mind he wasn't his actual age je still molested me and i got no justice, just trauma and pain. I talk to him these days now, and i try to put aside what he did as hes mentally ill and i feel bad, but that's no excuse but i still use it as one",,
"When I was about 18 I went to a huge country ball with my sister, we were on a table with some adult family friends and there was dancing afterwards. I was probably the youngest there. One of the adults, a married man and father who had known my parents for years, kept dancing provocatively with me, my sister and some of my friends and younger women at the party. He put his hand round my waste and grabbed me so that our faces were nearly touching. I tried to push away but he was much stronger and then he grabbed my hand and rubbed it against his crotch and pulled me harder in. I managed to stamp on his foot and get away and when I looked up all of the other adults on the dance floor, including his wife, were giving me dirty looks and saying that my sister and I were being slutty on the dance floor and tempting him. We both left the party feeling dirty and ashamed. When I told my dad the next day he was shocked and disgusted but did nothing about it and never confronted any of the people involved.",,
"He groped me, i said no. That’s all i want to share..",,
"I was in a new relationship with a guy in my year in sixth form. It started at the start of study leave so we didn't have too much time together, but the first time we were alone he pushed my head and forced it down to give him head. I kept telling him I didn't want to and that I wasn't ready yet, but he used both hands to place my head down there. He could tell I was crying but held my head in place until he finished. I confided in my friends who told me he was such a nice guy and they didn't think he would do that to me. For some reason I rationalised it as a one off, taking my friends' judgements of him to be true. A month later he got drunk and hit me, shoved me against a wall so hard I fell. Luckily, this time it was in front of some of my friends who kicked him out of the house, one of them even drove him home to make sure he didn't loiter outside. That was the end of that relationship but I should have ended it in the first instance.",,
"It was [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and we were at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and it was too dark to find my tent, so I went and found my friends and asked if I could stay in one of their tents. It was all boys, but we’d been friends for years so I trusted them. The boy who’s tent I ended up staying in was a boy I’d got with once before...I started falling asleep and as I was, my ‘friend’ started groping my breasts and putting his hand in my underwear. I pretended to be asleep while he touched me. The next morning I told my friends and they kept me away from him for the rest of the festival. People I know now know this story and remain friends with him.",,
"it was me and my friend , both girls, sneaking out to some church for a boy that she liked. idk i guess i was just there for support or bc i spent the night but anyways as they were making out i was chillin on the side walk and i was wearing loose shorts and a big hoodie and he stuck his hand in my shorts and started doing it, i tried walking away or kind of scooting back but non chalantly because i didn’t want my friend to get hurt. and she’s like that too, even if it was rape i’d still get the blame put on me so i stayed quiet because number one why would i want to get in trouble for sneaking out and then possibly getting in trouble for being sexually assaulted.",,
Me and my friends had a heavy night and plans fell through. With no where to stay I went back to this boys house. 2 taxis full of people I didn’t really know and I felt quite awkward and intimidated. The house was so full. I had work very early the next morning. The boy harassed me for 4 hours and then raped me. My alarm to go to work went off midway through and I ran. I still remember how my vagina hurt through the whole shift the next day,,
"i was 13 and had just moved to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] for my dad’s job. I had to say goodbye to the friends I had known for practically my whole life. I only really had 3 or 4 girl friends and the rest were guys. One was my best friend and I’d had feelings for him for a while. When i moved he told me he felt the same. I was really happy and we started getting more flirty. He asked me to send him nudes and i didn’t want to so i said no. he kept asking and asking and he made me feel really uncomfortable. He started making comments about my body saying what he’d do with me if I came over to visit. When I turned 14 after a few months I gave in and sent him my boobs and my bum. he screen shotted them and sent them to my other guy friends telling them what I’d done. He didn’t speak to me afterwards and the boys I thought were my friends started to blackmail me into sending to them. One of them said they’d kill themselves if I didn’t do it. It’s been over a year since it happened and I still can’t get over the fact that I was used for my body by my best friend and I feel like it’s my fault. He’s made me not want to get close to boys i fancy in case it happens again. It’s not as bad as some of the other stories on here, but i think there needs to be more education that pressuring someone until they say yes is not consent and it shouldn’t be normalised.",,
"I was at a party when I was 14 and went out into an alley way to smoke (because I couldn't smoke in the house). A boy followed me, asked me for a cigarette as I reached to give him one, pushed me against the wall and started touching me. He was a huge ""gym lad"" and I am so thankful I was sober enough to knee his groin and burn his hand (with which was pinning me to the wall) with the cigarette I was holding. This boy has a reputation of assaulting girls. I saw him telling his mates later and they laughed.",,
"When I was 11 there was a guy I liked and he took advantage of that and took me to his house with his friends and forced me to do uncomfortable stuff that I didn’t consent too, handjobs etc I was that scared about what happened I didn’t leave my house for 1 month. After 4 years I found out that he’s done the same to other girls.",,
"In 8th grade a kid ran up to me, grabbed my breasts, and squeezed. I was too embarrassed to say anything so he never got in trouble.",,
"In Year 8, a boy went around a rubbing his hands up and down our backs to see if we were wearing bras. The girls that weren’t were ridiculed. We were 12 at the time.",,
was forced into sexual acts by boys at school,,
"In our secondary school, it was commonplace to share a girls nudes with your guys mates in a collection. It was only really found out in year 11 when they didnt really care that people knew. All sorts of harrassment would happen within school and outside of school from the boys not caring about consequences. Luckily i was on the larger side so i was left alone but girls would always wear clothes too big for them so that guys couldnt look, but pe was the worst. In the bleep test, we were lined up in lines of boys and lines of girls and the guys would take the advantage to look at our bums for like 10 minutes.",,
I was sexually assaulted several times at the age of about 7 by a boy 2-3 years older than me. I have never told anyone about it and just pretend it never happened. Its always there at the back of my mind though.,,
"I was in a long term relationship, I was having sex with my (now ex) boyfriend and it hurt. I started violently sobbing and he wouldn’t stop.",,
I was kidnapped and raped at 5. when I told my boyfriend this at the time (in year 11) he told me to not worry about it and how it was in the passed and then continued into pressuring me to have sex with him. he cheated on me and we broke up.,,
"I’m 15 (girl, london) and I feel asleep on my train for 10 minutes. I wake up to a man sitting next to me and my top and hoody pulled down to my waist, he hurriedly walks off the train when I wake up. It was obvious he had been touching me and i was crying on the train. A man was sat opposite on the other side and he said nothing to me. I called transport police and was shocked to find that although I was a minor and they are meant to have cameras in every carriage, the cctv footage “was not available” and gave me Samaritans helpline number instead. I was disgusted by not only the behaviour of the two men who were on my train, but also by the lack of precautions that the police have put up on London’s transport.",,
I was talking to a boy over snapchat thinking he was nice and it was just banter and chat but gradually he forced the conversation into more and more sexual things. He tried to pressure me into sending him nudes telling me he couldn’t meet me in person until he “saw what was underneath” my clothes. He would also say things like he would only fuck me if he got something material in return making me feel worthless. eventually i tried to stand up for myself and told him it was inappropriate and he responded with more sexual messages so i had to block him on all socials.,,
"I was talking to a guy in my own year and the other lads saw that as a challenge, but one guy who took my bus back and lived locally would take it to far. He would touch me and grab me inappropriately seeking praises from his peers, which he indeed got. In my final week of school -one day- he stalked me as I made my way home, and on the last stretch towards my house he caught up and stopped me. I was dragged into the corner of a field where nobody could hear me shout for help. It was there when he pinned me down and raped me. I couldn’t do anything to stop him, as much as a said no and tried pushing him off, nothing worked. There was nothing I could have done. But he walked away thinking his actions were fine because sexual abuse has been so normalised it means nothing, this is why many including myself find it hard to come forward. This sort of behaviour is traumatising and not okay.",,
thinking back to my earlier years in secondary school and I’m just now realising how unacceptable boys behaviour was yet it was normalised to the point where I felt I couldn’t say anything about it? like in year 8 in a science lesson we sat on stools with holes in the middle and I was sat with some boys at the back. we were just chatting when one of the boys put his foot through the hole in my seat and pushed it onto my vagina. he quickly took it off acting all shocked and then said ‘haha ur first experience of penetration’ him and his friends then proceeded to all laugh. even if he accidentally done it his reaction and what he did afterwards instead of apologising made me feel so embarrassed and uncomfortable as I was only 11/12 years old.,,
"This is my second seperate testimony on here. I was raped by a man I liked and used to work with. I liked him for a year, but went off him and he realised I had gone off the idea. One night he dropped me to hotel after work that I was staying at, and we kissed in the car. I was very drunk as three of us had been in a pub all evening. I stumbled out of the car and he followed me, and I fell down on the steps of the hotel and managed to stumble into my room. He followed me. I automatically took my clothes off and fell into bed drunk and he got on top of me and raped me. He was still there the next morning. I felt very uncomfortable and he left. He came back at lunchtime to drop me to the station and said sorry. I was in shock. I didnt't report it to the police and had'nt even considered it as an option. I texted him that night and told him he had taken advantage of me. He said he hadn't and would not disrespect me like that, but as he had already said sorry I knew he knew different. I never spoke to him again. I told the other guy we were out for drinks with that night and he said it was all down to the drink. The funny thing is, my instinct told me that there was something dark about him but I ignored it because I lilked him,/fancied him. I was right all along and wish I had taken it further. I feel so angry towards him.",,
"I had invited friends over and at the last minute the girls I invited dropped out. I had 4/5 boys over at my house. I remember smoking a cigarette out a window and my “friend” pressing himself against my ass. I was trapped leaning out the window, terrified. I asked him to stop but he was laughing about it and asked if I had been working out recently. None of the other boys said or did anything to stop it.",,
"I’m a male and when I was fourteen about to be fifteen I went to a small drinking party with some people I thought I trusted, a girl there had broken up with her boyfriend there because the relationship was toxic and she wanted to find a way to get over it. She was constantly giving me drinks, at the time I didn’t see that as a red flag I just thought she was being nice, but as time went by and I became blackout drunk she started trying to take my pants off, this was still in the room with the people, by this time it was dark as people were trying to sleep. I had tried to stop her but I couldn’t since I was weakened by the alcohol, by this point I couldn’t remember much, but I vividly remember her managing to to have sex with me while she was completely sober, I have never gone to the police or told almost anyone as i wouldn’t be taken seriously as at the time I was 6’2 and she was 5’0.",,
I was in primary school when a boy indecently touched me and i felt disgusted and to this day i still have to live with it.,,
"I was just about 16 when I met him. The day we started talking my parents had told me they were getting divorced so I was vulnerable and seeking a change. I had heard of him before and how he had abused a friend in the past (I did not know the extent back then) and he was charming and sweet to me. He had just turned 18. We quickly bonded over our love for music and our traumatic pasts, as we both suffered from PTSD and dissociative disorders. I lived in another country at the time but we began an online friendship that was questionable from the start. He was a drug addict and I was still heavily drinking at the time and dealing with unresolved trauma. He would randomly text and call me and not leave me alone, or would not reply for days and keep me worried. Then he started a band and added me to it even though I lived far away. From there it got worse as he would always tell me I’m the reason he’s getting sober (he did for a while but then started lying about it) and that I was his only reason for living. I knew this was not right and would not end well but since I had shared my trauma with him and he made me feel understood I stayed. My whole friendship with him I also had a boyfriend (who I’m still with) but the guy would threaten him and try turn me against him, trying to convince me that my boyfriend was assaulting and abusing me and that I should run away. He began saying that I needed to call him every night at ridiculous hours else he would kill himself and I had to tell him how much I loved him and was attracted to him. He made me get used to him calling me sexual nicknames even though I was uncomfortable with them for multiple reasons. I was getting drunk often and struggling in my own relationship and he would make me apologise to him by talking dirty and confessing undying love. When I began to get increasingly uncomfortable he would blame it on his Dissociative Identify Disorder and would not take accountability. He started saying I was the delusional one and I was the one forcing sexual and romantic conversations. When we met, I felt safe for a while but was somehow on edge. People all around me warned about him but I still didn’t cut off all contact. He began making out with me on multiple occasions after I was drunk or struggling with dissociative episodes and would after tell me that I enjoyed it and I was the one keeping him alive and sane. I felt filthy but kept our friendship out of fear he would contact my boyfriend and protreay me in a bad light. This continued for half a year and I was still in a band with him. I tried to leave the band many times but each time he threatened suicide, yet he was constantly blocking me when I tried holding him accountable or telling him he was wrong in a situation. He would send me pictures of himself self harming, and pictures of his ex girlfriends (past victims actually) tied up sexually. He said he would only stop it I replied with adoring or sexual messages . I started to believe I was going insane and it was my fault and becoming increasingly unstable and living in fear in every aspect of my life. [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I had an argument with him and he blocked me yet again and I was finally done and wanted nothing with him again. He knew this and resorted to texting my boyfriend, and accused me of cheating and forcing myself on the dickhead and that I was lying about everything and that I was psychotic and stalking him, trying to make him jealous. The opposite was true and I was living in fear whenever I entered the UK, which was at least once a month. I resolved things with by boyfriend as I had collected so much evidence of the abuse I suffered at his hands and my boyfriend trusted me. Everyone around me knew how I was being used and at the end backed me up against him. I’ve been avoiding all contact with him since then, yet he still finds new ways to contact or follow me and my friends, especially now we are both involved in the [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] music scene. I’ve been telling people around me who may know him to look out. I know many other of his victims who suffered more real life abuse than me. It was not my fault",,
"during a practical session on wednesday, several older men were leading the demonstration. they kept putting their arms around me and their hands on my lower back. i went home and cried, because i hate being touched like that.",,
"I am sad that this is still a problem. My testimony: date raped at 17, I was a virgin. This experience coloured my relationships for years and meant that I felt that anyone wanting a relationship with me was just after six. Ten years later, I was kerb- crawled on my way home.The guy got a shock when I used my keys, thrusting them at his face and shouting f*** off. Shortly after that a man exposed himself to me on a Sunday afternoon. He didn't touch me but I felt violated. When I went home, my housemates laughed. I felt dirty. Had a weekend job and a (male) colleague grabbed my behind. Fortunately, the (female) manager dealt with it well, immediately. I'm okay now, with a loving partner, but when I look back at what I experienced, I fear for other women. I don't think there is enough support and young men definitely need to be educated. There is still a "" she was asking for it"" culture. NO SHE WASN'T",,
Slept at a boys during freshers. We didnt have sex because I didnt want to we just kissed for a bit and then I fell asleep at his because it was late and I was really drunk. Woke up in the middle of the night with him on top of me choking me. I honestly didnt even realise it was wrong until months later and just kind of pretended it didnt happen because it was one of my first sexual experiences and he was one of the “cool” guys on campus that all the girls liked so who was I to not want to sleep with him?,,
"I was raped by a friend whilst studying abroad in the US. I had turned him down before, I was very drunk, had fallen on my face and was bleeding from big cuts down my mouth and chin. He told our other friends he would take care of me and clean me up. Woke up next day still with dirt in the cuts, I didn’t remember what happened, just saw him there and the condom, I felt sick. My next door roommate asked me if I was okay, she heard me crying loudly late at night but didn’t come in because she heard his voice and knew we were friends. He told me he barely remembered what had happened so I pretended everything was fine thinking well if neither of us remember then I guess it wasn't his fault. But later I found out he had bragged to others in specific detail. I laughed it off, I was scared people would think I was lying out of regret because I had a reputation for getting very drunk. After this happened I started drinking very heavily.",,
"I was in year 8 he was in year 10. He was friends with lots of my friends and friendly enough with a dirty sense of humour - relatively innocent and as a young girl a guy fancying you is massive validation. After a while my friend and I messaged him pretending to meet up for sex, I stood him up as I didn’t actually want to but he went to the meeting place comfortable with the idea of sleeping with a 12/13 year old. For months after this he made inappropriate comments and would grab at me and try to pull me onto his lap. I kept silent for 5 years because I believed it was my fault for giving him the idea even after it was obvious I was incredibly uncomfortable. I realise now I was a victim of sexual harassment and low level assault but I didn’t know nor did I know to say anything.",,
I was walking home from school when I was 10 years old it was winter and I was taking a regular short cut. When a middle age man forced me to give him oral sex and then raped me down an alley way,,
In first year of high school there was a boy in my class who regularly used to grope a friend and I. I remember him touching me without permission and threatening to tell everyone I had my period if I told anyone. I was very embarrassed and he kept saying I had a secret. It lasted for about a year. I was very embarrassed about it and didn't want to cause any problems so didn't tell anyone. I used to scoff when I heard of people reporting much less serious things.,,
"I was 13, and this boy sat next to me in class. Outside of school he would constantly beg me to meet him and send him nudes and inside school during the lesson he would touch me. It started with his leg resting on mine but as we went on his hands would move further and further up my thigh towards you know where. He would place his hands there are rub against it during a lesson. He could feel I was uncomfortable and would continue and ask me if I liked it even though I would try shut my legs. I'm now 16, and only yesterday when a teacher asked 'has anyone ever been assaulted' did it hit me that what he did wasn't right. I just remember that 13-year-old me was so ashamed and felt disgusting. I still wonder why I never spoke about it until now?",,
My boyfriend at the time was in a bad mood with me before going to bed one night. He was purposely turning away and wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. He then said he was in a bad mood because I hadn’t given him head for a while. I was mortified and came up with a bunch of bullshit excuses as to why I hadn’t even though it just hadn’t crossed my mind as I thought we were both content with the sexual side of our relationship . He said ‘If you know something makes me feel good why wouldn’t you want to do that?’ I ended up giving him head and then he was happy again. I went to bed next to him with tears trying to make sure he wouldn’t hear me crying. It’s something that I didn’t think much of at the time other than that I was embarassed and felt like I hadn’t ‘done my duty’ by not having given him head for a while. Looking back two or so years later I felt so sad that I hadn’t been honest about how upset it made me feel but instead tried to make sure he didn’t hear me cry,,
"At the school I went to, I was sexually assaulted more than once in the classroom while teachers were present. The first time was in year 9. I was in History when one of the boys i sat with at the back of the class kept trying to talk to me. I spoke back to him to be polite but he then started to touch my leg and he even grabbed my shirt and looked down it. Another time (this happened multiple times) was in my chemistry lessons. While the teacher was giving demonstrations and we would all gather round, a boy in my class would stand behind me and touch me and get so close to the point where I could feel his breath on my neck. All the boys would laugh at it but the teacher never noticed even though this happened in almost every lesson.",,
I was 17 and passed out on a strangers bed. I didn’t realise what happened to me was assault till 6 months after.,,
"When I was 13 I had already been through pubity, I was a child with a womans body. In school boys took advantage of this daily, groping me, rubbing there genitals on me and forcing themselves on me. They would describe sexaul acts they wanted to me to participate in and tell me of how they would touch themselves thinking of me. I felt so disgusted and ashamed and tried to hide my body whilst laughing it off each day. I reported it to the school they seems supportive at first and told me they would be devastated if it was there daughter. Then next day I was called out of class to be told nothing will be coming of it because it was provoked by me because the boys had been my friends and I encouraged them. I did not.They even called my Mum without my consent to tell her it was nothing and just a bit of fun.",,
"I was at a party and there was a boy who kept going around slapping all of the girls butts (he would come up behind us and do it before we noticed him or could stop him). His friends called him a ‘legend’ and cheered him on. After slapping one girl, he started laughing and said it ‘jiggled more than the others’ and then started fat-shaming her. Again, his friends laughed and cheered him on.",,
He was my best friend. He’d hosted a small party for 4 of us close friends and I stayed over at his after. We watched a movie after the others had left but fell asleep before it finished (in the same bed - we’d shared a bed before and we cuddle all the time but it had been fine before). I woke up early in the morning to his hands all over me and trying to rub me through my pyjamas. I was completely frozen pretending to be asleep because I couldn’t think what else to do. I told him to stop and he did. I confronted him about it the following day and told him never to touch me like that again. He apologised loads but tried to blame it on the alcohol (it happened at 6am). We’ve barely spoken since and I miss the friendship. I can’t help but blame myself for putting myself in that situation.,,
"He was my best friend and someone I trusted the most, even someone loved by my family. I went to his house one day because I was sad and he always made me feel better. We went to his room which wasn’t unusual but then he forced me under the covers, I was uncomfortable so I sat on my phone. He then took my phone out of my hands and went on top of me. Next thing I knew I was in the worst situation of my life. With many panic attacks to follow me for months on, people thinking I am being dramatic or adding on things that didn’t happen, even though there I am laying in a ball on my floor crying and shaking struggling to breathe.",,
I was 14 and we were at [location censored by EI to preserve anonymity] with millfield on a camp. I was taking a shower and boys proceed to bang on the doors and tell us to get out now or they were going to come in. They did this for a solid 5 minutes saying “ in 5 seconds I’m going to nock this door down and come in” there were about five of us in the shower cubicles and the school proceeded to say that it wasn’t there fault and they were exited dorm playing rugby in the heat.,,
Adults at the school were too hands on.. We were made to wear reveling clothes in performances with governors on the front rows.,,
"Last year I was over at a friends house and their family friend, a 50 year old piss drunk man, walked in. He claimed to know my parents and proceeded to talk to me. He cornered me in their living room getting really close to my face and breathing heavily. My friends were in the same room, both boys and girls, and they did nothing after I made faces at them and mouthed help. None of them did anything and I felt so uncomfortable. He spoke to me for around 30 mins. I tried to turn my body away in order to go and sit with the other people in the room but he kept moving to block me in. I had no way of getting out and no one came to help me.",,
"It was my second time sleeping with a [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys and he didnt ask any type of consent re finishing and just finished in me, no condom, didnt ask if it was ok or anything (the first time I told him I was on the pill and it was okay if he finished in me, but this was a month later and I was off it now). In the morning I had to go and get the morning after pill too. I felt really violated as although I knew this guy and got on with him well, there was a clear lack of respect and sense of entitlement that he can do what he wants and have no consequences. He then stayed over at mine and all night I felt so uncomfortable and assulted lying next to him in bed. I felt too scared to tell him he had crossed a line as he clearly saw nothing wrong with what he did and I didnt want to come across prudish. This needs to change. These boys need to realise they are not entitled to the world and everything in it and their actions have consequences. Not asking if its ok that he doesnt wear a condom, finishes in you, then doesnt check afterwards (and actually just falls asleep) just epitomises ego, entitlement and the lack of consequences this boy believes hes entitled to. its not ok.",,
I was groped multiple times at my school and while it wasn’t sexual assault it was sexual harassment one time it was my boyfriend at the time and he grabbed my boob in the corridor without my consent in front of a few people even teachers saw it and nobody did anything or said anything i was so traumatised i flinch when anyone tries to touch me because i get scared its gonna happen again and because he was my boyfriend i didn’t think much of it but we’re learning about sexual harassment in schools and it made me realise what happened was wrong and that just because he was my boyfriend he didn’t have the right to do it,,
"i was pinned to the floor and kissed without consent,as well as touched innapropriately. i had said no multiple times.i trusted him.",,
"one day i was meeting a boy with my friends and my friends left me alone and the boy we was meeting started getting all touchy feely with me so i walked away and sat somewhere else (whilst trying to get in touch of my friends) he came over and started to finger me i asked him to stop but he forced me down so i was unable to move and he then raped me, my mum called me and i took my phone and answered whilst crying my eyes out and my dad came to collect me. it was the worse thing i had ever been through and now i’m scared to go near any boy that i don’t know properly. but walking past him in school knowing everyday knowing he got away with it just breaks my heart💔",,
"I was sat in maths in year 10 (14 years old) and this guy sat next to me, who I knew since year 7 ) grabbed the inside of my leg and squeezed it really hard. I pulled him off but he proceeded to do it again but further up, underneath my skirt and when I told him to gtf off me he sat there and laughed. I had a massive bruise all down the inside of my left leg.",,
i was 13 when 3 boys one day started randomly grabbing my butt and one day when we were on the bus one boy grabs my butt from behind and another one grabs my breast from the front,,
I’m only 15 and i have been sexually assaulted and groped by at least 5 middle aged men and even though i had told my guy friends that they continue to make rape jokes and jokes about the me too movement. It frustrates me that some people don’t realise the impact these assaults have made on my life,,
"I’ve been in so many situations where being honest and saying no is being rude. And not wanting to have sex has turned into ‘ok fine’ (which was never yes) because I didn’t want to disappoint my partner. And being polite means staying quiet whilst letting people talk about you and sexualise you. I’ve been in so many situations where walking down the street means I have to look around me more. I have to feel self conscious about what I’m wearing , even if I really lloved that outfit that day I’d go out and feel like it was too revealing etc because people would stare. From a young age the experience of men honking their horns in their cars/vans on the way to and from school which is RIDICULOUS!! And as well pretty much most work sites where builders etc are working I’ve felt nervous as I’ve been catcalled many times. I’ve been in situations whilst being chatted up IVE apologised because I’m not as chatty as usual etc because I’ve tried to shake them off except it comes across as rude because they can’t get the hint. I’ve been told by guy friends and other girl mates to clarify where I stand with a guy because I flirted with him one time and he has a crush. But me not wanting to be with him means I have to clarify that otherwise any other advance he makes is justified. Countless times that I have been subjected to such behaviour. Which to be completely honest I never actually second guessed until this movement properly got more attention. Now I realise that my behaviour especially at night is actually modified around men and my ingrained fear of them.",,
"it was around 2pm and i went upstairs of the local library to study. the entire floor was just men, so i was already a bit anxious. the only seats i felt comfortable sitting at were at the computers, so i started taking my books out and i started hearing the guy (looked maybe early 30s) whom was sitting 2 seats away from me grunt. i brushed it off and started writing. i then kept hearing him grunting and it was so loud and breathy. i quickly glanced at him and then down at him pants and he had his hand in them. i shoved everything into my bag as quickly as i could and ran out of the library. i was sobbing all the way to costa and hid out in the toilet for at least 30 minutes to calm myself down.",,
I went to a party on Halloween in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with one of my friends. After an hour the hosts parents came home and everyone was kicked out. We were very drunk and my friend and I were left to wait on the streets until we could be picked up. A group of boys from the party then came over to us and one of them starting grabbing my ass. I wasn’t aware it was happening at first as I was so drunk but once I realised I moved away. None of his friends said anything.,,
A guy grabbed my butt and kissed my neck in the locker room while I told him to stop,,
"I was sexually assaulted at 14 at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in 2014-2015. I was walking up the main stairs in between floor 1&2 when I lad put his hand up my skirt 3 times whilst other people were behind him watching him. I froze and did nothing, it took me days to tell school. I finally told them and was told they would speak to my parents. 3 days went by and my parents didn’t get a call so I had to tell them. My parents rang school immediately and wanted to speak to who handled the situation. The teachers explanation as to why she never informed my parents of the sexual assault was ‘well she wasn’t crying when she told me so I didn’t think it was that big a deal and no one needs to really know’.",,
"I was coerced into things I didn't want to do when I was a freshman in college. It was things that no one would care about if I spoke up, since it ""wasn't actually r@pe"". It's a small university, so everyone knows everyone, and I saw (and still see) my abuser constantly. This is why I can never come forward.",,
"This story happened to me a couple years ago when I was a Sophomore in High School, freshly turned 16 in October. In December of the school year, I got a DM from some guy who went to school with us, a Senior, saying “hey”. Well we really hit it off, I enjoyed talking to him so much we spoke for hours because we shared many interests. I started to develop a crush and began to get really attached to him but he would never acknowledge me in school. Fast forward a month or so, he’s snapping me at his house with a friend, and they’re drinking. (I had admitted to liking him by this point, to which he said it will not work because of him going to college) He texts me that he loves me after a short conversation about music and I say it back, fully knowing I didn’t love him. I just felt confused because he shut any relationship down in weeks prior. But I still really liked him. Then he tells me the reason we can’t date is simply because I’m not popular enough. I told him things like that don’t matter. It’s tough for me to remember when things turned sexual, but he started asking me to send him nudes when he went to the bathroom. I said no, I’m not comfortable with that. I’ve never done anything remotely sexual before and I was still prudish at this age. He kept asking over and over, then he started send pics of him holding his privates, which I did not ask for at all. He said he loved me again. I took off my clothes, down to a bra and underwear and sent him a picture of me in the mirror. He said, not good enough, and began begging for me naked. I kept refusing until he started to get an attitude with me. So then I finally slid my underwear to my knees and took my bra off and sent him this pic. He said “yes baby” or something like that and I’m guessing pleasured himself. When he must’ve finished he basically ended the night there. The next morning he tried to act like he was too drunk to remember but I was quick to tell him- to which he feigned concern and guilt but never addressed it after that day. He just said he feels sick and then that was it. My friends who are no longer my friends now (and would probably consider themselves ‘woke’ today) victim shamed me, told me I should’ve blocked him and just never let it happen. Yes, I agree but people don’t understand the amount of manipulation, hope and confusion that these predators are able to conjure to make you do exactly what they want. I struggle with this violation to this day. It’s hard to talk about despite that fact that I want to tell this story. I wish I had never known this person, however I wish every else knew this persons true colors. I hope I’m his only coercive sexual experience and their aren’t other girls that have had their body’s boundaries violated.",,
"In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I was a freshman at a new school. I was assaulted by someone that the school told me to trust. J was a senior who was supposed to give me a ride home after a big school bonfire. On the way home, late at night he asked me to go to house and watch a movie. When I rejected it, he proceeded to drive until we reached a stoplight. He put a hand on my knee and when I moved away, crossed my legs and asked him to chill, he forced my legs open and assaulted me. While he assaulted me, he talked about my purity. He ripped my dress and left bruises on my hips. I didn’t talk about it and repressed it until late November when I felt like I had to tell someone. The school didn’t punish him, and implied I should apologize to him. Administration continued to ignore the issue as he continually harassed me and spread rumors about me. J got absolutely no punishment and I had to find my own closure. The rape culture in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is out of hand.",,
"I was in a club. It was a Wednesday night, I used to feel confident going clubbing on a Wednesday night. I didn’t used to be scared to get with someone because of what might happen after. I thought kissing someone was harmless. ,That evening, I wasn’t aware what had happened, I was too drunk to realise that what had occurred was definitely not consensual. I wasn’t really even aware when I first woke up, I even joked to a friend that I had been “fingered in a club and kind of sucked him off”. Later that day I realised there was no consent, I was too drunk and the actions were too forceful. I later told a friend that I couldn’t laugh about it and thinking about it was making me really upset. But she didn’t realise and later it was made a joke off, “Never have i ever...”. I never thought another girl would make such jokes, that was the lad culture that i so often condemned, not my friends. Sexual assault should not be a joke and to this day I don’t think I could get with someone in a club again without being scared what they could do to me.",,
It was my first real relationship and he pressured me into everything my first kiss my first intimate touching...loosing my virginity. I felt as if i couldn't say no,,
"Last year the male sports centre manager asked my friend who the lesbians were in our year, who was sleeping with who and made lewd inappropriate comments. Other staff were present and nobody said anything to defend her. Inappropriate comments and 'jokes' were common and text messages have been sent to girls making them feel uncomfortable. But there is a wall of silence.",,
I was at a simple kick back with my friends that I all knew very well. I didn’t drink at the time and I went upstairs to use the bathroom. Not even 2 seconds after I walked in one of my what I considered good friends walked in and locked the door. He immediately started trying to take all my clothes off and as a 5’4 girl I was genuinely not a match for this wasted kid who was about 6’1. It got to the point of me screaming for help as he held his hand over my mouth and continued to take my clothes off. Abs the rest well you can guess from it being read on here. But the worst part was seeing him at school on Monday and him not remembering anything besides the fact that he blacked out that night. To this day I’m too scared to even mention it to him because I don’t want to relive the hurt I went through.,,
"When I was in secondary school a lot of things happened that at the time I thought was normal, but now i look back and I am so angry. I remember multiple times male teachers approaching me when I was 13-15 saying that I was dressed inappropriately for school when I was wearing shorts (that were not tight or very short) and a t-shirt/vest (also not tight) because it was summer. I would always get sent home and it would always be male teachers telling me off, yet the boys were allowed to wear whatever they wanted. I remember vividly when asked why I was being sent home, the male teacher said it was because 'my armpits were inappropriate for school', which still baffles me to this day. Another time, a boy who had been trying to make advances at me when I was 14 was sat next to me in class and that made me nervous. During the lesson and in front of everyone he launched himself at me and tried to kiss and grope me, in front of the teacher and the class. I pushed him away which resulted in him stumbling back. Everyone was laughing and cheering him on, and he was smiling. The teacher sent BOTH of us out for disturbing the class. I was so upset and people made fun of me for weeks afterwards, whereas he was praised for being funny and daring. None of my friends said anything. Multiple times at this school boys followed me and my friends home, which made us all very nervous and our parents had to come out and intervene sometimes. When we eventually told a teacher, nothing happened.",,
"From a young age I have been shouted at my men in vans, beeped at and whistled at. Men would grab me on busses or in a club. The sad part is that this is normal.",,
i was 13 getting begged for nudes by someone in two years above me and he was begging to have sex with with me saying the people with big boobs are freaky in the sheets and did that the next year around the same time and the same for the next he only stopped when i actually got angry and shouted back and he told me i was psycho and a prude.,,
A girl once filmed us having sex without my knowledge and once I found out I made her delete it. A few days later she said she hadn’t and threatened to show people if I didn’t do what she said. We we’re very close so I never thought anything of it but looking back that has caused a lot of self confidence and trust issues in my life.,,
I remember I was drunk at my friends house with all my friends and one of them being really drunk picked me up kicked me and threw me on the ground and everyone brushed it off as normal and fine. This person has constantly ‘accidentally’ groped me whether I’m walking past or climbing over to get something and it always makes me feel sick that it’s just considered ‘normal’ and no conversations have ever been had with him.,,
"Lots of things have happened to friends/myself that are explicitly sexual harassment/assault (e.g. I’ve been stalked by a man masturbating abroad, who chased me/a group of friends round streets in Spain) but one thing that stays with me is far more subtle and something that I can’t really talk about with anyone because I’m still friends with the guy, and it’s a “grey area”. At university, I had a huge crush on someone in my halls. They knew about it, but it was very clear that this wasn’t reciprocated. When we were both on a night out, I was very drunk and doing the classic thing of leaning up against him, making it easy for him to hug/kiss me if he wanted to. Being less drunk than me, he offered to take me back to my room, and we ended up in bed together, kissing. I don’t know if he was touching me (I don’t remember) but I know that I gave him a hand job. Later, I heard from a close friend that he’d revealed to her/other friends one night that he’d “taken advantage” of me and felt bad about it. Weirdly, that confession (which only one friend talked to me about) made me feel more worse than the act itself. I wonder if he ever thinks back to what happened, and I wonder why he chose to tell people that about himself - was it a desire to “impress”? Assuage guilt? I also find it a bit violating that friends knew that about me and didn’t broach the subject - it feels like a weird power dynamic and like they sort of condoned what happened in silence.",,
"I was going on the bus to visit my friend after someone in her family passed away. I had been crying all morning and was wearing the most scruffy fleece and jeans. This guy by the bus stop was looking at me really intensely but I walked past and ignored him and waited for the bus. I thought it was all fine because when my bus came he got on but went upstairs and I sat downstairs by the back. The bus was quite busy and there were lots of people around. A few min later he came and sat down opposite me and started looking at me in a really leery way it made me feel really uncomfortable - I was so scared that I immediately stood up and went to stand near the doors to the bus, facing away from him. He then got up and stood next to me and said ‘you fucking bitch’ and got off the bus. I hadn’t said a word the whole time. And then when the bus doors closed and the bus drove away he stood facing me on the pavement and made lots of up yours hand gestures to me. The bus was really full and no one said anything, even as I burst into tears.",,
"when i was in primary school i stayed over at a friends house, we decided to play cops and robbers and they were the cop. at one point they pinned me to the bed and kept grinding on me and wouldnt stop even when i tried to get up, i had to just lay there until they were done. i didnt realise until i was older that it wasnt okay what happened . maybe consent and handling urges needs to start being taught at a younger age, parents act as if children aren't thinking about those kinds of things and yet this happened to me in year 6! it just needs to be handled properly.",,
"I bumped into a boy I knew from back home in a club whilst in my first year at university. We kissed a few times at the club and since we lived in the same accommodation, he walked me home. However he also walked me up to my flat and then to my room. I asked him to leave and he kept making excuses, I knocked on all my flatmates doors, but they were all out and I didn’t know what to do. Alarm bells were going off in my head, I wanted him out my flat but physically he was much bigger and also, if he really was harmless, what would everyone back home say? That I kicked him out with nowhere to go?,I agreed to let him sleep on my floor, but he kept making excuses and eventually I let him in my bed. Then he kept pestering for sex and after half an hour of telling him no and trying to ignore him, I agreed in the hope he’d leave me alone. ,He got what he wanted and eventually I drifted off to sleep only to be woken by him having sex with me, screaming I pushed him off me and eventually he left. When I finally reported it to the uni, first I was told not to tell anyone, then when speaking to head of campus security she made me aware that pressing charges would cause more distress due to many men believing I “was asking for it” by letting him stay.",,
The boys in the year had a group chat and would send photos of the girls making comments on their appearance. They would make sexual edits using the girls faces. They had an online game of ‘cards against humanity’ with cards about raping girls for different reasons. One being to do with someone being underaged and another being to get a noise out of her. The chat was ‘outed’ and posted on the boys Snapchat story but hidden from the girls talked about. The girls found out and were criticised for being ‘too mature for a bit of fucked up humour’. And they found it ‘funny we were mad’. It was reported to the school and the screenshots were shown to teachers. The boys were spoken to. They were not made to apologise. There was no further communication with the girls who reported it. The boys parents were not told. They received an email for ‘acting maturely’ in response to the situation.,,
I was sexually assaulted by a fellow student at the top of a climbing tower in front on students and a teacher without anyone noticing. I was frozen. This pupil later did the same to my friend on a school mini bus.,,
A guy who I barely knew would rub up against me and masturbate in front of me while blocking the door. I later found out that he would watch lots of extremely violent and illegal porn and that he was turned on by my self-harm marks. I still feel sick every time I think about that.,,
"i was emotionally manipulated into repeatedly having sex with a boy that was older than me when i was 14 , he took advantage of the fact that i was extremely emotionally unstable at the time due to family problems , bereavement, alcohol abuse and depression, he later admitted to me without me asking that it was easy to use me because i was vulnerable",,
"When I was 13 I was with my boyfriend at home, and we got a bit tipsy and I fell asleep on the couch. I was just in my underwear and he took a picture of him lying on my ass and sent it to a group chat- it ended up circulating around his school and I didn’t find out until weeks later.",,
"I was told I’d be raped by a person on my course, informed my lecturers and said I was going to the police and I got removed from the course",,
Two years ago i went to the cinema with a boy and all was fine until he started touching me in ways i was uncomfortable with i believed this to be normal and i thought it was my fault but now i realise it wasnt,,
It was a normal middle of the day at work. I had just turned 16 and finished my GCSES and was so ready to earn a lotta money. I had to serve these two obviously tipsy men outside and when I had put down their beers one of them started being genuinely friendly. Since my job was pretty big on service I chatted a bit before trying to leave without making it awkward. This is the point when one of them started to try and hug me goodbye and was just grabbing up on me and being all gross trying to offer me a tip. The thing is though is that I didn’t even see this as harassment until recently cause it’s got so normalised. Like this sucks and I don’t want my future daughter growing up thinking it’s a normal occurrence to get groped by some gross ass old men.,,
So many boys have made me feel pressed into sending nudes. I’ve done it once and I still feel gross about it. Sometimes I worry he’s going to see me in the streets or something and tell people about what I did.,,
"We were going to have sex for the first time, I was a virgin. Something felt off and I decided I didn’t want to. He begged and begged and then asked me if I would “at least” give him a blowjob. I didn’t feel like that either but I did it because I didn’t want to upset him - it was coercive behaviour but it didn’t match up with what I’d been told about how sexual harassment looked so I didn’t think much more about it.",,
"I was added to a group chat with multiple boys in it, they started to talk about sexually harassing girls, when i left i kept getting added back.",,
I had a friend over to my house. He poured us a wine from my kitchen and it wasn't until many months of quizzing myself about events that took place I realized he had spiked my wine.,,
"[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is filled with privileged boys who condemn racism and misogyny. I know multiple girls who have been assaulted by boys at this school, myself included. Although this happens no one speaks up because the boys show no empathy and make jokes about events, they say ‘boys will be boys’ ‘it was just a laugh’ ‘he’s one of the lads’ or ‘X would never do that’. Some girls are no better by supporting the boys. I only know of one girl properly speaking out, she of course left straight after, but this shouldn’t be the situation. I am terrified to even write this anonymous testimony due to the shaming from peers, the school isn’t the problem it’s the horrible culture amongst pupils who don’t understand what rape is.",,
"My ex boyfriend was very emotionally manipulative. Shortly after we had broken up, he got with another girl and then the next morning he threatened me with suicidal messages and then switched his phone off. I was forced to call his mum as I thought he had killed himself. He would also share intimate details about our sex life to his male friends and then deny that he had said anything. This emotional manipulation has left me with trust and confidence issues to this day.",,
"i was talking to this guy and we finally hung out he got a little handsy but i was like oh well because we were talking he eventually said he had blue balls and made me feel bad, he took me upstairs and insisted i helped him and continued to make me feel bad, out of guilt i gave him oral but when he said it wasn’t working for him i said i didn’t know what to tell him he insisted and insisted we do more because he had blue balls after he continued to make me feel bad about it we had sex. he flipped me over and shoved my face in the pillow it hurt. terribly. i wanted to go home. i didn’t let myself be alone with a guy until now with my current boyfriend i don’t know if this counts but i thought i’d tell",,
"I have had multiple experiences. The first when I was around 9 (in the 80s) whilst walking my dog. A local man exposed himself to me up the fields where we'd go. The second happened around the same time, we were on holiday at a beach playing in the sand dunes (the 3 of us were a similar age) and a man came and masturbated, then ejaculated in front of us. Luckily there was another family on the beach we could run to and the police were called. A third time, when I was 18, walking a home at night, my cousin and I were followed home and the man over took us to wait down an alley for us, as we walked past, he was masturbating. A fourth time, I used to live in France, and walking home one night with a friend, a man started masturbating in front of us. Even today, I am always afraid if I'm out walking and see a man. It also took me many years to realise in the past I have actually been raped during non consensual sex when I've been drunk. I was taken into a pub toilet when I was 18, I didn't want to have sex but was forced over the toilet and raped. One night at uni after being very drunk I met a guy and we went back to mine, I passed out only to wake up and find a used condom on the floor...i could never have consented. Another time was with a boyfriend. He came home drunk and forced himself on me, I was all swollen and sore afterwards. I do wonder if all that what happened when I was younger had an effect on how i was treated later.",,
"I was sexually harrassed by my cousins uncle on Christmas 3 years ago and have never said anything ever since. I dont want to go through the details but it has pretty much ruined my trust for most men. I still see him at family gatherings and i know he remembers. All i hope is that he has atleast some shame and regret for what he did, because while boys are being boys, women are suffering in silence.",,
"When I was 18 I got into [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] for an art foundation, I balled my eyes out I was so excited and proud of myself. It was freshers week and I was nervous to go and meet all these new people so my best friend came along with me. We were having a great night, it was a bar crawl so I was very drunk when we got to the last place. I went out into the smoking area, started talking to this guy. To this day I can not remember his face. We kissed and then he asked if I’d walk him to the bus stop. So we were walking but went past the bus stop to this side path where there was this brick wall corner. He pushed me into it, I thought we were gonna just continue kissing but he spun me round and pushed his head into the back of my neck so my head was pressing into the brick. He pulled down my pants and rammed his dick into me. I was a virgin. I was in shock, froze and so much pain I didn’t move cause I was scared. Then suddenly I snapped out of it. Pushed him off and walked away back to the bar where my friend was looking for me. I told her I was bleeding and we needed to leave. I gave up on the art foundation. Gave up in general. It broke me. It’s taken years of therapy to realise it wasn’t my fault. But If I’m honest I still blame myself for walking with him.",,
"When I was about 17 I met my friend in my local where I also worked. She was with her boyfriend and a man was with them that I didn't know, he was probably in his 40's and seemed to know my friend's boyfriend. As we were chatting, out of nowhere he grabbed me and kissed me really hard on the lips. He was trying to put his tongue in my mouth and I clenched my teeth together. I was pulling away from him and ended up lying on the floor as a result at which point he just walked off. No one said or did anything except for my friend who shouted at him but in truth they didn't know what to do. I was so embarrassed getting up off the floor and felt humiliated. They said he was just a bit odd.",,
"I was nine, I was on my way to school. It was snowy and near Christmas - he asked me what I wanted for Christmas, I ignored him, he said he had a present for me I ignored him. He pushed me back in the snow, I fell to the ground. He got on top of me and tried to push my skit up and touched me. He said he wanted to have it off with me. I managed to fight him off me. I ran to school, I told the teacher he said walk a different way home tonight. I asked my mom what have it off meant. She didn’t tell me, she called the police. I told the police, they said they would have a word and tell him not to do it again.",,
"when i was left alone with a close family me never he repeatedly touched me and i was clearly uncomfortable the touching got progressively worse until he legitimately raped me, this man was someone i used to look up to. absolutely vile",,
"I was 14 years old stood waiting for my class to begin in the room full of people, it was one of my friends (male) birthday and his friends held my arms back so I couldn’t resist and another made my friend grope my breasts, they then claimed it was the least I could do as it was his birthday",,
"I was 16. My boyfriend had just been arrested for possession of child p*rn. I went to my safeguarding team for help - because that is such a traumatising ordeal. Rumours escaped across my year that I was lying about being raped to get him in trouble. I went back to safeguarding. They told me there was nothing they could do because it was happening outside of school. I recieved no support. They expected me to continue with my A-Levels like it was nothing. I was humiliated in front of my friends, and my peers, for nearly three months afterwards - I was labelled a liar, a freak and a whore. And I had no support from anyone. No support from the people who were meant to protect me - to offer the support I deserved.",,
"When I was 15 was on a plane with my family but we were all separated because those were the only tickets left. This man (around 60) with his 5 year old daughter came and sat next to me. His wife was a few rows ahead. I put my seat belt on, and his seat belt was very clearly next to him. Without warning he reached under my bum and felt around for it for a a while. It obviously wasn’t there. I did nothing because I was shocked and his child was right next to him. Even if he thought I was sitting on it he could have got me to stand up but he just reached under with no warning and didn’t apologise or look uncomfortable for the rest of the journey. I had to sit next to him for the next 2 hours. I was shocked, confused and scared not only for me but this little girl, and that means I can’t even imagine what others who experience worse feel like.",,
A man approached me on a tube and chatted to me asking me lots of questions including what stop I was getting off at. He told me he was a uni student and I shouldn’t be afraid of him. He then began to show me naked pictures of himself with a boner ‘here are some pictures I think you’ll like’ he said. I asked him to leave me alone. He didn’t - I looked around for help from others - no one did anything. Terrified - I waited for the next stop then sprinted off the tube just as the doors were closing.,,
"I don’t mean to undermine any girls’ story on here because anything that happens to them must be horrible; when i was 13 my gf at the time started sending me nudes and i had no idea what to do back, she started guilt tripping me and acting sad when i said i didn’t know if i wanted to say anything and eventually just stopped talking to me til i did. she then just used me as a form of pleasure until she eventually found something more fun, and stopped speaking to me. i know she was under 11 when she first tried exploiting boys.",,
"I'd moved to a new school for year 6 and had been there about 6-8 months (this was 6 years ago now) and we had a sex education lesson. I'd moved next door to a boy who sat on my table, we were friendly enough but not real friends. A couple of girls started joking that we should give a demonstration of sex to the class, as they'd got it into their heads we were together and slept in each other's gardens as we lived next door. I was really embarrassed and he was trying to laugh it off, I'm sure they didn't actually believe we were together and I'd certainly showed no interest in him. I felt quite insecure around him and these girls for a while as some others heard us. We sat at the back and whilst other kids heard us I'm confident my teacher wouldn't have done. I knew I'd done nothing wrong but I felt so startled that they thought that was a funny comment to make and whilst a friend told me later she too was uncomfortable with it, these girls were popular and at the time I thought standing up to them would make it appear that I had slept with this guy. Since starting secondary school, this guy has told loads of people we live next door as we're in most classes together and I still hear people assuming that means we're together and have sex in each other's garden",,
my teacher looked at my ass and slapped it,,
"i was at a dinner but i left around 11;30 as i wanted to meet other friends . i left alone. i was walking up to [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] (where there’s no cameras or anything) and i noticed a guy, i wasn’t sure if he was following me so i went around a few times and then i realized he was. i started to run but he caught up to me. he hit me and threw me to the ground and sat on top of me holding my hands down. he was getting off his jeans and boxers and pulled down my leggings. he was about to rape me but i started screaming and hitting him as much as i could. i got him off before he could do anything and he ran off. i have no clue who the person is till this day. i’ve also never told anyone",,
"First time I was touched inappropriately I was 11. It was in my PE lesson and we were doing trampolining and because I was small I needed help to get onto the trampoline, the teacher was a middle aged man and help me in places that max me very uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because I was scared of what he might do if he found out I said those things. At 13 I was pressured multiple time by a guy to send photos of myself and when I said no, he called me frigid and that he would tell everyone about it. So is sent the photos because i felt guilty. The school found out and I got blamed for it. A couple months later, I was wearing my summer uniform and sat crossed legged and thought I had made sure my skirt was down so you couldn’t see up my skirt but I was obviously wrong. I realised this boy kept looking up my skirt and after multiple time telling him to stop and moving so he couldn’t, he continued to make comment about my underwear, body and how he would fuck me. After the lesson he followed me round for the rest of the day harassing me about it. I went and told someone about it who the school claimed to be a “trusted member of staff” and told me that “it was my fault for being so vulnerable and that I should have taken more care and worn shorts underneath”. The boy got no punishment and then later groped a girl “to take her mind off of the pain from a stinging nettle”. He still didn’t get any punishment. At 15 (when I had my first boyfriend), he made me do sexual things with him when I didn’t want to half the time and every time we saw eachother, I had to give him a blowjob because I “owed it to him and wouldn’t be a good girlfriend if I didn’t”. He then later had sex with me after he got me very drunk to a point I was unconscious, then lied about it, then told me that I said it ‘‘my idea to have sex’’ and it was fine because he used a condom. The next day I had to go and get a oral contraceptive pill and told him about it and the only thing he said was “okay whatever. Just don’t be pregnant otherwise I will leave you”. Somehow it got around my school and then was continuously victim blamed and shamed and was being called a “slut” and how I should have just “closed my legs” or “just let him have his fun”. Multiple times I have been groped by guys I know or random men on public transport. Cat-called countless times. Slut shamed for what I wear or my sexual history of what I have done. My most recent ‘relationship’ was probably one of the worst. (He was a vile, repulsive guy that I only got with because I just wanted to feel validated I guess.) I never said no to him because I knew he would get violent and I was scared of what he would do. Every time we had sex I wanted it to be over. It hurt so bad and I though I would get over my past experiences but it just made it worse. I had a panic attack once and told him to get off of me. He eventually did and then told me I was “being dramatic” and that “I was asking for it”. He would always hold me down or restrict me in some sort of way and then ask “if someone was kidnapping you or going to rape you, how would you get out of this” and then would laugh at me because he was obviously stronger than me and made me feel stupid. He told me that everything we did would just stay between us and promised me. For the past week, his friends who go to my school have been harassing me and asking me about him and taking the mick about the sexual relationship I’ve had with him. And after all of that. I’ve never felt so guilty and disappointed in myself. And it’s not my fault. But obviously to society “it is my fault” because ‘I was too easy and kept my guard up’",,
"I lost my virginity to rape at the age of 14. I was ashamed and disgusted with myself and couldn't tell anyone. I felt so dirty. He told people at school that we had shagged and they laughed about it. I couldn't talk about it for years. It affected my relationships for years and I found sex frightening at times, even when it shouldn't have been. Still now, decades later, it can affect me.",,
"My ex-boyfriend and I had recently broken up. I often felt very used for sex and my mental health was suffering. He did seem to respect the fact that I didn’t want to be in a relationship with him any longer, and we both agreed that we would just be friends. But just a week later we were both going to a party, and he wouldn’t leave me alone all night and everything we had spoken about seemed to be forgotten as he was still groping and trying to kiss me. The next morning I was waiting to be picked up and we were alone together. He kept saying it was hard for him to accept just being friends and wouldn’t stop touching me. I was telling him to stop and he knew I was scared, but he kept on trying to undress me. I was in shock and felt unable to escape, I kept saying no and looking the other way but he would just get closer and closer. I couldn’t see a way around it and I ended up just laying there on the verge of tears as he had sex with me, all I wanted to do was go home."",I went on with my life with attachment issues and consequently even though I am happily married I still have ptsd when it comes to intimacy.",,
"It was the second time we met up. He suggested we go for a drive, and drove me straight to the woods. Before I knew it he started to try and push himself in, I was too scared to say no, and froze. I’d kissed him but I didn’t want this. My body refused to let him in, so he proceeded to spit on his hand to make it easier for him to get in. Afterwards he left me to deal with the morning after pill and didn’t speak to me again.",,
"It was common knowledge that boys in our friendship group during sixth form had “locked” albums on their phones, that contained the nudes of various girls in the year group or wider school that is they would share among themselves. Certain boys even bragged about sharing their current girlfriend’s pictures with their friends",,
"I was waiting for the buses outside school when I was 14 and some boy in my year got dared to grab my boobs. He came over, put his arm around me and grabbed me in front of everyone. I felt so uncomfortable but I felt like I had to be a good sport.",,
"Whoever that was, I was a victim of sexual assault from 3 different boys in that year at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], and my friends had several weird experiences with them. They used to organise parties that only ‘peng girls’ can come to, and if you’re ‘clapped’ you have to pay £10. The organiser, who has now been expelled from uni after 28 different cases, used to say some girls could come if they sucked his dick. Little did we know there was a group of them who used to organise these parties where they got us all drunk and would stay kinda sober, would force us into the bathroom where they would ‘help us out’ but would instead get raped. The year were very silent on this matter.",,
"""I have a few stories of actual physical assault but I wanted to share this story since it's important to highlight how young girls can be targeted and groomed by young boys and men online.,I am now in my early 20s but this is from when I was in year 8 up until my late teens. My friend's boyfriend and I became really good friends on Facebook. He would often message me asking about her to plan out dates, surprises etc. The three of us were all good friends. Eventually, he started getting more interested in me which I took as being friendly at first. It wasn't long before he became romantically interested to which I repeatedly told him was wrong since he was with my friend. After some time he became very inappropriate, texting me about how he thinks about me sexually - how he imagines me while having sex with her. This was very uncomfortable for me since I felt a combination of disgust from his end, and guilt for my friend. Whenever he was sexual, I would ignore his texts and messages, try to avoid hanging out with them to keep my distance. But it didn't stop. He would leave me alone for a few months before finding his way back to me again and guilting me into sexting him - the guilt since he was still with my friend and he would threaten me that he'd tell her that I """"led him on"""". It took a lot of uncomfortable situations, unsolicited pictures of his penis, texts from him telling me he was wanking off to me, and courage for me to delete all my social media and remove all access he had to me. The last I know of him is that he's engaged to my friend. She still doesn't know he did this behind her back and I still haven't rid the guilt he made me feel for everything.""",,
As early as I can remember boys would touch me at school. wether it started with them making comments about my body till it escalated to getting assaulted on the bus or in the stair well i have never felt safe at school.,,
"I went home with a guy from a bar. I was 19, he was about 28/29. I was into it at first, and we got undressed and started doing things in his bed. He put a finger somewhere I didn’t want him too, and it really hurt - I asked to stop and said I was going to leave. He convinced me to stay the night, and didn’t offer for me to sleep in anything (I was fully naked and all I had with me was a dress), I said I really didn’t want to do anything more, because I was completely turned off and freaked by the whole situation. I then woke up to him fingering me. He went to the bathroom and I grabbed my clothes and ran out - I thought if I didn’t leave, something much worse would happen. I contacted him on Instagram recently after finding him, and messaged him saying “did something happen a few summers ago”. He replied “yeah, we fucked.” I wonder to this day if we actually did and I blocked it out or something.",,
This boy is know for sexually assaulting/raping multiple girls and many people know that he has done to people including the school. I was 15 and very drunk and he took advantage of me. He pulled me into a room and pulled my pants down and proceeded to have sex with me and he kept on saying stop pushing me. He eventually stoped and made me do things to him and then took me into the bathroom to watch him do things. He then made me promise him not to tell anyone because he knew my family and friends,,
"When walking home from work, I bumped into a former [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] student who apparently recognised me, although I didn't know him. He had just left a house party somewhere in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We sat on a wall, smoked a cigarette and talked about our mutual friends. He suggested we go to a bar for one drink, then he would book me an Uber home (my phone was dead). I agreed but explicitly said - 'Not as a date- Im not going to kiss you'.,The bar turned out to be closed so I asked him to book me an Uber. He convinced me to take the bus with him to his house as it was 'on the way to mine'. I didn't want to walk 45 minutes home on my own in the dark, and I trusted his character - so I agreed.,""I got sexually assaulted and the boy would not get off me and I kept saying stop and he kept going (fingering me)",,
"Only last March I was put into a dark place by this one boy in my year, it got so much to the point where I tried to take my own life. It's been just over a year now, the scars are finally fading and I don't know whether that's a good thing or not.",,
This boy was sexting me before we went back to school [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and I kinda went along of course . But he minipulated me to date him and one time we were after school waiting for my basketball hall game I had to cheer at and we were walking the halls and he was pushing me in the bathroom and taking my cloths off saying he’s going to fuck me whether I like it or not . I never once even while sexting said I wanted to have sex I had never said that and this is only one of the things that happened at my school . He kept trying but I kept pushing him away and I ran out and ran outside my school crying,,
"I was first sexually assaulted was I was 9, it was by a 14 year old boy that used to get my school bus. I didn’t say anything to my parents until I was 15 because I wasn’t really aware of what happened to me and then when I learnt about sexual assault and harassment I was embrasser. Then when I was 14, I went out to have a drink with some friends. When they left I was alone with this guy who I had been friends with for a year. He pushed me onto my knees and then grabbed my head and forced me onto his dick. I wasn’t able to fight back so I didn’t cover my my teeth and then I when he flinched I got up and ran. I didn’t tell anyone when it happened cause I felt like it was my fault and there had been so many other occasions of stuff like this at my school where nothing happened to the boy and the girl just ended up being blamed or shamed",,
"Throughout my final year of middle school a boy in my class repeatedly sought me out and groped me in the hallway between lessons. This happened more times than I can count. He took advantage of the crowds of students to violate me in public, mostly going completely unnoticed. One time he smacked me so hard it left a bruise. Another time he flashed me. I challenged him multiple times, but he just laughed and kept doing it. The experience was so humiliating that for years afterwards I was extremely self-conscious of my body, wearing long, baggy shirts that hid my body to try and make myself 'unappealing' in the hope it would never happen again. I also blamed myself for a long time, believing I had done something to make him behave that way, whereas in reality I went out of my way to avoid him. I felt too ashamed to ever report it, and amused reaction from other students on the occasions they did witness him grope me reinforced that.",,
"I was texting this french boy who i knew from a french exchange. he screenshot my nudes without my knowledge and when i told him i wasn’t comfortable sending anything else to him, he tried to blackmail me with these screenshots. he said if i didn’t send a video of me fingering myself with three fingers he would share them with everyone he knew. he did end up showing my nudes to the other people i met from the french exchange, luckily no one in the uk though",,
At a flat party and i was in a corner with a group of boys who after I said i had a boyfriend kept harassing me and asking me to go out with them when I kept saying no to a date - one of them kept feeling up my leg and kept saying “your mans shit why isn’t he here for you now”. It turned out these boys also had a bet to see if they could all get with the same girl that night,,
a few months ago i had been feeling down about several things. a boy in my year said he would be able to help me and said i should suck his dick to try and get over the previous incidents. eventually after a while i agreed to do so and did it. straight after it happened he made me delete the messages that showed any evidence of anything happened and when it started going around school he had said i made it up and the rumours got even worse.,,
i have been on facetime to what i thought was a friend and he decided it would be a good idea to show me his penis which was quite upsetting after that i hung up and blocked him never to speak to him again,,
"I went to the girls school but Ive experienced harrassment from boys in my year up to two years above. One tried to twist my words to pressure me to have sex, he used guilt/flattery/anger until i just removed myself from the situation. At the time i only told a mutual friend so he could speak to the boy and i blocked him but still felt the need to protect him by acting like nothing happened every time i saw him. The school already knows about this boy because of situations with other girls but i never heard of any consequences he had to face.,Another has gone to uni and i hear stories of him targetting drunk girls at parties, which is terrifying knowing that i was approached by him only 2 years ago. The creepy tendencies were already there, and clearly escalated.",,
"When i was at a party, i was drinking because i wanted to have fun and forget about some bad things. I became so drunk that my friends who were boys pretended to help me by taking me up to a tree house and then they tried to kiss me. They all left but one and i was trying to sleep but he was spooning me and tried to put his hands in my pants. Before he could do anything my friend came in and took me away as she realised what the boys had tried to do. That same night i was groped by numerous boys without permission. These boys i am still friends with to this day. I tried being off with them but i felt so alone and isolated from everyone else, so i gave in and thought what had happened was okay, just like a lot of people did. It made me feel worthless and used.",,
"I was minding my business doing my work, as a boy started to massage my shoulders, I instantly turned around and said stop it please, but he’s one of them wanna be roadmen he said “Ayo tell me what bag u want yeah I’ll lick dat for you innit”. I rushed out of the room and went home, the next day I hoped he would leave me alone but him and his friend backed me into a corner in the toilet and started closing in on me, I was screaming but nobody could hear me as it was the end of the school day and the toilets have very thick walls. I couldn’t do anything and they just started saying mean things to me attempting to rip off my clothes but thankfully they heard the door open and that’s when I sprinted out and decided to change schools",,
"i was 6 when i was raped. he help me down by my shoulders/forearms, i was so tiny his hands covered almost half my arms. i felt like i was being crushed because he was so much heavier than me, and i could tell he was barely putting any weight on me. i couldn’t move because i was so small in his grip. i was terrified. he was penetrating me and it felt like burning, it’s the most horrific pain i’ve ever experienced, i felt like my entire insides were being ripped apart. i wouldn’t wish that on anyone. i just remember trying to hide that i was crying from the pain, i was trying to be brave. he was just telling me quietly that ‘i was going to be okay’, ‘i was doing really well’, and that ‘it was going to be done soon’. the painfully thing is, even if i knew who that man was, not only would i get the justice i deserved. but he would never understand the pain he caused me, not only in that moment, but for these 10 years after.",,
"It all started off with a friendship and then it led to me being invited around his house ,he pressured me and manipulated me into doing things with him by saying I was the only thing that made him happy and that if I loved him I’d do it, he’d also use that he was suicidal and I was the only thing keeping him going lockdown was a god send as it got me away from his toxicity and made me realise the whole situation, school were informed and then I was sat by him in my leavers assembly and school didn’t even move me away from him",,
"It happened about a year ago and honestly it hasn’t affected me in a huge way.,Despite this it was incredibly uncomfortable and an experience that made me feel uneasy.,The girl was extremely drunk so I’ve given her the benefit of the doubt as she may have misunderstood what was going on.( I do feel however that the excuse of oh they were drunk is not at all an acceptable one),After all of this, I have told many of my guy friends who have been supportive and kind while the women close to me in my life I have decided not to tell. This is because in so many occasions a girl has told me “ oh my friend got assaulted, that’s something you woudont understand” or “you couldn’t imagine how unpleasant it is being around boys sometimes” this if I’m honest makes me incredibly uncomfortable as this stereotype that is evolving has caused an incredibly unpleasant situation for men that makes it harder for them to come out with these stories. Obviously I know it is almost all men commiting these offences and men are mainly the problem, but many girls talk all loud on social media and then patronise boys who have been victims, maybe I’m being over the top but personally for me it has caused moments were I can barely hold myself together because a girl who hasn’t been assaulted tells me I know nothing. Shameful.",,
"This happened recently, i’m 17 and i have this “friend” i guess whose slightly older than me. We’ve been messing around for a bit , did some things but i’ve made it abundantly clear about things i do not wanna do. His birthday was recently and i went over and spent the night. Everything was okay till he started drinking, he got a little rough which isn’t something i’m against sexually but, it was jus different; rougher. He turned me over and anally penetrated me. This was in the i don’t wanna do column. I told him no repeatedly, i turned around and pull my pants up and that didn’t help any, so i let him. He turned me around and roughly started again. I was numb, i just layed there attempting not to cry by trying to watch the pointless video on his tv. What could i have did, i live 45 minutes away and it was 4:00 in the morning. I was stuck. I went to the bathroom after and cleaned myself up. I’m so ashamed.",,
I said no and he didn’t listen. so i said yes the next day and he slut shamed me for it. you can’t win isolating yourself and you can’t win in confidence . you can’t win as a women in todays society.,,
"I had been chatting to this guy I really liked and after a couple months we decided to go away together. He asked me out the first night and it was all really sweet. One morning when we were both in bed I was woken up by a feeling on my bum (i was naked) it felt like a dick. I was confused so I moved away from him and tried to fall back asleep. It happened a couple more times and I realised that he was actually trying to fuck me while I was sleeping. I confronted him about it asking him what it was and he just gaslit me calling me crazy. I was so disgusted I threw up. The next day I found out I was pregnant. Although he knew, he kept on trying to fuck me even when I said I didnt want to, his excuse being ""well ur already pregnant"" then hed just get angry. I only realised it was sexual assault a couple months later, and I never told anyone because I thought and still think it's not as important as other stories even though it made/makes me feel absolutely disgusting.",,
"Almost everyday, boys I go to school with continuously touch me in inappropriate places and laugh or while hugging me they touch my ass and it still happens. I always ask them to stop or even have to push them off me. They never listen and it happens all the time and I’m so sick of it. This has also happened to me out of school with other boys and they just laugh when I tell them to not touch me as if it’s a joke but it makes me so uncomfortable.",,
Sexually assaulted in middle school by two football boys at the same time.,,
this girl put her hands down my pants whilst i was having a panic attack and couldnt see or breath so i said no and asked her to stop but she wouldn’t and kept putting her hands down my pants and got mad it me for not having sex with her,,
My sisters boyfriend touched me inappropriately I was around 15,,
"I am from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], combining with [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and I got harrased. A girl touched me inappropriately and I felt incredibly uncomfortable. This story can be shared as awareness needs to be raised.",,
"In primary school one of the boys said he heard that apparently in Canada it counts as rape if you put your finger in someones bellybutton for over 5 seconds. This quickly got turned into a game involving the boys chasing the girls around the playground trying to get under our shirts shouting “I’m going to rape you!” or “you’ve just been raped!”. We were around 6 years old. We weren’t uncomfortable at all when one of the guys suggested we played it, In fact we all thought it was good fun. Goes to show how deep this culture really goes- in schoolyard games and no one bats an eye.",,
"I was raped by 2 different guys, one week from being exactly 3 years apart. The first time happened in 7th grade.",,
"i was in year 7 and there was this guy who was in afew of my classes. one day i was in an re class and he was sitting next to me. he and his friend kept looking at me and it made me feel kind of uncomfortable. the guy asked if i wanted to have s*x with his friend. he kept asking me other questions and wouldnt leave me alone.this made me feel really uncomfortable and self-conscious, and i later found out that they had asked quite afew other girls in my year. most of the people in my class were not even 12 yet.",,
i had a party at my house. i passed out in my bed upstairs. the next day i found out that this guy i barely knew undressed me and go into bed with me while i was unconscious lol.,,
"Rape is hardly an unusual subject of jokes here. Seems like it is almost impossible to go a day without hearing one. The problem is, though, people genuinely don’t understand how hurtful it is to survivors of sexual harassment and assault such as myself to hear these topics joked around with. Heard a boy at lunch yesterday jokingly threatening to rape a friend while playing a stupid Civ-style video game. More education is needed! It can’t come soon enough!",,
I was walking to class and this y9 or 10 I think was behind me. I get quite nervous when they are behind me cuz im quite short so they laugh or make fun off me. But this time I heard the guy wisper imagine that in bed. I didn't know who he meant at the time cuz there were so many people around. Bu then he said it would be like having a 7 Yr old I bed and that's when u knew he meant me. I was scared so I started walking faster but he juts came around my side and brushed his hand against my thigh. I have since avoided him and i know its not as horrible as other people but it still scared me im only 12.,,
the boys at my school used to trade nudes - like they used it as currency and they would trade one girl’s naked picture for another. the way that they acted and spoke about women and their bodies is something which massively shapes the way I live today. the idea that if you weren’t attractive you were valueless. the insanely high standards they placed on young girl’s bodies. they used to make tiers of girls (“I wanna get with a tier 1 girl tonight”) and those at the top were a greater prize than those lower down. like we were trophies. I really struggle with my self worth and identity because I spent my development years believing that I was objectively not good enough and that made me worthless. and that’s literally just the surface of it.,,
"My classmate and I sent some snaps on Snapchat for about a year until he started to compliment me and my body in a very sexual and uncomfortable way. He started to comment my body in school too with whispering in my ear. He made me very uncomfortable. After about two weeks he started to ask me for nudes. And I said no and told him I wasn’t comfortable and interested in that or him. He didn’t like my no. Eventually he pressed and threatened me into sending him nudes or he would spread fake nudes to the whole school. I was young and didn’t know any better so I sent them to him. The next day when I got to school he was showing them to everyone of his friends. I called my mom and said I was sick so she came and got me. My teacher then called my mom and told her what had happened. We reported to the police but they said “She sent them to him first and there’s no proof that she didn’t want to or that he had spread them to anyone else” when it clearly was proof and even my loving, best teacher stood up for me, but nothing happened.",,
It was a normal school day and i had a time out pass so i was outside my class. A kid in year 11 came up to me and started touching me in areas i didn’t want him to and flirted with me when i said no.,,
Alot of the boys in my school where in a WhatsApp group where they shared loads of nudes of girls in the year and rated them. Most people knew about this and it was just laughed off.,,
"I was sexually assaulted in my high school in year nine going into year ten, we wanted to get the police involved but the high school said what about the boys education, the things he did to me was he kissed me touched me on my bum and private area without my consent and grabbed my hand and made me to inch on he’s privates ,when I ran out of the room he chased after me after all that happen, I ran to my head of year and she said we will get it sorted I couldn’t come in the next two weeks because I was so scared of seeing him and if he would do it again all he got was a one day exclusion. I have had to live with two more years in a high school with him being in the same class with him near me when it horrified me it made me have panic attacks and physical illness,I went to the doctors because my parents were very scared of what I was thinking and the doctor diagnosed me with PTSD and what had happened to me in high school but still to this day I am scared of men and what they will do.",,
"During my time at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] from [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] several things happened to me that I only now realised was not normal. I was groped under my skirt on multiple occasions by boys sat next to me. A game was played called “Are you nervous?” in which boys would place their hand on your thigh and move it up progressively and ask if you “were nervous yet” and would not stop. There was also a day where the boys were allowed to slap the girls arses which happened to me on multiple occasions. I was also groped by boys in my friend group but it was seen as okay because they were my friends, I was just too scared to tell anyone. I had been cornered by boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when I refused to give them my number or my snapchat. Teachers at the school also participated in multiple questionable things. This included inappropriately touching girls in class. The school in general on a academic basis is not a bad school, but the lack of support these girls and boys receive when something like this does happen is shocking. Most of my friends experienced things similar during their times. To anyone reading this girl or boy, if anything makes you uncomfortable or feels wrong say no and tell someone. Do not feel ashamed because it is not your fault. Even if it’s years later and you have only just released that it was wrong. It could seriously help someone.",,
"If you walk anywhere close to the boys in the corridors of this school and are someone who is afab with curves, you will be touched inappropriately. No matter what you are wearing. And teachers don't do anything about it despite it happening infront of their eyes. What makes them listen is when you've had enough of it and are breaking down infront of them and even then all they do it tell off the perpetrators or exclude them for a bit because they believe youve blown it out of proportion.",,
"i was in y7 and was walking home at abt 5:30 after a club, i walked past this restaurant and there were a load of drunk men that starting shouting at me telling me to suck them off and that i was pretty and that i should go with them, i didn’t but i started running away and i heard one of them say ‘well she’s a bit frigid’ - i was 12 years old",,
"I was in Lower Sixth. Some of my friends and I were close with the year above and so ended up being invited to a lot of their 18ths. However, there was one where it was just myself and another girl and we had rushed to get to because we were late and consequently hadn’t had much time to pre drink. So we turned up basically sober, spoke to a few people and then got a drink at the bar. This was the only drink I had and this was the only drink my friend had. Within half an hour we were paralytic on the floor outside the marquee. I had no control over my body but was conscious. One of the year above boys comes over and says ‘I live near her, let me take her home, she’s not in a good way she shouldn’t be here anymore’. Next thing I know my friend and I are being carried into an Uber with a group of boys and are taken to his house. I then remember waking up alone in his bedroom, wondering where everyone was.. especially my girl mate that was in the same position as me. Next thing I know he comes in, starts taking my clothes off and then starts doing the business on me. We did not have sex but I did not consent what happened and I didn’t have the means to say stop because I had been spiked.",,
I was sexually assaulted by my bestfriend after school :/,,
First guy I dated assaulted me when I was borderline unconscious. And he knew what he did was wrong and disgusting because he didn’t tell his mates. And he always used to brag about his sexual conquests. He knew I didn’t consent. Too many situations like this and so little is done.,,
"In my early teens my art teacher attempted twice to kiss me, but I got away/ran away. Around the same time a man nearly had his way at a party, plus a neighbour. All around twice my age or older. I was vulnerable, unloving, abuse childhood/upbringing. The expectations all around me were coming from a culture of misogyny and abuse and disrespectful, stereotypical roles of women and men, handed down many generations. The internalisation of stereotypical male values by women has not helped those who have needed or need a voice and to be heard. I was silenced by ignorance. I have turned to Christianity in attempt to learn to trust. I am now 49, a single mother of a beautiful daughter. I am teaching her right from wrong, to stick up for herself and defend herself.",,
"Between the age of 15-16 every time I interacted with a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I was sexually harassed. Boys I didn’t know would on the spot ask personal questions like if I would have a threesome with them, to describe how I had sex with my girlfriend, what porn I watched. They also had competitions about who could get with the ugliest girl/who could sleep with the most girls which continued until I left school.",,
in october boys called it slap arse month and 3 boys would continually do it the whole month even though i made it clear it was weird,,
"From my time at school, there was a heavily ingrained culture of sexism and misogyny. ‘Slap a bum day’ was commonplace as were the offensive and derogatory names that me and the girls I knew were called daily."",6. Other behaviour considered “normal” relating to bum slapping/grabbing, shouting out, comments. Less now I’m older.",,
When I was in 3rd grade this boy would touch me by my butt and i would beg him not too but he didn’t listen and I cried and cried and he once did it in the cafeteria with a fork and no one saw. I was too afraid to tell anyone and still haven’t to this day.,,
"The girls in the school were rated on a scale of 1-10. At parties I'd hear the guys saying which girls in the year they would or wouldn't shag based on ratings. When I turned up to parties guys would ask me where my hotter friends were. In a classroom once a guy sat so close to me both of our thighs were fully touching, i moved away and he moved so they were touching again, then i moved till i always almost falling off my seat, i looked at him and he sat there smirking at me knowing what hed done. I had a group of Male friends in my final years at school, at some parties I'd see them pull down their trousers and expose themselves to other girls, 2 of them tried to grope me on occasions but i managed to get away. One time a guy told me I'd never get any Male attention unless i did loads of squats to make my butt big, insinuating how I was without that was valueless.",,
"When I was 18, it was my first time out clubbing. The people I was with one boy one girl. Watch an older male come close to me. And start trying to give my a love bite on my neck and when I tried to push him off. They just watch",,
"A nasty rumour was spread at my school that guys in the lower sixth were rating girls asses when they walked past groups of guys. Many of the girls who heard this were outraged but it turns out it was a lie made up by some other girls. When I found out it was a lie, I was shocked because girls were feeling paranoid about wearing tight jeans at school and being judged for it. It was awful that someone made up a lie like that, because it completely diminishes the actual real experiences people have with rape culture.",,
"I was on a date with this guy I’d never met before at his house. We had a few drinks and dinner and I remember thinking how nice and considerate he was. When he asked to have sex I said okay because I wanted to, but when we started he turned into a completely different person. After we took our clothes off and everything he got on top of me and tried to penetrate me. When I asked him to get a condom he kept saying something like ‘in a minute I’ll get one’ while he kept trying to enter me, and I kept saying no but jokingly. After asking him a few times to get a condom and him saying ‘I will’, it was clear that he wasn’t going to, so I just let him penetrate me even though I felt uncomfortable. I wish I had said no, pushed him off and left, but in the moment I felt like I couldn’t. From that moment onwards I just let him do whatever because I wasn’t into it anymore. I remember him suddenly fingering my ass really deep and telling him to stop. After he finished I said something like ‘you really need to wear a condom you know’ and he told me to stop guilt tripping him. I don’t really know if that was rape or not, because it didn’t feel like it then, but writing this I’m not so sure.,When I texted him afterward to ask if he had been tested for stds recently, he just replied that he had and that it would probably be fine. He said he would get tested again that week, but then he never replied again or even opened my messages, even when I texted him again a week later.,I almost convinced myself I had gotten HIV from him and got so worried and went to a clinic multiple times to get blood tests. I couldn’t relax and the thought was weighing on me for months when I went to bed at night and when I woke up in the morning.",,
snapchat is amazing but you get the odd few boys who proceed to send inappropriate photos after i told them i was underage. this one person was really sweet to me at first we messaged for a couple months and then he asked if i could send pictures of myself while i was in the shower. i said no and he told me that i was boring and ugly and insecure and that was the reason i didn't send to him. i blocked him but i thought about his words quite a lot. it's not nice to receive unsolicited dick pics at age 13 or at any age in fact. just stay safe and true to yourself and don't let the pressure get to you as you are better than that.,,
"After I came out as bisexual lots of boys at this school started asking me to have a threesome with them and other homophobic comments. Then they started to spread rumours that I had agreed to it, making up stories of how I was in bed and that I was sending them nudes. Girls in my school believed it and I was bullied for years.",,
I’m a boy and this is kinda tough to say. In school a number of girls slap mine and other boys asses and take it further by even grabbing our private area. I’ve been quiet about it and just laughed it off but genuinely I used to cry my self to sleep. I’m extremely insecure about that stuff and the fact that I’m a “man” whenever I told people they said move on or it’s not that deep. I think that there needs to be more awareness of sexual harassment on boys.,,
A boy touched me and asked to have ***,,
I had told a guy who I considered a good friend about my experience with a guy who had sexually assaulted me to be replied with “ah I rate him for doing that”. This toxic lad banter has got to stop. No girl should ever be told that her rapist is “rated” for his actions.,,
"In my first year of university I was at a club. Somehow I went from tipsy to unable to stand and a housemate of my friend found me. I remember him half carrying me home I was so drunk. I woke up in the morning in his bed wearing only my pants. I don’t remember how I got there. When I woke up his hand was between my legs and I was frozen in place, too scared to move. I pretended I was still asleep in the hope he would stop but he continued it further eventually going down on me. I feel sick at the thought of bumping into him on campus.,To this day I’m too scared to tell my friends what happened, even the one that lived with him.",,
"I spent a whole year in Geography, in year 9. I sat next to a boy who spent the most part of every lesson trying to grope me. He would put his hands under my skirt and move up towards my knickers. I used to dread the lessons, I was anxious, it was depressing; the teacher was a man who set work from a book and then left the room, he didn’t actually teach anything. I could not move, I dare not tell because I was scared of repercussions from the boys in the year. I was sexually assaulted on a weekly basis. Really depressing. There was nobody to tell.",,
he kept touching my thighs under the desk everyday and moving my legs onto his and i didn’t know how to stop him,,
"I didnt realise that I was raped until my current boyfriend asked me whether the sex was consensual (after telling him about this). I was on a social with my sports team and I was far too drunk. I remember running into a friend on another team, someone who had tried to get with me before but I didn’t want to get with. I don’t remember much more beyond that. I remember the feeling of walking down a road and I remember being in the bed but not seeing anything or what he did to me. When I woke up I was disorientated and confused- I turned around and saw him and realised I was naked and don’t have any recollection of how I came to be naked. I was trying to work out what time it was and where in Southampton I was. He said to me as I was trying to figure out what had happened “oh you might need some reminding of what happened last night”. I didn’t think we’d had sex but I also had no idea what had happened. When I walked to my match later that day, I was sore and I hurt. I ignored the nagging thought that something terrible might have happened, thinking he wouldn’t have done that to me in the state I was in. He was a well known, popular guy and known as a “nice guy”. I ignored it until a week later at some pres, his friend came up to me and said “oh I heard you shagged x”. I denied it - as far as I was aware I hadn’t and didn’t want to acknowledge the possibility he’d taken advantage of my drunken state. Turns out he had and from what he said to me in the morning, he perfectly well knew how drunk I was. He hadn’t used a condom and because I didn’t know what he’d done to me, I didn’t get the morning after pill. My housemates were there for me though my abortion but to this day, I still can’t believe what happened. I always got a bit tight chested when I saw him after that but it makes a lot more sense now, once I realised he raped me. I blamed myself because I was drunk but in reality I had no capacity to and did not consent to what he did to me.",,
"When I was around 14/15 I was at a house party where I had drank a bit much and put myself to bed fully clothed where I had woken up naked and a boy I thought was a friend behind me naked as well, spooning me. I was so frightened I just laid there and he woke up thinking I was still asleep and started touching me and tried fingering me which was when I got up got dressed and ran home at 6am. No one has ever known of this story as I’ve always been told it will ruin their life if stories of sexual assault ever gets out so I’ve kept quiet every time.",,
"I think many men of our generation feel entitled to be sexually pleased by a woman. A lot of the time it’s not a malicious thing that they are conscious about - this is what is terrifying and shows how important testimonies are so thank you for this page. A few years ago I lost my virginity to a boy, a very sweet and genuinely kind guy who I was aware struggled with his self esteem. One afternoon I met up with him unplanned at his uni acom just to hang out because I was in the area. I didn’t feel comfortable having sex with him and was very clear about that with him, but rather than respecting that, he emotionally manipulated me into believing that my not sexually pleasing him affected his self esteem and made him feel bad about himself, so I eventually gave him a blow job. Straight after that he said he had to go to dinner, so I went back home. I never thought much of it because I know he is not aware of what he had really done but I now realise (and probably always knew) that this is the problem, that it is rooted deep into boys minds from a young age that it is just normal. Boys/men/perpetrators - read, learn and do better.",,
"When I was 13 I was sexually assaulted by a student in a classroom who grabbed my crotch while laughing. I reported it to the school, and other students provided statements affirming that this happened. The student who did this faced no consequences, and I had to leave the school. I remember being in meetings where I was told it would make the school look bad if it got out, and realising that my right to have agency over my own body was less important to adults who were supposed to protect me that their reputation has scarred me for years.",,
"""I was groped in a hallway walking between classes when I was in year 9 or 10. I can't remember when, but I remember the hallway, the laughter, and the other boys who were daring him to do it. Assaulting me was a game, treating the least desirable girl as a sexual object, as if to give me some mock validation to make fun of me for. It was not, it was humiliating. I laughed along in the moment, and held his bag while I hit his shoulder (I hit the padded part of the strap of his bag, to protect his shoulder. I wanted to show some mock display of strength, but I felt too guilty to actually hurt him despite what he did to me), but I hated it. And the reason I didn't report it? My Mum shouted at me in the car for leaving a dish in my room. I thought she might yell at me more because of this, or accuse me of trying to change the subject. I was never brave enough to say it to anyone. This was not the first nor the last time- a boy I've known since I was four putting his hands on my waist and whispering dirty things in my ear in a science class while his clique laughed, hearing someone talk about how they'd fuck me to prove I was straight, and more. Never said a word. Nowadays, I suffer with OCD, and sexual triggers are some of the hardest to deal with, because they're the only ones that have been proved to be real.,To the survivors reading this, please know it is possible to know peace again. You will find people who respect your body and love you, who will ask, who will wait, who will see your trauma and love you in tandem with it, not in spite of it. We do not have to be strong and fierce warriors- it is enough to simply comfort yourself in your recovery. Treat yourself softly; you deserve to be.""",,
I had a guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] coerce me into giving him oral sex even though i had said multiple times “not tonight i wanna go home” he wouldnt take no for an answer and wouldnt let me leave the room so i ended up doing it after being heavily peer pressured. Multiple times i stopped and said “I dont wanna do this anymore” and he was like “i need to cum tho” i ended up pushing him away and I ran away. He texted me a week afterwards asking to have sex with me and he seemed confused when I told him to leave me alone and that I deserved an apology.,,
"One of my housemates invited a friend over for pres and then to go out clubbing with us. We made out in the club a bit and then decided to go home together. In the Uber back from the club I decided I didn’t want things to go further, but he didn’t be in a state to get home alone so I said he could stay over. He started kissing me again and I wasn’t really into it, but it just seemed easier to go along with it at the time. He then pushed me onto the bed and tried to undress me despite me telling him I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to take things further. He took my knickers off and pulled my tampon out and at this point I specifically told him to stop but he ignored me. He then forced himself inside me without a condom as I told him to get off and leave, but he wouldn’t stop until he passed out on top of me. I managed to wiggle out from underneath him, and when my housemates came home I made them help me dress him and take him home. My housemate got angry with me because they were friends, and I shouldn’t have brought him back and “encouraged” him.",,
"I was in a fwb situation with this guy I knew from work. I felt pretty comfortable with him and I would go back to his often after work. One time after we had had sex and I fell asleep, I woke up to him trying to penetrate me while I was sleeping. I kept on pretending to be asleep and turned over. It was only then that he stopped. The next morning after we woke up he said that during the night he woke up and we were having sex, seemingly brushing it off. I just laughed it off saying that that was weird, but I knew he wasn’t doing it in his sleep. I stopped sleeping with him pretty soon after that but he was being weird over snapchat so I just broke the fwb situation up. I hadn’t told anyone about it until I had a conversation with a friend and he said that it was rape. I hadn’t considered it until then, but now I look back it was.",,
"After being dumped by my boyfriend I went to a friend’s house party. His best friend was there and shared weed with me while I was already almost blacked out. I only remember some bits, of him begging to sleep with me while I kept saying no. He would not give up and ended up sticking his hand down my underwear. The next day, he kept telling me how ‚shit’ the party was and told everybody I assulted him. Everytime I think about it I get shaky and sick. I thought I was safe at that party as it was close friends only.",,
I came to a boarding school to have a place to feel like home because at that time I didn’t feel safe or comfortable in my house but soon after I arrived it was like everyone had agreed that i was going to be the target of all their harassments. They would grab me if i walked past them and make disgusting comments and remarks. They would ask me out as a joke which completely destroyed what little self esteem i had and now if anyone says anything nice to or about me at all i just assume they are lying and secretly hate me. They would expose themselves and when I reported it again and again i was told that there was no proof and that they never do it around teachers so i am probably makjng it out to be more than it was. was ELEVEN when this started and the one chance i had to feel truly safe and protected for the first time that i can remember and now i feel terrified whenever i pass them in the halls three years later even though they have dialled it down i still find it hilarious how when we have talks about sexual assault i have to sit there and listen to them talk about how they would never want thaf to happen and how the thought of it disgusts them when they have not yet taken responsibility for their own actions.,,

I was at a Halloween party and these boys from ucs were feeling me up and said I had to get with their friend but these two boys who went to city of London school saved me but I was so scared I didn’t get their names,,
"When I was 15 I went to a party with the people I used to dance with in ballet, some people I didn’t know who weren’t from ballet were also there. I was very drunk and a boy I didn’t know well, if at all, assaulted me in the room next door. I was scared of losing this person who I thought was now a big part of my life and proceeded to date him for 6 months, not telling anyone the truth, instead telling my friends I’d just had sex with someone once and that was it. Eventually, years later, it was too much but I felt like I’d left it too long to tell anyone and I’d dug myself into a hole too deep with how long I stayed with this boy that no one would understand. I never reported or did anything about it, I wish I had now but everytime I think about it I feel dead inside and I don’t have it in me to explain what happened in full to everyone around me who’d have to know. He no longer goes to this school that I’ve noted so I don’t know how helpful it is for this sort of system",,
"I would get a lift home from a male schoolfriend, who would force me into sexual activities as a form of repayment. If I said no, he would do it regardless but violently, so I would fear the word no and became passive towards him. He would try and get his friends to join in too. This went on for a couple of years. I was too afraid to tell anyone as I was worried to be seen as a slut or to be blamed, as he was one of the most liked boys in school.",,
A guy fingered me without consent in a nightclub at university. My friend tried to physically remove him from me and he still didn't stop. When we crossed paths at breakfast (in our halls of residence) the next morning he refused to meet my eye.,,

"On my first day in senior school, an older boy greeted me at the end of the corridor where his room was. Welcome to Ramsay House, he said, holding out his hand. I said thanks and shook his hand. When I took my hand away, it was covered with semen. It went downhill from there. I was marked as a lush and this gang of older boys had complete power over me. The teachers, mostly monks, couldn't have cared less. In fact, some of them took a salacious interest in what was going on. I wasn't the only one getting this abuse, either. That school was a sleazy place.",,
"Once my mum went over to her friends house and brought me with her cause her friend had a son who i hung out with, my mum ended up sleeping over so i did too.

"I’m now 32 but went to a co-Ed private boarding school in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. When we were 14 we went on a week long trip to the mountains in Italy and travelled by coach to get there and back. I sat at the back of the bus with the boys who I considered to be my best friends, it was me 5 boys and a female friend. When my female friend fell asleep the boys gang raped me at the back of the bus, using violence and fear to keep me from getting help from the 50+ Other students and teachers on the bus. It lasted over an hour. Each had their turn. After it had ended I went to the front of the coach and pretended to feel travel sick and the teacher presumed that because I was feeling this way and looking dishevelled it meant I had been drinking. I was banned from the first day of activities and they called my parents. I had marks around my neck which turned into bruises. No one ever stopped to ask me about this until I got home and my wonderful parents got me the help that I needed. We had no mobile phones to contact home with and I had to do team building activites with those boys all well. My female friend later told me she knew what was happening but was pretending to be asleep as she was scared. I forgave her immediately.",,

I had a boyfriend who would always try to have sex with me when I wasn’t in the mood or after a night out and was very drunk. He would get on top of me and I’d say no repeatedly and he would keep trying even if I was physically resisting as well. I would eventually give up tying and just lie there whilst he had sex with me. I thought this was normal as it happened so often and he was my boyfriend. But this behaviour is NOT okay.,,
"All not as important I guess but during my time at school there was more of an accumulation of smaller events. Boys making rape jokes, being taught you must wear shorts under your skirt, I was touched under the desk without consent during classes, I had someone put their hand up my skirt in the corridor, I was sexualised during classes paired with disgusting comments about my thighs or breasts, I have now been at university for two years but I feel that I will always carry it with me and it will always be how I will remember my school experience.",,
"While I was at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I had many unsettling and degrading experiences with boys. One in particular stands out. I was 15 and leaving a party and me and a friend who was staying with me decided to get a cab. a boy in our year (who was known was sending unsolicited pics and generally being aggressive and creepy) got into our cab. we got food in town and then started walking back to mine, assuming he would go to a bus stop. when he still wasn’t leaving we decided to stop for a bit in a park and while we were there he tried to cuddle up to me and put his arm around me. we left and started asking him when his bus was and he asked if he could come in to wait because there is a bus stop near my house. we reluctantly let him in and decided to make it clear we were going to bed. i remember putting spot cream on my face and wearing baggy clothes to hopefully put him off. me and my friend just got into bed and got as close as possible to each other on one side and pretended to sleep waiting for him to leave. he didn’t and eventually climbed into the bed and i felt his hand on my thigh and he tried to cuddle up to me again. we just stayed still and pretended to be asleep and passed out. in the morning he was gone and we joked about it but looking back it’s awful to think we were both so sure that we didn’t have the power to just ask him to leave.",,
"There was an incident involving 4 boys. 3 white boys in year 2 held down a black boy in reception. They held him against a wall and started repeatedly and forcefully kissing this boy on the mouth. He was crying and telling them to stop, but they didn't. The teachers were told, but nothing happened. The school told everyone who was involved not to say anything about it. No one was allowed to speak about it. This incident caused a lot of worry. Why would 6-7 years olds think that it was ok to hold down a child an kiss him on he mouth like that, especially because the reception boy was crying and telling them to stop and how would a 4-5 year old deal with this? The school cared more about keeping it quiet. That is wrong.",,
"I was laying with my best friend and her family friend on her bed and he just started touching me underneath the blanket he touched my butt, my thighs, and my vagina. I was uncomfortable so I tried to move and he wouldn’t let me",,

"My Daughter who had just turned 7 at the time got sat on, strangled and touch up her skirt by a boy in her class. The boy then ran and hid in a bush but as parents we got told that he wouldn’t of understood what he was doing, so why did he hide? This is a long line of sexual natured things this boy has done. We straight away got in contact with ‘MASH’ and they spoke with the school, nothing was done.",,
"When I was 14, I was sexually assaulted and harassed by a fellow student. It started with messages on Snapchat requesting nudes and asking me inappropriate questions and then he began touching me without my consent. He’d grope me and put his hand up my skirt. My friends recommended I start wearing trousers as if I was to blame, as if I was the one who needed to change my behaviour. This didn’t deter him, as he would put his hand down my trousers, only deterred by coming into contact with a sanitary pad, which I began wearing all the time in hopes it would gross him out to the point he’d stop. When I finally told my parents years later, my mum gaslit me, claiming as I wasn’t raped it wasn’t serious and I should just get over it, and my dad sympathised with the boy. I experienced two traumas with my assault, the initial assault and the incredibly damaging responses from my family and society. I’m now almost 19 and my assault still affects me every single day.",,
"I am a boy, and when i was in yr 6 i struggled with maths. My school recommended me to an outer school tutor ,which i did lessons with every weekend for a few months. We used to play games where he would make me match up cards across the table making be bend over to pick them up and slap my arse. He touched my arse a lot. eventually i told my parents so i stopped having lessons with this tutor. and the police got involved. It happens to 3 other boys too. It doesn't really affect me much but i want to spread awareness that sexual assault can happen to men too.",,
"This guy that was in my class would always ask me if he could sneak over, I kept telling him no but felt bad so I let him come one night. Before he came I asked what we were going to do and he said we were just gonna hang out and see what happens. All I wanted to do was just hangout and talk. So he came and I eventually learned that ""hangout"" was code for sex. I kept telling him no and to stop touching me and to leave, I even threatened to push him out the window but he was way stronger and got his way.",,
"""I was first sexually assaulted at age 15 by an 18-30s rep. He forced me to suck him off and then he made the coach leave without us so we had to pay for a taxi back. The day after he told my auntie that we had missed the coach to get us in trouble.,When I was 22 I was raped by a friend who was also a police officer. I was staying at his and I woke up to him having sex with me.,The last assault was when I was 24 when I woke up to a friend that I’d known since high school performing oral sex on me.,I’ve had endless amounts of occasions whereby I’ve been groped, catcalled, inappropriately touched on public transport, intimidated, mugged by a man with a knife, locked in a taxi (all by men) and so on.

"I invited a girl over to my house and sat down to watch a film with her. I wasn’t really feeling it so made an effort to make sure I gave off a vibe of just being interested in being friends. She didn’t get the message and began to grope me and feel my dick, after me trying to move away and feeling really uncomfortable she repeatedly tried to kiss me to which I moved my face away. After 4/5 times of me moving away she grabbed my face and went for it. It’s hard to speak about as I feel I will be shamed as a man for going through this.",,
"My first boyfriend was emotionally and sexually abusive on countless occasions. He raped me once violently and multiple times through constant manipulation. The violent time was at a party. We went into a bathroom together with the possibility of having sex in there. I was the most drunk I’d ever been and collapsed almost immediately. He denied that he was ever abusive and claims he never heard me saying no multiple times while shaking my head once we were there. He had said to me days before that he wanted to find out how drunk he could be and still finish. This is what he preceded to try and work out, while I could barely stand, and without wearing a condom. I’ve now had months of PTSD and anxiety therapy but still carry the fact that I couldn’t fight back even though I was screaming in my head to this day. He went so hard I was bleeding and it hurt to walk for days after. We didn’t break up for months after that and he would get annoyed and degrade me if I ever tried to speak up about it. I was later told by another boy who was at the party that everyone suspected he had taken advantage of me ‘and didn’t take our relationship seriously after that’. I think that shows the culture of victim blaming in schools currently and speaks volumes about the people who were vaguely aware and did NOTHING to help me. In the following months I lost a dangerous amount of weight and distanced myself from everyone in my life. I eventually realised the kind of person he was the last time we ever had sex, when he wanted to and I did not and he suggested we flip a coin. He won the bet and I still said no but eventually gave in. I know now that in no world was that consent. Consent cannot be given when ‘no’ is not a safe, viable option. The last thing I felt in that situation, and in many others with him, was safe. I broke up with him a week later.",,
"I moved in with a bunch of friends in first year at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We lived in the [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. One of my mates in the room next to me had been in a long term relationship. Her fella used to always be about our house. He seemed a really nice guy and devoted boyfriend. I had a lecture canceled early in the year and went home. When I went to my room I noticed my friend's bedroom door was missing the handle. It had been unscrewed and the handles were lying on the floor. I knocked and my mate cried out that she couldn't get out. I reassembled the door handle and opened the door to find my friend in tears and very distressed. Her and her fella had fallen out and he had taken the handles off the doors to lock her in. She admitted it had happened before but he knew everyones schedules so he always came back to let her out before we got home. She admitted that her fella had a posessive side and had done things like this before. I was furious. When he came by our house that evening I confronted him. He gaslit me and the rest of our housemates. Claimed I was lying and the next thing I knew my friend was backing up her abuser. I hated him. I messaged her brothers to warn them that their sister's fella was hurting her and abusive but they blew me off. They knew him, he was always good to her they said. Their sister was a bit high strung, I was blowing things our or proportion or making them up. They played football with their sister's boyfriend and he was a lovely guy. I was shouted down and ignored. About two week later I was home alone, or so I thought. My Friend's fella came into my room. When I asked what he was doing he said we had to talk. He threatened me to stay out of his relationship and 'stop spreading lies.' He pinned me to my bed and told me if I didn't stop telling people what he did then he would come back for another 'chat.' I knew exactly what he meant since he was grinding his disgusting arousal into me as he pinned me down. In the months that followed he turned my friends against me and continued to gaslight his girlfriend. She would confide in me when they had arguments, when he secretly hit her and she apologised for siding with him and lying to our other housemates. Then when her fella would reappear and they would make up she would turn on me again. I tried talking to a councilor in the student support centre but they couldn't really do anything. I asked if her course supervisor could be made aware of my concerns because I knew she was starting to miss class because of her fella's behavior. They refused. There was no support and no mechanisms to help or investigate. My university house had such a bad atmosphere and I was always afraid when he was around. I started commuting to University and lied to everyone that I was just homesick so I didn't have to explain what was really going on. I moved into a new house in second year and made new friends. I am still angry that I lost my childhood friends becuase of this guy and his abuse. I felt powerless to help my friend. I still feel a pit of dread and fear when I think of the day he cornered me and revulsion at the knowledge he would have raped me if I kept fighting him. He got off on the power. I am in my final year of undergraduate now and have heard that my ex-friend dropped out of university but is still with her abusive fella. I dread to think what is happening behind closed doors and hate myself that I was/am too scared to do more to help her.",,
"In my freshers week I went out with my friends and woke up the next morning with no recollection of how I had got back to my room. I woke up with no pants on, wet hair, vomit all over my room, large pain around my crotch area and frantically trying to piece together what had happened. I found out I was taken home by a complete stranger claiming to be my friend who had sex with me whilst I was blacked out and then put me in a shower after. I didn’t go into detail about what happened to my new uni friends as I was so embarrassed and thought no one would believe me. I decided to tell my mum 3 months after it happened and having to witness her reaction was probably the most heartbreaking part of the whole experience. The trauma sometimes isn’t the worst part - the aftermath, the paranoia, the reactions, the embarrassment. A year on and it still affects me everyday.",,
"On a field course with a group I had not worked with before, two students discussed whether or not they would 'fuck me' in a classroom where the only other person was one of the senior lecturers leading the course. There were only four people in the room. The lecturer was sat next to me going over the work, so if I could hear them, so could he. He said nothing. I was in total shock. Speaking to the three other women on the course, I was told this was standard and that on an earlier course the same lecturers played along with a (male) student game of 'female body part ' hangman. Months later I shared my experience with a female lecturer, who treated me as though I was hysterical. I never felt like I could follow through with a complaint against the lecturers facilitating such behaviour without threatening my future career, as the lecturers involved remain leaders in their field and involved in academia. The behaviour continued throughout my time there, creating a toxic environment and leaving many women on the course feeling violated and marginalised.",,
"We had regular socials with [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and one time I went into the bathroom stall with one of the boys who I fancied. We were kissing which is what I wanted but then he put his two hands on my shoulders and pushed me down the floor. I didn’t understand what was going on at first and was confused but then he pulled down his trousers, pulled down the toilet seat cover and sat down. He kept kissing me so I thought it was fine but then he pulled my head down and forced himself inside my mouth. I never said yes, I didn’t want to do this, and when I tried to pull away his hands gripped my head harder. All I wanted was just to kiss, I never said yes to anything more. I can still feel the wet and hard cubical floor on my knees and had to explain to my friends the next day that I went back to my room because I was just feeling sick. This was half true. I felt totally sick. For weeks after I got messages from boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] teasing me for giving head to someone sat on the toilet. It was traumatising.",,
I was abused on a train sexually and harassed for an hour long journey. This was 2 weeks ago and I’ve not been eating right since and i’ve relapsed with my self harm addiction that I was clean for 6 months prior,,
"He went to the same school as me. We started out being friends, he seemed a bit weird, but not dangerous or anything. One day he told me this weird secret about one of my best friends at the time. I thought it was wrong that he was spreading private information about her like that, so I told her. She immediately stopped talking to him. After I ""betrayed"" him, he didn't seem angry when I next saw him. That night we were in a theatre production together, we were standing in the wings, I was waiting to go on. I wasn't even looking in his direction, it was pitch dark and he kissed me. That's when it all started - yanking my hair in the corridor, pulling down the back of my skirt, touching my waist, my neck, my bum, pushing me around, hitting my abdomen and between my legs. The corridors became a place of fear for me, constantly looking for his bag or his hair so I could brace myself. I memorized his timetable, rather taking the long way round. On a school trip, he groped me, put his hands between my legs, and covered my mouth, so I wouldn't wake the others. I was frozen in fear. At the end of summer, I was beyond ashamed of my body. I hated my body for being weak, for not fighting. I started exercising, telling myself to do fifty more squats to ""prove my strength"" and when I came back to school I was anorexic. I thought it would stop. He cornered me in the corridors, stood outside my bathroom doors, mocked my anorexic body. The name of the school I've given ends with ""school for girls"". That's because the person that bullied me was actually a girl. He was a her. My best friend is friends with her. People at my school are friends with her. Rumors were spread about me at that time, and when they're brought up now people still say ""oh didn't you do [x] with her?"". People don't question them, and they even believe it was me that spread them. No one spoke up for me then, and I don't blame anyone for that. She left the school now but I just wish I didn't still have to deal with the threat that she could still be invited to a party by my friend, she could even be invited to my prom. I am not even sure myself if it was sexual assault, since people seem to think ""oh but it was a girl"", but I know that girl is a bully. The fact that she is still friends with so many people I know terrifies me.",,
"It was after my parents’ divorce in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was around 4 years old and just starting to speak more clearly. After the divorce my father lived in an apartment close to a family friend (who lived in the same apartment complex). That family friend had dated a man named [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], who even after the break up- stayed close with my family. While my sister and I took a nap in the living room of the family friend’s apartment- [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] kept the bedroom door open as he touched himself. I went up to use the bathroom and he followed me inside. Later on, unsure if it was the same day- he watched me take a shower. I told my mother not too long after and she took it to the police. I told them all that I remembered while my dad and his friends tried convincing me that I was lying. They still think to this day I was lying, however I think they know the truth, but they don’t care.",,
"Last year my boyfriend assaulted me regularly. He would finger me and touch my body whenever and wherever he wanted, sometimes he would make me touch him but not so much. I never felt safe around him but i was too scared to leave the relationship. Him and his friends would joke about what happened to me and slut shame me openly with people who didn’t even know me. I only found out 6 months later they all knew and that i was the laughing stock of their group, they used to joke about me when i was right next to them like i didn’t even matter. I hid in the toilets because i would too scared to face them and him. Every time i see him i throw up all i can think of is how much he has messed up my life.",,
"""This topic blowing up all over social media the past couple days is a constant reminder of when I was raped. I was 15, I had been drinking at a friends house a 20 min walk from my own. When I decided to head home a friend offered to walk me. I gladly accepted feeling that I would be safer that way. In a bus stop around the corner from my home he began taking advantage of me. I still remember the feeling of my body pressed against the gravel floor as he pushed his way inside of me. My reaction was to go numb and accept the painful experience instead of screaming and fighting. Due to this I convinced myself for 5 years that it wasn’t rape. Even though I never spent any time around him from then on and got scared every time I bumped into him. I still convinced myself that if it was rape I should have been screaming NO. Now I know what consent really is, I understand that I did not consent to this sexual experience.,""I got drunk at a party and I was assaulted by a close male friend whom I had really trusted. I made it clear I wasn’t interested in him and I was crying as he did it. When I tried to check my phone (to text my boyfriend for help), he stopped and said I was too drunk. When I tried to leave the room, he pulled my legs over his lap so I couldn’t leave. Once another girl came in, he finally let me leave. I went to the bathroom and called my boyfriend and he stood outside the door the whole time. Then he tried to stop me from talking to my friends without him there. I reported it to the police the next day. In the following weeks, school counsellors made me feel terrible for reporting it and told me to think about how he must be feeling and the school told me that I couldn’t tell my teachers in order to protect HIM.",,
I left [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in 2019 however from 2015 to 2019 I was repeatedly sexually harassed at school infront of many students and staff members by a few of my fellow classmates. Innapropriate comments were constantly made about my appearance. I was very obviously uncomfortable with the situation and because it was brushed off with a light ‘stop messing around’ by my teachers nothing was ever done to support me. I witnessed another girl being harassed and when she got the courage to defend herself against the disgusting comments she was punished for shouting at the boy and he was not punished at all.The sight of the boys who made the comments about me and my body made me panic and I believe is what started my anxiety disorder. I have many self image issues which I believe arose from being oversexualised from such a young age. I know similar things happened to lots of other girls at the school and I feel for the current students as I hope this doesn’t happen so openly to them.,,
I was walking down the halls of my school and I went to my locker to get my bag to go home. A kid named [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] slapped my ass as he passed by. He has done this twice now and has not said sorry nor has the school done anything about it.,,
"When I was 16 I went to a dinner party and met a man who was 50, he offered me £250 and asked to take me on a date to a very expensive restaurant. He said he wanted to get me pregnant. He put his hand on my leg and kept stroking it. I think he realised how bad it was because at the end he said I shouldn’t listen to the me too movement and that he was different.",,
"I was in year 6 at the time and she was year 9/10. We was having sex quite often and I thought it was consentual but as I got older, I realised that I was being groomed by a teenager when I was a child. It carried on from when I was in year 6 up until I was in year 8. After that, I got with a boy who later hit me and raped me multiple times from the same school (we was in the same year). Upon all of this, I was molested by a family friend when I was 7 (he was 19). I told very few people and only this year, I'm getting support from different services. I am a survivor.",,
I would be touched by a girl under the desk on my legs and thighs inappropriatly,,
"A friend's flatmate, a former friend, was overly forward in her pursuit of me in my first year ot uni. I felt like I couldn't say anything, which meant the situation escalated with the rest of our friends believing that I was exaggerating her pursuit of me. It all culminated on a night where I'd bought myself a bottle of whiskey, and as I began to drink at their flat, she began to proposition me. I told her no time and time again as she continued to ask me to come to her room with her. As time progressed and my drunkenness increased, I became increasingly frustrated by her persistence. I snapped after drinking the whole bottle and distinctly remember thinking ""if i have sex with her she'll leave me alone"". We had sex. I still don't know how to feel, I made the choice to have sex at the end of the day, but I can't escape the feeling that if it had been the other way I'd be serving time.",,
"He was a teenager and I’m a kid. I remember that he started mocking and hating the house i built on Minecraft and then he said he can make me a better house in the game, BUT if only I touch his male parts. I got scared and never held a penis before. Me as a naive kid. I touched it until he forces me to give him a handjob. I removed my hand immediately and he threatened me that he would not finish building the house and I’m now forever traumatized. My tip is BE AWARE and KEEP YOURSELF IN CONTROL",,
"When I was in Year 9, a boy in my maths class who had a 'crush' on me would constantly touch my legs and inner thighs. I remember moving slightly away and telling him to stop, but he wouldn't. I was fully covered + wearing a headscarf. Proof that clothes really aren't, and never were, the issue.",,
"I was on a second date with someone I’d met online. We started having sex but I didn’t rlly want to. so i told him to stop. he did stop for 10 seconds, and then started having sex with me again, and held me down while i cried. i told him to stop again, and he did, but started groping me instead and started fingering me while I cried and I tried to squeeze my legs together so he couldn’t. I managed to leave before anything worse happened. I threw up on the street as soon as I left.",,
I was 18 and just about to go to uni. Me and a few of my friends went to the local pub to have one last drink before leaving. I was there a few pints deep and the best friend of my boyfriend came over to say hi. We chatted and drank for about an hour or so when suddenly he got very handsy. I tried to move away but he kept grabbing my and pulling me back. We were pressed into a booth and he started to move his hand up my skirt grabbing trying to finger me. I spent an hour pushing his hand away under the table. I felt frozen I couldn’t speak out as it would cause a scene. Eventually we left me and the friends I came with. The next day I told my boyfriend about it and he refused to believe me. He accused me of leading him on and saying his mate wouldn’t do that. A year later my boyfriend made a film using my experience. I’m still with him I can’t leave it feels like we moved in together and he only recently showed me the film.,,
2 years ago i was grabbed and as the man was dragging me away i tried to break free but he put his hand down my pants and started touching me it lasted for about a minute i think but i havent told anyone because im scared that people will think im faking it because it happened 2 years ago and i didnt tell anyone because i was ashamed,,
"Started in year 7 when this one boy who I would sit next to in pretty much all my lessons would just be a typical teenage boy, you know talking about sex and things like that which never bothered me, but it’s when he started constantly snap chatting me trying to get me to send him pictures of me doing things that a girl in year 7/8 should not be sending a boy that they’re not with. Anyway he would just send unwanted pictures of his private parts and send videos and it made me so uncomfortable and I never told anybody because if it came out, of course the girl would be bullied for it and be called a slag or something like that. But From what I can remember he started inappropriately touching my legs and parts he should not be touching especially in a school environment and For school I would wear a skirt and pretty much every lesson we were in together he would touch/feel my lower section and if we were walking up the stairs he would lift up my skirt and everybody on the stairs would see, it was horrible. There was even a time when I was in an English lesson in year 10 and where I sat was pretty much right in front of the teachers desk with this boy and another boy, we were watching a film or something and the boy starts feeling up under my skirt and the teacher literally saw him do it and then looked me dead in my eyes and did nothing or didn’t say anything and he could see how uncomfortable I was!! I kept telling him no time and time again but he still did those things and felt no shame, it’s angers me that boys get away with it or it’s just ‘boys being boys’ it’s wrong",,
"This one I didn’t realised was assault until I told my friend what I thought was a funny story. I then heard myself and felt stupid and guilty for not realising. It was four years ago, I was 14. It was London pride and as you may know it’s common for people to stop and chat. I was walking along one of the main, jammed pack roads and a man stopped me in the middle of the pavement. He complimented my nose and I thought he was another ally/member of the community just chatting on a day which is for building connections with others. I thanks him and laughed, he then proceeded to tell me he is going to “kiss me nose now”, he then did and I froze with fear. He was probably around 25. He then tightened his grip on my upper arms and kisses me on the lips. I remember my lips receding into my mouth. He then pulled away and asked for my number. Blind with shock and fear, I went along and was about to give him a fake number as that what my mum had told me to do when in this situation. However he said to not to try that as he will phone the number instantly to check. I have him a fake name and my real number, he phone it my number to check. I then said my friends waiting and left. I met my friend and told her laughing. She then hugged me tight and apologise, I don’t know what for then I realised what had happened. I have countless other stories from being catcalled in my school uniform to be called a whore in front of my all male computing class whilst the teacher laughed along. Thank you for reading and let’s start a change for a safer world.",,
"When I was in Year 10 i was stood on the schools football area. It was non uniform and i was in jeans and a shirt like everyone else. Out of nowhere someone came and slapped my bum, i didn’t know the person who did it but him and his friends stood there and laughed whilst i froze in utter shock. He then said he ‘slipped’ but it wasn’t a slip as i literally saw his shadow walking towards me, not thinking any of it at the time. after all we’re in a school environment and things like that should not happen but it did. I stood there humiliated and scared afterwards.",,
"[date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], one of my family members had asked us to hang out with one of their friends. That friend had a niece. i was with my cousin and the niece forced me to do unspeakable thing to myself, I at that time being only 10 Had no clue what i had been forced to do. if only i had told this to someone maybe i would be out of this pain. i feel disgusted with my self. and it’s also now that i realized i have been groomed online aswell. i hate myself.",,
"I left secondary school in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], but there was a teacher at our school in his 30's having sex with 3 school girls (that I am aware of). We were sexually harassed and assaulted by the boys daily (we didn't know it was actually quite serious sexual assault by todays standards). I was on crutches once when I was 13, walking home with a boy who was 12 and he pushed me down and masturbated over me whilst trying to pull my top up and my trousers down. I walked home covered in his fluids and called my friend, who laughed and said it was embarrassing because he was younger than me. I never told anybody else, never mentioned it to the boy who did it. There was a very serious culture of rape at the school. I would like to name the school, but privately?",,
"it was during my relationship, he pressured me into having sex with him, got angry when i said no.",,
When I was in year 8 my friend and I revived rape threats over an insta DM from a random account. Still to this day u have no idea who it was but they displayed a very intimate knowledge of private conversations that we had had a few weeks before so they must have known us well. Could even name songs that we were listening to and named this in the message telling us that next time he would get me when I was walking home. I was 13.,,
"it was october 16,2020 before a football game. my boyfriend at the time couldn’t wait any longer. so he held me against the wall at a park next to my school with me screaming nd crying me he wouldn’t stop til he was satisfied. thats the only thing he made the relationship about. then after we broke up he would still force me to do stuff no matter how many times i said no during school.",,
"This is a small thing I only realised came under harassment recently. I was at a friend’s house and a boy thought it was okay to put his hand on the small of my back because I was gay? I knew how uncomfortable I felt at the time but I froze and my heart was racing. I didn’t feel safe after that point. It seemed at the time that what he was saying was logical and I shouldn’t feel any way towards him touching me as I wasn’t attracted to men. Everytime I think about it, it grosses me out.",,
"I was sexually abused at the age of 9 for a year by a family-friend who was a teenager at the time. My experience is now 15 years ago and I’m only just seeking therapy for (what I didn’t know until now) is PTSD. I gave a statement to the police when I turned 10 and my mum found out. The case was taken no further - for the reason I can only assume was that I was unable to articulate at that age how to express that I was sexually abused. We are never taught how to if it does happen. We aren’t taught the correct names of our genitals to explain. We’re told to use words like ‘he touched my cookie’ or ‘flower’. I was given no counselling or therapy so nobody in my family knew how much I was affected. 9 years later my perpetrator came to live with us again because he became homeless. Nobody knew I was affected by the childhood experience so I had to agree to it to save having to explain to my younger brother why my perpetrator couldn’t come and stay with us (who doesn’t know what happened). 15 years later and I’m now telling my story. I’m now sick and tired of living in fear. Every day my brain staying in panic / survival mode whenever another male is in sight. Something needs to be done in schools / for children at an early age because nobody should have to seek therapy all because another person didn’t seek therapy earlier on, and decided to inflict their issues onto you.",,
I went to the cinema with a boy who i met for the first time and he put his hands down my trousers when i made it quite clear i didn’t want that. he also emotionally abused me for the whole relationship and many months after as we were still “friends”. he’d say he was going to kill himself if i wasn’t friends with him and that i told him to kill himself as well. he’d say things like my skirt was too short and constantly call me a slag/slut/sket ect,,
i was pushed around and harassed to pull my pants down i didnt want to they hurt me in a corner at recess. it wasnt fun,,
"One of the male students in my year touched me. He told me if I did anything, he will hurt me in every way he could. He touched on my arm, my legs and up my thighs. I tried to break free from his arms but he pulled me in closer and continued to touch my waist and up to my breasts, I was frozen in horror. I thought I knew him. I managed to get away without being hurt. As soon as I got home, I told my mother and my mother told the school. The school said they will discipline him but they never did as far as I know. I’ve since moved schools but he’s joining my school and I’m afraid he will do it again.",,
This wasn’t that long ago. I was in a friendship of three there wasn’t much drama but one day one of my friends started touching my other friend and I in the wrong places to the point where she would go to the bathroom after I of my other friend went in and she would touch us or make me touch her ( keep in mind this all happened at school where people could see) I told my old next door neighbours and they told my mum and my mum told the school ( i didn’t know they told me my mum and she told the headmistress). But then months later it came rushing to my head and I had a mini mental break down realising what had properly happened. I told my too friends at the time what happened sand they instructed me to tell my teacher because it was messed up. I was in the cloakroom before my next lesson my friends were with me the teacher walked in and I told my teacher what happened then the deputy head got involved and so did the headmistress. She thankfully got what she deserved.,,
Was groaped by a male student and touched sexually...,,
"I was hanging out with my boyfriend, two of my best friends and this other boy and his little brother. When me and the other boy walked into a corner shop some boys walked past and said to him that i had ‘bunda’ which really freaked me out. Later, The other boy and his brother kept saying to me that i had ‘bunda’ and I felt so uncomfortable. None of my friends or my boyfriend did anything about it for me.",,
"When I was 18, I went out with some friends and my boyfriend of the time in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We were in an LGBTQ club, just dancing. A guy came over and started dancing with me, which I was ok with, I felt safe in that environment and with my friends. He then put his hand up my skirt and I pulled away from him and explained I had a boyfriend, who I pointed to. He then apologised to my boyfriend (not me). I don’t know why at the time me having a boyfriend was the reason he shouldn’t have done it, and not that it was sexual harassment.",,
He used me while getting me high. He messed with my emotional and mental stability while taking advantage of me.,,
I was told a guy wanked to my tiktoks. i was in year 8 and had no idea that it wasn’t ok. neither did any of friends. nevertheless i felt extremely uncomfortable. i asked they guy who had told me (my boyfriend at the time and the other guys best friend) to ask him to stop. i don’t know if he did - it didn’t seem to matter very much to him. i made excuses for him like ‘it’s cause he likes u’ and ‘he’s actually a really nice guy’ even ‘u did chose to post that’ . i still feel so ashamed of myself when i think of it (even tho i know i shouldn’t). i even feel like this when i see him at school.,,
"When I was too young to understand what relationships were I remember having a friend who was a girl . I was 8 when she was about 12 and she told me kissing was a normal thing with girls I remember whenever I would go to her house and leave she would make me kiss her on the lips for a few minutes . I never knew it was wrong until I learned what consent and assault is and she got away with it as well ."",It's been a few years since I left secondary school and I can only hope things have changed for the better, though I doubt they have.",,
"Whilst at university, after a night out I was offered a lift home with a friend and his friends. I liked one of them and was offered to sleep in his bed. He started taking his trousers off and I repeated said stop!! Although I liked him, it was not my intention to sleep with him. When I tried to get away he trapped me. I was so scared and following the rape I was so ashamed and blamed myself for liking him that I never told anyone.,After he fell asleep I called a taxi and went home.",,
When I was in year 4/5/6 this boy from my class would touch me everywhere and Used to lift my skirt up touch me in my private areas and put his hand up my back I felt really uncomfortable and was too scared to tell anyone because I didn’t really know what to do and when I would tell him to stop he’d just keep doing it and this carried on until the end of primary school and I think that it’s disgusting because of what mindset he had at that age we we’re probably around 9 years old,,
"our pe teacher (female) told every girl that she needed to wear tracksuit bottoms in the 30 degree heat, and that if we didn’t our skorts (designed by the school) would be “too destructive to the male teachers and boys learning experience” not one of the boys/male teachers were spoken to. now all of the girls are scared to go near the male teachers and we’ve had to make sure that the boys can “control their eyes”.",,
i showed him my self harm scars because i trusted him and what he does an hour later is to sexually assault me. after i got home that night i didn’t even realise what had happened. it’s been two years and I still feel unsafe with him but everyone of my friends know nothing and the two who do don’t even do anything. they still treat him with respect and most probably enjoys his company more than mine (i’m friends with all of them) - one person even went to show her appreciation for him in a post. it really fucked me up.,,
"A close male friend would manipulate me regularly into letting him stay with me or getting me to stay with him. He had a lot of mental health issues and would use this aswell as encouraging me to drink a lot to get his way. I was new to the friendship group and didn’t want to cause problems. Even when I would say I didn’t want anything to happen, he would touch me when I was trying to sleep, a lot of the time I did not have the fight in me to stop him. He took pictures of me and showed them to other people in the friendship group when I tried to complain to a friend she dismissed that it’s just how he is. It was really messed up but he’s still in the friendship group and close to my now boyfriend and I just haven’t done anything about it. I am so ashamed of myself.",,
"I was 9 or 10, in year 5 at primary school. Everyone was working quietly and I got up to go and get something from the other side of the room. A boy stood up as I passed him and grabbed my (almost non existent) breasts, one in each hand, and squeezed them. All of the other children laughed. The teacher told us both to stop being silly.",,
"When i was 13 i was groomed for 9 months by a 28 year old. It started just before the first lockdown when I went to an aviation experience and was told of an aviation ‘influencer’ to follow. I did so and within moments he messaged me. We chatted about general things mainly about aviation as it was my passion, but once lockdown came around the conversation turned, and as the months went on it went from talking about aeroplanes to forcing me to send photos/videos myself and him sending me photos/videos/voice massages/facetiming me of him w******. This went on for months until eventually he followed abs stalked me to my school one day. It was the scariest moment of my life and i had, had enough of the sexual abuse. So i decided to report him to my school and the police. After months of investigation work there was not enough evidence for a criminal charge so he walks a free man today. I am suspecting of someone else who may have gone through the same thing as I with him, and i am hoping/praying that he will come forward. But until that day he’s a free man so please be so careful. I never want anyone else to have to go through this and if you do please remember it’s not your fault and you are loved <3",,
"When I was a child, me and several other children, including my older sister, were molested by a member of the church we all went to. I'm not going to say which one because of how well known I and my family are in it, even though I haven't gone in years. I don't know how old I was because of trauma. I now have a really bad memory. He would pretend to tickle us. At first, it started out innocent. Actual tickling. But after a couple of weeks, he got bold. He would touch us every where. This all happened while we were in the chapel, surrounded by adults who knew 100% what was happening. I was his favorite. My and my sister were the 2 oldest kids. We didn't know exactly what he was doing because of how young we were. We just knew that we didn't like it and didn't want to be around him. Our grandparents (my parents aren't religious but we were required to go to church every weekend that we stayed at our grandparents' house) would usher us over to him, knowing what was about to happen. We'd fight it, try to say that we didn't like it or that we wanted to stay with them but they wouldn't listen. There were 2 bathrooms in the church, one further back near the classrooms and one at the front. I always used the one in the back so that I wouldn't have to walk in front of everyone. One day, he followed me into the bathroom and locked the door. I can't remember any of it. I just remember all the blood. I just cleaned up and went back out to the chapel. I never told anyone. To be frank, I couldn't remember up until a few years ago. The man ended up dying from a heart attack. My grandparents sent me an invite to his funeral. I was so tempted to go just so I could see his dead body. A boy who was also one of his victims ended up dying in a car crash. Everyone says it was an accident but I think it may have been a suicide. He was only 18.",,
"There was a boy in 6th grade that grabbed my ass. He told me it was a joke. He did the same thing to one of my friends. The next year one of his friends asked him about it and all he said was that it was ""juicy"". The same friend that asked abt it, pressured me into sending nude photos. And pressured me into performing oral sex on him. I told him no several times, but he begged and begged until I complied. I wouldn't have done any of what I did with him if he took no for an answer. He also shared nude photos of another friend of mine to all the boys in the grade.",,
I was blackmailed into sending nudes to someone online when I was 14. The thought of getting help or telling someone from school never occurred to me because I knew I would get in trouble. I would come home and cry in my bathroom after school for a few days after it happened and I never said a word to anyone.,,
"When I was in s1 I was sexually assaulted by a boy in my school and nobody takes it seriously, I have struggled with sexual assault in the past by others but this specific boy has done it before and gets away with it.",,
"When I was 18 I went to a bar with a friend of mine, these two guys sitting on the table next to us kept trying at any opportunity to talk to us and eventually we started chatting, I remember him asking for my name which he kept forgetting so eventually I turned it into a joke and told him I wasn’t telling him my name again, my friend went to the bathroom and the other guy went outside so I was alone with one of them, he kept moving closer and begging me to tell him my name being super flirty, When I wouldn’t tell him he started getting annoyed and rude so I made some comment about his attitude changing as soon as he realised I wasn’t interested. He then proceeded to make countless remarks like “why the fuck would I sleep with you” and many comments about me being ugly, he completely switched. his friend came back inside and at this point I was shaking with nerves, his friend tried to get him to leave but he was still verbally abusing me, they then got up to leave in a hurry and STOLE MY BAG as they left, I never felt like it was that bad until I read what I just wrote, no matter how small you think it was, if it upset you or made you feel uncomfortable it’s not ok.",,
I went on a tinder date and was spiked. Woke up to find myself naked in his bed. No memory between that first drink and the next morning. He said ‘but you were up for it’.,,
"I was 14 and he was 18. I didn’t know him before that night. He plied me with alcohol at a party, led me away from the main room and proceeded to assault me. I blacked out so I don’t know exactly what he did to me. I contracted herpes that night.",,
Well I was sexual assaulted by my brother 5 years ago and he would always bring me behind trees and do stuff with me and in my bed room and he would blame stuff on me for things I didn't do. Every time I would say I didn't do anything they wouldn't do anything but put me in the corner and same with him,,
A boy grabbed my butt multiple times and the school only gave him an after school detention.,,
"me and my girlfriend were at a friends gathering one night. im never the type of girl to get extremely drunk, but my girlfriend at the time was and she was very very drunk this particular night (doesnt excuse it). she sexually coerced me a lot before this incident looking back on it so this shouldn't have been a surprise to me looking back at the nature of our relationship. as i said she was very drunk and i was in my friends bedroom alone trying to calm down after a panic attack (i dont like social situations much; my girlfriend knew this). she walked in as i expressed how i was feeling to her she told me i would ""feel better soon"" as she moved her hand towards my ass and grabbed it. i was immediately uncomfortable and said i was upset and exhausted and didnt want to do anything and she said i wouldnt have to worry. she then started giving me w hickey and i immediately felt uncomfy and said no. she then covered my mouth with one hand and held my hands down at the wrist with another. i probably couldve been strong enough to get her off but i felt frozen and after i just zoned out and couldnt move. she raped me. after when im guessing she just got bored or fed up and went to find everyone else, i went straight to the bathroom and cried for half an hour until one of my friends came to find me and i said id been crying over an argument between me and my girlfriend. i didnt tell anyone for months and even to her i pretended it didnt happen for such a long time. the day after i had bruises on my neck where i had been strangled and i had fingernail marks left in my wrists from where she had held me down. i stored it away in a box in my mind for so long because i was so scared of what would happen if i told anyone as we always had such a close friendship group and a lot of my friends were also her friends. i stayed with her for two months after this happened and when we broke up that little box in my head i stored it all away in just opened and it made me open my eyes to what a horrible person she really was.",,
"Statutory rape at 14, he said if I didn’t have sex with him it means I don’t love him",,
"Seeing these stories has made me address situations that happened over ten years ago that I always felt ashamed of, but now realise were not a normal part of growing up. There are so many instances I can think of perpetrated by boys from [school names omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], but the most traumatising was when (at 13) I was coerced into giving a Highgate boy a blow job the day after kissing his friend. The next day I received messages from both saying what a slut I was. Years later he brought it up with me in front of people to try and humiliate me, as if it was my decision. This is systemic and must end.",,
I was abused on the tube when I was 13 in a crowded carriage. It was obvious what he was doing and no one did anything to help.,,
"I was raped hundreds of times by a much older man, including occasions where I was sleeping between the ages of 15 and 16. This was known but brushed off. A few years after a guy I went on a date with coerced me into walking down an alleyway and sitting in an old door way because it was raining. He forced me to sit on his knee even though I’d declined a few times and when another man walked past and asked if I was alright, the guy I was on a date with held me tighter and butted in when I tried to reply. After this I dragged myself off his knee to get away with out causing a fuss and he repeatedly grabbed my wrist and tried to put my hand on his penis but I pulled away Everytime. I felt extremely trapped and ended up dating this guy for months because everytime I tried to leave he gaslit me and would also hurt himself. When I tried to tell him I didn’t want to have sex with him because of my past he told me I was awful for giving him mixed signals (I hadn’t) and coerced me into sleeping with him. This story is unfortunately not uncommon.",,
"All through my life, from preadolescence to late sixties, I have had repeated abuse from workmen on the street, coming down the Tube behind me, from colleagues grabbing me to force physical contact, and rape. Now 80 thank goodness not for a long while, but now of course, nervous about going down an alleyway between streets in my market town home, or walking along a quiet street after an evening meeting, sometimes with keys in my fist. I strongly suspect a number of my friends have had sex forced upon them, as happened to me in my 20s, and again in my 40s.Even in my 60s and early 70s I had a male friend who never accepted that I absolutely did not want to be grabbed and kissed on the mouth. It might sound ridiculous, not being 'grateful' for being embraced-but having no feeling of desire or love towards him made this repellent-and, eventually, I discontinued the connection with him. That may solve a directly personal problem, but the street anxiety and the worry if there's a late evening knock on the door persists. I fear I'm telling the history of everywoman. How do we change the 'male dominance' behaviour? Good luck and great start, opening this line of communication.",,
"From the age 8-12 i was repeatedly raped and molested for years by my brother not only that he did that he also abused me mentally, emotionally, physically",,
"When I was in year 1 or 2, a group of older boys would take me to the corner of the playground frequently and tell me to pull up my skirt. I did it because I was a naive kid. I remember my friends seeing and I was really embarrassed, like it was something I had done wrong. One day an older girl saw and told a teacher. The next day there was an assembly where this girl was rewarded for being brave, for telling a teacher when bad things were happening (they didn't say what). I guess they must have talked to the boys because it never happened again, but not a single teacher talked to me. I was given no support, nothing to tell me that it wasn't my fault. I believed this until I was an adult.",,
"I found nudes of 3 different girls on my exs phone while we were still dating, they were past girlfriends and he’d saved them on a folder on his phone without their consent (some dated back to 2-3 years prior so they would have been from when they were 14/15). I had already sent him pics (not full nude thank god) and found that he had screenshotted them off Snapchat. He acted surprised and got extremely defensive saying he’d never seen them before etc. when I asked him why he had a folder full of them on his camera roll with mine and several other girls pictures in it...",,
"I was only 6. One boy would always grab me and push my back onto a wall that only went up to my hips and would always try to force a kiss on me, I would bend back as far as I could to stay away but then he would rub his privates onto mine. I told a teacher, they told me he just likes me and that boys would be boys.",,
"In the year 2018, I remember this boy who i thought was good for me, came up to me and touched my bum at the time i thoght it was cute but it turns out he was going to rape me but i told a teacher that got me sent home and i had to go into a Physik ward becuse i wanted to kms",,
"I received non consensual explicit images from many boys at my school, some older than me, from the age of 12. i grew up thinking that this was normal and never told anybody. later on when i was 15, i was raped by a boy who i thought was my friend in my own home. after telling him to stop repeatedly. i had to see him every day until i finished school. i was terrified every time i saw him. rumours about it spread around the school and i was faced with victim blaming and disbelief. i then suffered with mental health issues and told the school about this, and they said they can’t help me and that i just need to sort out my behaviour and attendance and get the best grades possible. i had friends that helped me when they shouldn’t have had to do. rape culture shouldn’t exist in schools. i was exposed to something at such a young age that i was not ready for and it’s scarred me for life.",,
"When I was 13 years old, I would switch between taking my school bus and the public bus to get back home after school (because the public bus was cheaper). I had to take 2 buses, one heading to the bus station which had plenty of other school kids on, and the second took me to the end of my road and I was the only school kid on there. One afternoon, I got on the 2nd bus (where I was the only school kid) and a few minutes later, a guy who looked to be in his 60's sat in the wheelchair seat directly across from me. As soon as the bus doors closed and the bus began pulling out of the station, the guy started smiling at me and wouldn't take his eyes off me for the next 10 minutes. A little while later, he very openly bent down to the side, and when I followed his line of sight, I saw he was looking straight up my skirt. Bearing in mind I was in school uniform (and I am a very modest person), the school skirt I was wearing was covering my knees. I explicitly remember getting all tensed up, looking out of the window and trying to cover my knees more, but he continued to bend to the side and look up my skirt. I was petrified and my mind was screaming at me to do something, but I couldn't physically move. This happened for about 10 more minutes before a guy walked up to the front of the bus and asked the guy in front of me where he was from. He then proceeded to raise his voice, turn to me a softly ask if the guy was bothering me. On instinct, I shook my head (which I still regret deeply) and the man trying to help looked really embarrassed and walked off the bus. A few minutes later, I got off the bus myself and quickly got home. I told my parents about the incident, but it seemed as if they completely forgot about it within the next 10 minutes. Around a month later, I found out he actually lived in the same area as me, and I see him walking up and down the street regularly. Even though this incident occurred 1 year and 9 months ago, I still have panic attacks when I am reminded of it, and I can no longer get on a public bus.",,
"My idea of how girls should be treated was completely distorted by going to a London private school.,The rape culture followed you everywhere, from the streets to social-media to home, even though I went to an all-girls school.,We were/are treated like toys, but it was “normal” behaviour that you would’ve been deemed weird, frigid, difficult or overly-sensitive/emotional to question.,At party’s or “gatherings”, all the boys would sit around waiting for girls to come and present themselves to them, literally. But the worst part was, girls would think that they would need to! Increasingly, 11/12 year old girls would show up to party’s wearing as little as possible, not for themselves, but because they thought it would be the only way guys would find them desirable.,The toxic attitude that so many boys had and the disrespect toward young girls manifested itself in our brains too. As a result, girls started objectifying other girls and taking on the same attitude as the boys, even me, and this was probably the scariest thing looking back.,The first time I was sexually assaulted was when I was 11 years old. I was with a group of people, one of them being a very popular, good looking guy who went to The Hall. I was sat next to him and he would not stop asking me to “get with” him. No matter how much I resisted or showed I was uncomfortable, he kept pushing, until we eventually got with and I was expected to feel proud. I was expected to want it.,I saw him at a party a week later and the same thing happened. No matter how much I said I wasn’t in the mood or wasn’t comfortable he kept pushing until I found myself being pushed up against a concrete wall and submitting to his pressures.,I submitted because I didn’t want to make a scene. Because I didn’t want to be difficult. Because no one cared that I was uncomfortable so why should I?,Didn’t question it once.,The second time I was sexually assaulted was far worse. It was in the summer before I was about to enter year 8, and I had agreed to meet up with a guy I knew. I’d met up with him before in the past, and I suppose you could say we were friends. I had never been fingered before. No matter how much I resisted or expressed a discomfort, I eventually was in the position where I had to just hold my breath, bite my lip and accept that it was going to be something I’d have to endure. After it happened what was going through my head was “at least it didn’t hurt, could’ve been worse”.,But it didn’t stop there. The guy then persuaded me to come to his house, where his parents were not. “It’s only about a mile from your house I promise”, “It’s in X area I swear, so close” is what he said to convince my naive 12 year old self to come with him. Once there, I suggested we watch a movie so that we wouldn’t have to talk really, and 0.3 second into the movie, literally, he was already on top of me, giving me no out.,I knew where it was going but I didn’t feel like I had a voice to speak up. My phone then buzzed and I took it as an opportunity to escape. I pretended my mum called and was out the door, sprinting down the street within the next minute. I was in an area I didn’t know, I had no money, no Oyster card, and my phone was on 1%. I looked on snap maps and saw that a friend of mine was nearby so I called him and he let me sort of “take refuge” at his house.,He made me pasta, we played ping pong, and I thought of him as a real friend.. until the following week when I saw him at a party and he said to me “don’t lie, you only made up that whole story about the guy so you could get some of this”, gesturing to his dick. It only reinforced my feeling that what happened to me wasn’t real and wasn’t an actual problem. It reinforced the culture that taught me time and time again that these things that happened to me were insignificant, and petty of me to question.,The next time I was sexually assaulted was when I was 13, and the most heartbreaking thing was that when I tried to reach out and discuss the following events with the guy who did it to me.. he claims to not even remember. And again, I felt insignificant and stupid.,He was my first ever boyfriend, [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] kid (a school that was host to almost all my perpetrators), and I was so excited to have a boyfriend! After about two weeks of us dating, he texted me saying “my friends keep asking me when you’re going to give me head”. I replied, making it extremely clear that I was “not comfortable” doing that yet and he expressed an understanding. However, the next day when I saw him, he seemed to have forgotten my discomfort entirely. We were making out and he suddenly gives me a look of expectation, and requests me to go down on him. I had never felt so uncomfortable and frozen and panicked in my life. No words could form and I was so scared of being judged or making a scene that I kneeled down, he grabbed my hair and pushed my head onto his dick. It lasted about two seconds before I said that I had to go and made a swift exit. He didn’t once ask if I felt comfortable, if I was okay. And I didn’t even break up with him then.. because I thought this that I was the problem.,I could recall countless, literally countless events like this that are just to do with sexual assault experiences from people I knew, not even on the street. But all I’m going to further say is that a year later, I lost my virginity without consent and still have the scars. This was by another school boy. I still thought it was normal and my fault for not screaming and doing more to protect myself. MY FAULT.,Anyway, I now understand that what happened to me and so many other girls for so many years wasn’t okay and I really hope that some change is implemented to educate young boys and help young girls to speak up and feel safe in their own skin.",,
Ass grabbed and sexually harassed outside locker for over a week. Was told that there was nothing that could be done as no cameras were pointed towards my locker.,,
my first sexual experience was extremely unwanted. left me crying and i very audibly said “no get off me”. although this happened 2 years ago it still haunts me.,,
"Me I just left but me and multiple others were sexually harassed multiple times and it was very normalised to the point of teachers not giving it a second thought. The boys are extremely sexist and also seemed to target lgbt students with sexually invasive behaviours and questions. The sex ed was riddled with very troubling religious messages and they would give us the information they are legally required to but always put in something religiously manipulative about women’s reproductive rights and choices, as well as relationships.",,
"I was walking home from [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], the university’s end of year party. It was about 4am and light already. I was alone as my friends stayed out longer than me. A male had been following me on my route home but I assumed he was also just heading back to his halls. As I neared my halls, he ran up behind me and slapped me on the bottom. He then ran away, before stopping and just staring at me.",,
"I was sexually assaulted daily through year 8 and year 9 and year 10. Boys would touch my bum as I walked to class would pinch, slap squeeze, and grab my bum. boys would sit next to me in class and put their arm around me to try and touch my breasts. I tried telling them to stop but it only got worse I tried to ignore it but it the touches became harder or would happen in lessons. I would try and tell teachers but it was never taken seriously. It would escalate in the summer if I wore skirts with boys trying to put their hands up my skirt. Other people accused me of enjoying the attention. Still, over ten years later I walk with my handbag by my bum and I hate anyone being close behind me. The impact this had on my self-image is something I'm still overcoming.",,
"When i was 15 i was physically and emotionally abused. i got pulled out of class crying and taken to the office, where i told them about him trying to force me to give him oral sex and he retaliated by hurting me. he pushed me off him, refused to speak to me, twisted my farm and threw my belongings across the park. they logged it down on the system and said that they’d had complaints about him being violent before. that was it. nothing else was done. he wasn’t removed from my classes or punished in any way. the abuse continued and got worse, and he went on to sexually assault me when i was 17.",,
"I was around 12 years old when some of the boys in class started reaching up my skirt in lessons or form time to see how far they could get without a reaction. Then they started trying to undo girls bras through their shirts whilst sat behind them in lessons. It was a game to them. To this day I’m still not sure if the teachers ever noticed, if they did they never did anything apart from tell the girls to stop making a fuss whilst they were teaching. As far as I’m aware nobody ever reported anything either. I didn’t realise that was wrong until 5 years later after having a conversation with some friends who told me that it’s not normal. But since the age of 12 that behaviour had been so normalised that I didn’t see the wrong in it.",,
i was talking to a boy who i was friends with and he was flirting with me until i found out he had a gf (one of my friends told me) before i found out i had sent him a nude and he had spread it around and showed many of our mutual friends and people i didn't even know. when i confronted him about it he said it wasn't him and put the blame on someone else who i then confronted but it wasn't him. i was called names and it mentally crushed me. many of them still have the picture even when they know it is wrong.,,
"Someone I considered my friend made fake Instagram account to harass me and send me sexual stories she wrote about me on wattpad. She then threatened to rape me, she didn’t even get a detention when the school found out, instead the school told my class that if we told anyone then we’d get an isolation.",,
I knew this boy through my friendship group and we were both at a friends house party but I was really drunk so I barely remember anything but I know we had sex and it probably was consensual but the guy remembers everything as he wasn’t that drunk. It wasn’t rape but I remember near to nothing and feel so horrible about myself since. Was it rape because I was so drunk that I don’t remember it or is it just regret?,,
"I was raped several times from the age 2-12years old by one of my family members. At first I thought it was normal but the more I grew up the more I realised what I was doing was wrong. They had made me watch inappropriate stuff which now made me have an addiction to it not only that but I can’t help but blame myself. I had spoken to the police yet there was no evidence and the case was dismissed. I had to also make another statement for being a witness to someone else being raped that time, not only did that make me anxious but I felt like everyone pushed my experience aside and made it seem like I lied or it wasn’t just as important. After 3years I still can’t get past it and I haven’t gotten the proper help that I need. Whenever I do speak about it to a friend or another family member I feel so much guilt because I had grown up with that person and trusted them the most. I don’t know who I can rely on anymore and I sometimes feel lost.",,
When I was in yr 7 I met this guy in yr 10 and I though it was funny (he was kinda weird but younger me thought it was funny) and I was told by a few teachers to not hang around with him. I thought it was because it was inappropriate to hang out with someone a lot older then me. A year later I was in the music hallway and he was behind me. He pulled me towards him (my back against his chest) and wouldn’t let go I had struggled against his grip but gave up and he pulled me in closed. He had a boner and at the time I didn’t know what that was. A teacher walked by and he let go of me and if it wasn’t for that I wasn’t sure what would’ve happened.,,
"After my maths lesson i went to see my My friend in the corridors because he was pissed off, but when everyone left to go outside and it was just us me and him he pulled me to him and started touching me up. I tried pushing him off me but he was stronger then me,I was shouting really loud but no one came to help me. but as soon as someone walked by he stopped and acted like nothing happened. The worst part was his best friend saw and acting like nothing happened. I am 14 and he is 16",,
"When I was 14 and on the way home from school, a man in his forties came and sat next to me on the bus. I felt instantly on edge because there were plenty of other seats free. He pressed his body against me so I was pretty much pinned against the wall. I could see his erection through his trackies. He then put his hands down his pants and started to masturbate. I felt too embarrassed to ‘make a scene’. I had to climb over the seat in front to get away. There were about ten other people on the bus and no one asked me if I was OK.",,
"We went to pick up my brother from his friends house one day when I was 9 years old and his friend had an older brother who was 13/14 years old. He had always been eager to talk to me every time we went round and always brought up very sexual conversations but I tried to ignore them instead of telling him I was uncomfortable as I had such bad anxiety at the time. He constantly spoke about how mature I looked and was always complimenting me and trying to be my close friend. He told me we could play video games up in his room so I followed him as I genuinely saw him as a friendly guy. When we got to his room, he pulled out his dick and then pushed me on the bed and pulled off my jeans. He fingered me and I told him over and over again that it hurt and I wanted him to stop. He wouldn’t stop and I gave up asking him as he was starting to get angry (he was 6ft2 and I was only roughly 5ft3 and very skinny so I knew I couldn’t fight him off). After that he forced me to touch his dick and he pinned me on his bed and touched my boobs. I sat there silently because I was so terrified of him. I told him to stop atleast 10 times and he was completely aware I was 9 years old. I had to leave his house acting like nothing happened and kept quiet about it every since. Still to this day it haunts me that he goes to school like nothing happened and spoke to some of my friends at my school. I still get flashbacks and what he did to me has literally ruined my life.",,
"When I was 14 years old I was drinking with my friends, on this particular day we had a half day at school because it was ‘speech day’. I wasn’t in uniform but we were drinking on the common near my school. I remember sharing a bottle of vodka with a friend out of our circle, and blacking out. I then remember waking up laying on the floor of the woods with my friend on top of me, him sat on me and his legs around my chest, ejaculating onto my face while I laid there. Once he was finished he completely left me there in the woods half awake and on the floor. A friend of mine found me and carried me out, my top hanging off and cum all over my face. Everyone from my school took photos of me coming out the bushes on their blackberries. I remember my brother being called to pick me up and take me home. The school found out about what happened and made me and the guy involved write a statement. I remember the guy asking me to lie about certain things, I just can’t remember what. I was suspended for drinking, even though they knew what had happened with the boy also. They also made me tell my mum exactly what had happened - which was confusing to me because I didn’t even understand what had happened myself but I remember feeling incredibly embarrassed and shameful. I wasn’t allowed to go to Speech Day at school the next year as a punishment also. I found out later on that the boy had been pretending to swig the vodka when it was his turn, and instead let me drink the whole bottle - which would explain why he was in a position to masturbate onto me and I was passed out. After being suspended and being told to tell my mum, I remember feeling incredibly shameful about what had happened. I was bullied a lot by boys, called names down the hallway, even moving class because of them saying slurs. Lots of things about the sexual activity - but I honestly had no idea that it was assault. I had no support at all regarding what actually happened, I just felt like a slut. I didn’t leave my house that entire summer, and went in on myself, self harming and turning to Tumblr. I just remember not being able to pin point what was wrong. It’s only know I look back I understand what really happened to me.. mainly because it effects me in a lot of sexual situations, it always comes back to me like it was yesterday when I’m in bed with a man. The worst thing was nobody understood that it was assault, and neither did i . I found out recently, (I’m 23 now), that the guy who assaulted me has bipolar disorder and is on Bumble. It scares me knowing that he could do this to someone else and that they could carry the burden and shame that I feel. I wish I could shake it off but it always comes back to me.. maybe if at the time I had support I would’ve reacted better and felt less shameful and wouldn’t feel so scarred",,
"I don’t know if i’m valid for this, but this guy in my school was… horny. he messaged me and kept saying things that made me extremely uncomfortable, like asking me to send nudes and repeatedly talking about his dick. even after multiple times of telling him to leave me alone, he wouldn’t. i hate seeing him everyday in school because i know i’m not the only one he’s done this to. and some girls have experienced worse from him.",,
"When I was at a party aged 15 I was in a bathroom with a guy that I had been seeing. We were both extremely drunk and he convinced me to give him head for the first time, I hadn't really thought about it since, it seemed consensual at the time. I'd had so much to drink that I passed out a few minutes in, I woke up later in the bathroom to find that he had finished himself off all over my clothes. The next day he messaged me laughing about how he had to 'start moving my head for me' when I 'fell asleep'. I had laughed at the time... we stayed together for another year. It's taken me 7 years to decide that I hadn't brought it on myself by 'falling asleep'. Wish I'd had the courage to end it on the spot, but no one ever told me that his behaviour was wrong. Unbelievably messed up.",,
"Even from a young age I’d previously experienced sexual harassment and assault but it only got worse when i was raped a year ago. Although i got support from my friends briefly, it didn’t last and everyone seems to think i’m over it. It was on holiday so i guess people had to believe me but i dread to think if it was someone i’d of known. I don’t think i will truly ever get over it",,
i was sexually assaulted and abused by my girlfriend at the time. i was told it was an overreaction because it was my girlfriend and i should be lucky to have it happen to me,,
i got sexually assulted in a classroom by what was a close friend of mine. i tried to talk to a teacher about it and they told me i was over reacting and not to think about it. he would stop even after i asked him to multiple times. i cried and no one listened. i tried to push him away. and my teachers just didn’t care. they didn’t care what happened to me.,,
my senior year of high school I went to a technical school for cosmetology and we had to ride the bus back and forth from there and our regular high school and the bus driver was awful. For a while I was the only girl on the bus out of 7 of us and I sat in the front and he would always keep looking at me and one time I just plainly asked what and he goes “oh I wasn’t looking at you” LIKE YES YOU WERE SIR. he would always try to talk to me and make these smart remarks to me. Later in the year these 2 other girls started riding the bus also and they noticed the same thing. One day he told me to put my mask (my mask was on just below my nose) and I said “my mask is on” and he said “don’t make me take my belt off” and that’s when I ultimately felt super uncomfortable with him. He even mentioned that one of my friends shirt was “too low” So with all 3 of us feeling uncomfortable we moved to the back with the boys and from then on out he would yell at us for absolutely no reason and find reasons to make us move back to the front. He was so mad that he couldn’t sexualize us anymore because we moved to the back.,,
"i had always had a bit of a thing for my best friend. i ended up plucking up the courage to tell him, but he told me pretty bluntly he didn’t feel the same. however he’d always expressed an interest in having a sexual relationship with me and because i knew no better and thought it would be a way to feel close to him i agreed. most of it was online and always consented to, until we started to “do bits”. he pushed me to do things on a number of occasions i wasn’t comfortable with and when i asked him to stop he tended not to. while all this was going on he had began to emotionally torment me too - he wrote me lists of all the reasons he would never love me and spouted lies about me to the rest of our friends. i still loved him, and still considered him my best friend through all of this so i was terrified to speak up for fear of harming him. eventually a friend persuaded me to and he was immediately kicked out of our friend group - but even that didn’t come without immense pain and hurt. i told my school because i was seeking help and someone to talk to, but the school did essentially nothing, even leaving me to remain sitting next to him in a number of classes until i had to explicitly ask to move.",,
"I was sexually harassed and fetishised by a guy I considered to be my best friend in Year 11. He manipulated me into doing stupid little things yet I was not comfortable with and felt like I couldn’t escape/say no and after finding out he sexually harassed 4 other girls in my year I went to the school seeking comfort, yet all he was given was “a stern talking to” and an hour of isolation which a male teacher let him off. Furthermore, the school even sent an email to my mum saying how I should have been educated on it even though I was the victim? Here I am 2 years later, having breakdowns almost monthly over it whether it’s breaking down over a guy getting close to me or not even being able to feel comfortable with myself and look at my own skin because I feel so disgusted with myself to the point where I completely shut myself down. It’s suspected that I have PTSD from this event and the fact that the school victim-blamed me for something that I couldn’t control was so distressing",,
"I was groomed and hit on by a teacher, at school, from the age of 13. They waited until I turned 16 to pressure me into turning it sexual. They knew exactly what they were doing. I felt too guilty and ashamed to report it, and was convinced that I was to blame. I heard later they repeated it with someone else. I suspect we were not the only ones.",,
Like three different [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys did/ attempted to finger me in my sleep. It was like a thing they did. Everyone was encouraging this one guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] to sleep with me when I was passed out and he was like no she’s too drunk and all the girls were like ‘omg you’re soooo nice you’re like the sweetest guy’,,
A boy groped me everyday in the lunch line in 8th i was too scared to look back so i never got to confront him. I would've said something but i doubt they would've believed me if i didn't have hard evidence. I was so scared.,,
Today (14th of July 2021) a boy was looking up girls skirts a bit of background information is he has adhd and is close to the behaviour management staff there are 26 students in my class and each and everyone of us saw him do it to ourselfs and other students as a class we had to do something we told the teachers who we are ment to trust to protect us what had happened the teachers proceeded to ask for proof of this and called us liars bare in mind he had been harassing others the day before one of the English teachers saw him do one of these acts and we told them that was our proof the English teacher denied this in the face of the behaviour management staff (the people we told) and got me and my friends in a lot of trouble the school are now relying on cctv to see what actually happened bare in mind the cctv cameras aren’t good quality and won’t be able to see where his eyes are looking nor will they see what he was actually doing as the cctv is in the halls (he did it in class) if they think we are lying wich we aren’t the school will suspend us if they notice him doing it he will be suspended they later let him in the classroom with the students he’d just harassed if they find this I will be in deep deep deep deep trouble please don’t tell my school about this x,,
"The first time I was 16 and on holiday with my friends family. We were drinking and walking back to the hotel with my friends and a group of boys we met. I was really drunk and so was he and I consented to kissing. He then wanted to have sex we were on a beach in public I had only had sex 1 other time and we had no protection. Said no multiple times but he just kept trying anyway. Eventually I gave up and let him. I just laid there and waited for it to be over. Afterwards he said are u on the pill. I said “no I tried to tell u that” and he said “oh well if your pregnant u can just get an abortion it’s just a pill. As soon as it was over I cried and my friend said why did u let it happen then and after that I pretended to everyone it was consensual and laughed it off. The second time I was 17 and went to a club underage. After we had been at the club me and my friend went back to a flat for an after party. We knew the boys we were with we went to school with them. I was really drunk I passed out in the room whilst everyone was still drinking. I woke up to him stroking my leg. I passed out again. I woke up on a sofa with him next to me he said come to this room u can sleep there. I faced away from him and tried to sleep, I could feel him touching me I totally froze and pretended to sleep. Eventually he turned me over. I can’t really remember it all to be honest. I remember saying condom and he got one. He told me to take my dress off but I was so drunk and I don’t know scared I couldn’t move and he pulled of my pants and shoved my dress past my bum and then had sex with me whilst I did not move. He did not kiss me prior. Eventually I came to and realised what was happening and shoved him off me and cried in the toilet of some random flat. Luckily I had left school so I never saw him again."" ,""I had a boyfriend of almost two years during 6th form (we have now broken up and I’m at uni now) he was well liked and came across like a nice boy but once we started dating he made my life a living hell and everyone ignored it because he couldn’t possibly be the one in the wrong. He told his friends I was crazy to devalue everything I said against him and he had sex with me on many occasions when I was drunk and I convinced myself it wasn’t rape because he was my ‘boyfriend’. The one time I was sober and said no and told him to stop he continued and when I brought it up to him he used to say ‘stop making it seem like I raped you’, he then spent the next year convincing me it was my fault. I also caught him taking pictures of my naked body without my consent and I have no idea how many he has or how many he’d taken. He turned a large amount of his friends against me so I would feel even more isolated and had to rely on him more. It felt impossible to leave him because I based my value on his opinion of me and put him on this pedestal believing I could change him. It be almost a year since the assault and I have only just come to terms with the reality of what happened and I have repeatedly had nightmares about him raping me. I still don’t like to be touched in certain places because of it and it plagues my mind daily.",,
"I was forced into sending nude pictures of myself to a boy in my year because if not he said he would tell lies about me to all of my friends so that everyone would hate me, so I did it. I wanted to stop but he kept making me, if I told him I was somewhere where I couldn't take any he would tell me to go to the bathroom and do it otherwise he would spread the rumours. He made me facetime with him and show myself to him. He started holding the nudes over my head as well as the rumours as he knew that everyone would make fun of me and call me horrible names and shame me if they found out I'd sent nudes etc. He eventually grabbed me when we were alone in a classroom together and forced me to kiss him while he aggressively shoved his hand down my skirt and tights to touch me. I didn't want him to so I tried to shove him away but he stayed put and then he made me give him oral sex otherwise he would show everyone the nudes I sent him. It's been a while since it happened but I still have to act friendly with him because if we fell out he's threatened that he will tell people what I did to keep him quiet.",,
"He was my best friend - platonic. At [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in GCSE summer, I'd been sixteen for about a month. I was drunk and high and he was entirely sober when we went back to my tent together and after kissing for a while he asked me if I wanted to try something new. I was so nervous, I'd never done anything like this before and before I could really understand what he meant by that in my spaced out drunk and stoned mind he was pulling me down and proceeded to push my head up and down, giving him oral sex. I didn't say no or ask him to stop, but at no point did I ever agree to it or take part in it actively. He used my mouth as if it was a passive object and I just let him. He told all my friends the next day and for the rest of the festival people would constantly make blowjob jokes to me - I could barely remember it actually happening and it being treated so light heartedly made me think that was normal. Only a couple years later now do I see that it was non-consensual and how much it had changed the way I viewed my role in sexual relations - a passive object with no real goal or desire other than to just exist as a hole for the other person. IF YOU ARE STONE COLD SOBER AND SOMEONE ELSE CAN'T EVEN WALK STRAIGHT - THEY CANNOT CONSENT AND YOU CANNOT MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEM.",,
"I was in year 8,when in the girls changing rooms where I went to use the bathroom a guy in the year above me come in with his friends.At that time they didn't know I was in there.They was talking about sex and how me of the boys in the group hadn't lost his virginity yet.He was apparently the only one and was being called gay.That boy told them that he will 'score' soon.The bell for class went so i decided to leave.However coming lut the bathroom,when they saw me one boy said 'nows your chance'. They grabbed me and dragged me into the bathroom.Where they pinned me down and shoved a sock in my mouth and held it there so i couldn't shout for help.Thats when the boy who hadn't lost his virginity proceed to rape me.It felt like forever I was laying there helpless,afraid and embarrassed.Once he finished they got there things and left.I was left on the floor bleeding as hymen had been teared.It still haunts me to this day when I walk past the school.I tried to discreetly tell a teacher without going into detail but she said 'its probably because he likes you."" I was robbed off virginity so a yr 9 boy could prove he wasn't gay.",,
I was going to give my friend a hug goodbye after a night out drinking. Instead he took hold of me and forcefully kissed me when I had obviously shown i was not interested before hand.,,
"When I was in my first year at uni, a boy me and my friends had met in a school near us who sexually assaulted my friend when she was passed out at a party, was in the same bar as me. He grabbed me and pushed my against the wall and started touching me. I had to force him off to get away.",,
About a year ago I told a boy I liked him and he was genuinely really nice about it until one day in lesson he started to put his hand on my thigh. He did this every lesson we sat together and every time he would move his hand further up my leg until he was fully touching my vagina. He would message me trying to manipulate me into sending nudes and when I’d say no he’d try and tell me I want it and that I like it. Some nights I physically couldn’t eat and I even started drinking before school to stop myself getting anxious. One day he had his hand on my vagina and I was frozen I couldn’t do anything. I started to do my work trying to ignore him but he grabbed my wrist and puts my hand on his dick and he had a boner. I tried to get my hand away but he was holding my wrist too tight. I felt so horrible and after lesson I ran to the toilets and cried. When I got home **TW** I got a lighter and consistently burnt my hand to get the feeling away. It felt like the memory was engrained in my palm. Sometimes it still happens and I feel silenced like I can never speak up about it because part of me feels guilty for telling him I like him .,,
"It was my first job in a kitchen at a hotel. I was 18 and on my gap year. All the chefs there would comment on my appearance and not stop staring, the head chef groped me not 2 hours into my first shift. Later on another befriended me and kissed me against my will. One asked me for my number. They were all in their 40s / 50s. When I told the manager - I was fired the following week “for being late” without any warning. HR did nothing about it.",,
"i was really really drunk and a boy, who was barely drunk, was flirting with me. he led me into the woods with him and started getting with me. he started to slide his hands in my pants and i was too drunk to know what was going on although i felt really uncomfortable. i kept telling him that i was on my period and to stop yet he tried to finger me and then he was physically cockblocked by my tampon. we then stopped and left the woods but ik that he wouldn’t have stopped if he wasn’t physically blocked which is the worst thing. the fact that he was basically sober whilst i was drunk and took advantage of me was so horrible and i just felt so objectified and peer pressured by horny boys.",,
"I once had a one night stand with someone when I was 19. A few months later I bumped into him doing his security job at Nottingham Train Station. He asked me if I wanted to go to his car for a kiss & cuddle. He just left his job, we went to his car & suddenly he switched the engine on & drove me away. I was very frightened not knowing where I was going, worrying I was going to miss my train home, worrying he might kill me. We had sex at his house. I remember Holby City was on & I remember thinking to just do what he wants to keep myself safe & get back to the train station ASAP. Thankfully he took me back in time & I was safe but I cried all the way home.",,
"I was in primary school in year 2 and he was in year 3. We shared the same playground so became friends for about a week and I remember playing hide and seek etc every lunch break. One day he said I should hide and if he found me there would be a consequence. Long story short, he found me and told me the consequence was he wanted to see my underwear. Obviously I said no but he kept asking and trying to lift up my skirt. He got his best mate to pin my arms back but I just kicked him when he tried again. Then he got his other best mate who was a bit of a tom-boy who I thought might of helped me, but did what the boy said and held my legs down. This was all done in the open in a corner of the playground. I kept struggling but I think he got flashes of my pants and he tried to lift up my skirt. Eventually my friend saw and told a teacher and they came to tell him he could play with me anymore. I didn’t really know right or wrong back then but there wasn’t any consequence for him and I didn’t tell anyone. He now goes to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity].",,
"I was waiting in line for the teacher to say that I could go a grab some food when 3 boys came up behind me and were giggling they make me feel uncomfortable and then one of them slapped my arse.The teacher did nothing and the boys who were 2 yrs bellow me carried on giggling, I was 16 at the time. And I felt like I had been violated, the worst part is I even knew one of them.",,
"I was at my friends party and was kinda drunk and this guy who I had been kind of speaking to kept on pulling me away and about 3/4 times we went away and we’re just kissing but I kept on saying I wanted to go back to the party and be with my friends but whenever we went back he would keep coming and pulling me away and I was getting increasingly drunk until eventually he kept on asking so we slept together, I thought this was normal at the time but now I hate thinking about it and have realised I was 100% was not in a position to be able to consent - it’s left me feeling guilty and ashamed when for guys it can be just another number and score.",,
"I was 15 and It was my first time meeting the guy I really liked and had been getting on super well with.He went to boarding school so we had just been getting to know eachother through Snapchat and he had been a little forward,asking for my nudes saying I wasn’t putting out but I thought oh well he’s just horny it’s fine he doesn’t mean that.But when we met,we were drinking and he had been so sweet nd kind.I was drunk and he wasn’t at all.He had me sat on his lap nd groped my boobs and bum through my top nd jeans,even trying to get me to take down my jeans.I got straight off him,knowing I didn’t like it even when I was drunk nd he pulled me straight back,not letting me go saying I should just let him.I told him the next day what he did to me nd how upset I was nd he just said well I didn’t grope you or touch you wrong u let me do whatever u didn’t say no or even show you didn’t want it even when I had moved off of him.To this day,he still hasn’t learnt what he did was wrong and still relentlessly asks for sexual pictures of mine.",,
when i was one the train this random man sat next to me and he started touching my thigh when i tried to move he blocked the way and i didn’t want to make a scene. when i told a boy that this happened to me he said “you shld have just moved”,,
he coerced me to have sex with him and gaslighted me throughout our whole relationship. i still have flashbacks to when he did that to me and i didnt realise what he had done until months after we broke up and i realised that wasnt normal. he gets too move on happily whereas i have to deal and work through all this trauma.,,
Touched inappropriately and threatened countless times for all 4 years of highschool,,
I was walking WITH MY FRIENDS one day down the street from my skl and a random dude who I don’t know never met him don’t know his name (had to be abt 3 years older than me at least) walked up behind me and slapped ms ass then grabbed my tit. I ran off before he could do anything else but then my male friend ran afte me and told me that I was asking for it wearing those clothes IT WAS MY SKL UNIFORM. This is the worst along many catcalls verbal harassment being followed and more,,
"When I was aged 11-13, there was a culture in my school where it was considered ok for the boys in your class to, as a group, grab you and forcibly open your bra. In an island community everyone knew each other and were either friends or relations. Everyone always seemed to treat this as a joke, so in order to not stand out, did the same. I hated it, but felt there was nothing I could do.",,
"I must have been 8 or 9, in year 4, and I was the “quiet girl”. I was sitting in class next to one of the confident sporty boys that everyone wanted to be friends with. All the teachers loved him, he was cheeky but never got in too much trouble. I can’t remember how it happened but he put his hand in his pants and then put the same hand under my skirt and touched me. He then told me that we’d had sex. At break time he went around telling all the boys that we’d had sex. I didn’t know as much about sex and I was terrified. For the next week he continued to tease me about it, humping my bag in the playground and all I could do was laugh because everyone else was laughing. I never told anyone about him touching me but I told my mum about him humping my bag and she said it was just because he liked me and didn’t know how to express it. 6 years later it still haunts me and I find it so hard to have physical contact with even platonic friend and am dealing with anxiety, depression and dissociative disorders partly due to his ignorance and actions.",,
"I have just finished my first year at uni. Like any uni student I went out and had too much to drink. There was a guy that had been trying on and off with me all night. We were all drinking in the flat and at this point my memory is very faint. Keeping in mind he was stone cold sober. He proceeded to take me to my room and did things to me and made me do things to him. I’m still not sure what this actually means or is, if I have a right to feel taken advantage of. I feel like I don’t have a leg to stand on with anything. In the morning I said I didn’t really remember anything, he said oh well and left.",,
"Once a man sat next me me on the bus, and when I tried to get off when it was my stop he wouldn’t get up allowing me to leave. After asking several times he continued to refuse meaning I had to squeeze through the gap between him and the seat in front. As I did so he grabbed my waist and reached under my skirt.",,

"When I was in 6th form I went to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] spoons after a school play with some friends. My parents were angry I hadn’t come straight home and we had an argument over the phone. I then got quite drunk with my friends and as we left the pub I got separated from them apart from one boy. I told him I’d had an argument with my parents and didn’t want to go home. He said I could stay in his spare room as he lived close by. When we got home he took me into his bedroom and started kissing me, which I was fine with, although I knew he was my friends ex and I probably shouldn’t have done it. He was on top of me in his bed when he started strangling me without asking. it got so hard that my vision started tunnelling and I was worried he wouldn’t stop so I pushed him off. I rolled over and pretend to go to sleep because I was worried he would try something again. When I told some people at school they seemed more annoyed with the fact that he’d been my friends ex. Non-lethal strangulation is now illegal and I wish I’d made a complaint at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when it happened even if it meant people saying horrible this about me.",,
my whole year was sitting in the hall and the teachers made all the girls stand up and they looked at everyone’s skirts and told most people to make them longer. it felt so demeaning having to do that in front of all the boys and we all felt so hyper-sexualised having grown adult teachers walking up and down looking at the length of our skirts,,
"A teacher that is supposed to be there for people, compared my sexuality to someone that uses people. I've had multiple experiences with homophobic people and teachers dont do anything. There was a pride flag in the window and one of the students said to take the sh*t down. Also I've been told being gay is wrong and is a choice. A boy in my class kept saying f@ggot and he was sat in the front of the classroom and then when the boy at the back was talking, the teacher was like I can hear ur conversations from the back so that just shows the teacher did hear the kid being homophobic but didnt do anything about it. In pa, the teacher asked the class what they would do if their friend was gay and all the boys said they would drop them. They dont take homophobia seriously and it doesnt make me or my other friends feel safe. I cant even hold my gfs hand in school anymore without the fear of people hating on us"",And similar things have happened so many more times, but I didn't know it was sexual harassment until I joined social media, I finally understood my rights. And I will never stay quiet again.",,
I’m in the library as I’m writing this and this boy who is known to be a perv keeps staring at me and taking photos. Things have to change I feel so uncomfortable and all I’m trying to do is write an essay. I don’t know what to do,,
"Reflecting on my years at the school from a male perspective, I find that the most rampant, blatant and damaging element of [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] rape culture is and has (in my time) always been the social/psychological aspect amongst boys and girls alike. Having good friends from both groups I got a wider view, and the culture was pushed by both, but my most disgusting experiences were always private/“locker room” discussions with boys. Everyone knew the rankings of the opposite sex, everyone knew what base everyone had been to (and consequently how cool/popular you were), everyone knew who had been with who and what they’d done. Whenever anything happened the gossip was rabid, sex drove the entire social scene, it pervaded all [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] life. This aggressively perpetuated the more serious elements of rape culture:,- Sex made you popular, irrespective of age or intention,- Boys who made (consistently inappropriate) sex jokes were funny,- Girls had to dress a certain way or be ignored as people,- The social order was regularly and openly debated (based essentially exclusively on physical appearance and sexual behaviour),- Boys had little empathy for, or even just understanding of, girls’ feelings,- If a boy made a joke that was too far it was laughed off and swept under the rug (it was always the boys, let’s be real),- Predatory/“rapey” behaviour was joked about,- Everyone knew who the creepy teachers were, but didn’t want to say anything until they eventually “disappeared”,- Nicknames rooted in slut-shaming and rape culture became common usage,- Anyone with an awkward sexual experience would have it tied to their name permanently,The list could go on forever and what I’ve written so far is frankly tame, but I don’t want to detract from my key takeaway: change has to be in the openness of discussion and the rigour of sexual education. SexEd (like most pastoral education at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]) was a joke, as was the culture around sex (the change must be led from a student-level as much as a school one, stop making fun of SexEd). People learnt primarily through their mistakes and frequently through poor advice passed down the years. Some behaviours people genuinely thought were ok at the time, and I know for a fact that those same people are looking back in disgust right now. Thankfully I did see a change for the better at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] as time went on, particularly with reference to consent, but really the symptoms were addressed as opposed to their cause. People are afraid to speak, to risk relentless humiliation or social exclusion for one wrong step. That includes girls who have been abused but not wanted to say anything, boys who didn’t know what they were doing but went along with what their mates did, the reverse and everything in between. Far too often the expectation was that if you had a bad experience, you put on a brave face and move on - hopefully people would forget about it soon enough. This is real and I hope these testimonies have made that clear. Talk with your peers, respectfully criticise each other, take your concerns to the school’s Head’s, lead the change from both sides.,""my stories seem trivial compared to some others, but I think these micro aggressions also massively contribute to rape culture. The boys would rate all the girls legs when we were in our p.e kit or they would save bikini pictures for ‘wank banks’. They constantly obsess over girls bodies in the most disgusting and intrusive way. The amount of comments they all make but just call them ‘jokes’ which for some reason means that they shouldn’t be held accountable for saying something completely inappropriate.",,
I was an art student and i had specifically based my art round the female body - I had talked to my teacher -who is male- about the people who I had art connections who express their bodies in a positive light- the next day I get called into student support and the teacher had accused me of being a prostitute just because of the way I dressed in fishnets and a dress with wild make up - I was told that I had an Ann summers vibe for wearing fishnets,,
I was only 12 and it was In a field the school had known. He had bruised my whole body and told me to kill myself he got one day of isolation and it was never spoke about again.,,
I was at this dude’s house and he invited me into his room. I didn’t think anything of it because we had known each other since we were kids. I was 13he was 17. He randomly asked me to sit on his lap. I laughed and said no. He got more serious and asked again. I said no but he kept on asking until I said ok. His hands were on the inner part of my thighs and I could feel him getting hard. He kept on pushing himself against me and I was really uncomfortable but didn’t know what to do.,,
"for the majority of year 9 i was sat next to this him and his friend for multiple classes. comments would be made about my thighs and ass to my face and I would just laugh long with it because I didn't know what to do, because its just harmless banter right? at the beginning anyway, I came to think of this boy as my friend because I'm not gonna lie, i like the attention when it was just occasional comments cos they made me feel validated. but then it got weird he would start actually touching my things and my hips and he grabbed my ass when i was leaving class once. his friend would 'try' to join in because that was what conversation was about between us- he only touched my thighs nothing further. his friend was obviously uncomfortable doing it to me, so i don't get why he let this boy do it to me. its funny looking back cos only now do i realise i should have said something, but it was so long ago, what are they going to do? for anyone reading this, speak up because that's the only way to prevent it happening and to help raise awareness.",,
There was one boy who would always talk to me in drama in year9. the teacher would often leave the lesson and he would always put his arm around me and try to look down my shirt. on a trip we were watching a play and he sat next to me and slid his hand up my leg and tried to touch me as it was dark even though i kept trying move my leg away he wouldn’t stop. in year 11 when we did drama again i went to the toilet and before i went into the class he stopped me and took me to the side of the corridor and pinned me against the wall and told me to stop being so frigid and just let him have me and tried to grope me and kiss me,,
"When I was 9 yo a family friend began touching me sexually, the incidents began with pinning me up and kissing me which I made clear I was uncomfortable with. Over the next year and a halo fit progressed into them squeezing my breasts and fingering me. They became increasingly violent and manipulative and they physically attacked people who tried to get them off me. The bit a friend of mine who tried to get her off me and rugby tackled anyone who would try speak to me about the situation. Many people reported this to school including myself who reported the incidents around 17 times. The incidents began in primary school y5 and ended the last day of primary. The person was from a troubled background and had a lot of issues at home that being a family friend, my parents were aware of. The parent of the person was manipulative of my mum and scared her out of defending me. The members of staff had been told by the person’s parents I was bullying them, this is absolutely untrue and the only time I was ever unpleasant towards them was when i was trying to get them to stop. Towards the last 3 weeks is when the fingering started, it was in my final year and I had been given the power of head of council, the member of staff I told about the fingering did not believe me despite 4 others coming forward to say they had seen it. During my conversation with the member of staff I was accused of being horrible to them and I was told if I spoke about the situation further my position as head of council would be removed. This made my mum furious and her and my best freinds mum who worked in school apealed for a councillor, we got this and spoke to her but ‘there wasn’t much she could do we only had 3 weeks of school left’ she really didn’t do much at all but she did have it passed on to my high school that is be moving to in 9 weeks time that me and her should be separated . It calmed down for 3 weeks until the ‘y6 leavers’ at this event she chased me into a toilet and began attempting to take my jumpsuit off. Luckily for me a parent heard me scream and came to stop her, the parent then went up to her mum and told her what had happened and she replied with ‘oh well as long as she’s having fun’. The innocent was over 4 years ago and I still get panic attacks over the issue now, I moved away from her high school in y8 and am now getting counciling over the incident in my new highschool. I’m in a new position as head girl at this school and panic attacks often come up when my position is potentially getting questioned, I truly believe this spawned from the threats from my primary school teacher and I know they failed to protect me.",,
"When I was a student at the school, everyone knew of one teacher who was frequently inappropriate- from leaning over too close and touching our thighs etc, to commenting on the size of our breasts, he delighted in humiliating us. Me and others. He was disgusting. If anyone complained then he behaved professionally when someone came to observe him in class as though that meant it was all fine and us students were making it up. He was always known as the perve.,Same school it was fairly common knowledge that one of the science teachers had had relationship with an underage pupil, apparently had a suspension and then eventually left. Another newer science teacher we knew was in a relationship with a 6th form student and another teacher in the school tried to groom a younger student.,A male English teacher was creepy as hell, staring inappropriately during class, leering and making inappropriate comments.,The Head at the time made it a toxic culture so if you fell on her bad side you were screwed so these male teachers at an all girls school were just allowed to do what they want.,I don't know if the teachers went after the girls or enjoyed the attention of the girls going after them, but certainly there was a culture that male teachers could get away with anything.",,
"I am in my early '70's but when I was 17 and a virgin, I was given a lift home by an old friend from my school years. He raped me in his car despite the fact I said no and tried to get him off me. I was a strong person but he was in the army and very fit. My family never knew and only a handful of people do to this day. It was impossible, as it is today, to secure a successful prosecution, so I just told 1 person my best friend. The next time I told anyone was in my late 30's. I cringe every time I hear of or see rape portrayed on TV. It never goes away.",,
"This guy went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but he joined [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in sixth form. He had a drop box of nudes and he had different albums for what ever he “felt like wanking too” titled things like “ass pics” or “tit pics”. He showed me them on the coach on the way to games (it was rock climbing). He also made up a rumer he fingered me on the coach, it wasn’t true - I’d never even kissed him, but I had his friends in the year above ask me if he had or worse they would tell me they knew he had.",,
"I fall asleep in an upstairs bedroom after a party at my friends house, and woke up to this guy in my year trying to finger me while I was sleeping. I told him to leave me alone but he wouldn’t listen. I finally managed to get rid of him but felt so violated after. What made it worse it that later I’d find out he had done the same to my friends too. We were 15. The worst part is we felt so ashamed that none of us said anything till much later, and only to each other. He’s still in our friendship group...",,
"the boys would use me, not anyone else.",,
"in second grade a kid put their hands in my pants when we were in a small class of seven people, i ended up speaking up and all i got from the teacher who ran the class was how i should have said something sooner and blamed me for this mess as she was now being investigated for not having noticed. The kid didn’t get kicked out, he stayed in the group, as well as stayed at the school with no consequence.",,
it was a friday night and i went round to the boys house that i had been speaking too for a week or two and we sat in his living room for a few hours and got comfortable around each others company. he asked if i wanted to go to his room with him as we could play cod or something and i agreed but he ended up forcing himself on me to kiss me and when we stopped i went on my phone he then took it into his own hands to take my phone and force himself on to me again and then went down to unbutton my jeans. i shouted no and for him to stop and he did thankfully but i then started to have a panic attack as of my past and he just sat there and watched didn’t help me and then he walked me home and tried to kiss me again but i had walked off before he could because i was on the verge of tears. and the worst part is i still want to be with him.,,
"There was a network of girls’ nudes that were passed around and traded throughout the school and guys would show everyone their collections and albums. I was in year 8 when fellow year 8 boys showed me, thinking I’d be impressed or find it funny. When the school found out about the pictures/videos, they expelled or suspended the girls whose nudes got leaked but nothing was done about the dozens of boys who sent them around. The boys found it really funny when they told me this.",,
I was sexually assaulted at my school for three months. The school did nothing except suspend me and send me to a disciplinary school. He was expelled but why was I punished for him. The cops did nothing as well. There is so much more to this story and many other girls if you are in so sorry and I wish you all the strength.,,
"Our school headmaster is a nonce and no one cares and tells us to stop being dramatic. If we have our skirts on they have it down to our knees and if we roll them up we’ll get told to roll them back down because it’s distracting and not smart. If we don’t want to wear a skirt we can wear trousers but girls especially have to wear baggy ones , i was called over by the headmaster and told i have a really nice body shape (figure) and that i look really cute but it’s too distracting . On non-uniform day girls get called over for having their bellybuttons showing our nipples or too tight trousers, there is one specific female teacher in our school who calls girls disgusting and distracting, and uses her husband as a reason for men/boys to be distracted if we wear something “inappropriate” her husband is lovely tho and wouldn’t do such a thing . Every girl at this school is experiencing pedophilia and harassment by the boys who touch us without consent, and being brought down by teachers who tell us to stop being dramatic, and just stay away from the person who harass us.",,
"When I was 16 I went to a bar with two of my girl friends and some guys that they brought along. We all got on and started drinking. When me and a girl went to the bathroom she told me that the guys had made a bet amongst each other about who could get with me tonight first. She explained that that was why they were buying us so many drinks. I wasn’t sure what to make of it, I thought it was weird but maybe I should be flattered? (In hindsight absolutely not) I didn’t think it was so serious and felt safe due to the fact that the guys weren’t strangers or randos. At the end of the night my friend is helping me walk and puts me to bed in her bed and sleeps on the sofa in the same room. Idk how long after I wake up, one of my friends‘ guy friends is on top of me kissing me and touching me everywhere. I guess he won the bet. I remember having no idea what was going on or how this happened. I felt immediately embarrassed. I had never kissed anyone before and wasn’t ready to. Before I went unconscious again I remember just feeling frozen and repulsed. My next memory is waking up disoriented the next morning with the guy gone. I felt guilty and angry with myself because I thought it was my fault for putting myself in this situation. That’s why I never felt I could tell anyone about it. 6 years later, thanks to the bravery of others sharing their testimonies here, I finally confronted myself about it properly and only now realise that it wasn‘t my fault. I now realise, that this experience alongside countless other uncomfortable moments has affected the way I viewed myself, and my body. However, I’m not sure what to do about this and I live in fear of something similar or worse happening again.",,
"This is very hard to write out in full. When I was 16 I met this guy who was initially very friendly and warm to me. It only took 2 weeks for him to assault me the first time. I was having a nap at my friends house and he climbed in to bed with me and started touching my hips and waist, trying to pull off my trousers, and groping me in general. I was awake for it but I was frozen and never said no, I just silently begged for him to not go any further. Eventually he pulled away and I ""woke up"". This wasn't the only time he was overtly sexual with me. Due to me not having much experience with friendship he had convinced me that sexual touching is just how he shows platonic affection, and that it was normal. He'd grope me in public frequently in front of friends, make jokes about my assault, implied he had masturbated over me, and when we were alone he'd often pin me down so I couldn't move, one time holding a knife to my neck. I'd always laugh it off and dismiss it because he'd totally convinced me it was normal, but I was always deeply uncomfortable & tense whenever we were in contact. It took me 2 years to admit to myself it was assault and possibly grooming. The aftermath has been devastating for me and began a harmful pattern of letting people coerce me into sex I didn't want. He is a very charming character so I doubt many people would believe me over him if I told everybody. I'm now left trying to repair my trust and mental health while he only lost a few friends over this.",,
"when i was 14 i stayed over at a friend's house after a party. it was the first time I'd been properly drunk and at the party I'd kissed most of my friends indiscriminate of gender. so i had kissed this friend at the party. at the friends house we went upstairs to watch some tv. i was still drunk, we were leaning on each other and we got with. for a while. i fell asleep while we were doing it, i dont remember all of it. but i remember the next morning and she acted like nothing happened. that's what fucked me up a bit. when she realised i remembered she didnt talk to me for a few months. i probably wouldntve cared too much otherwise. but she did that thinking i wouldnt remember, that she could do that without my consent and i would never know. it was a few years ago but that instance stuck with me, because it was someone i trusted, not a stranger i barely knew or someone i ever got bad touch vibes from.",,
"I was on a packed tube and felt what I thought was an umbrella behind me digging into my backside. After a few minutes of this getting worse, I looked round and it was a man right up against me with his erect penis out and deliberately rubbing it on me. I was so shocked I didn't know what to say and simply got off the tube at the next stop. He stayed on.""",,
"I dated this guy and it ended quite messily. Little did I know he was talking about my body to the majority of mine/his friends and still to this day I get messages talking about my chest size etc. I’ve blocked him but he constantly tries to call me. If I join the call (which I did previously) he makes fun of my image but makes sure I know this doesn’t include my chest . I thought he was a good guy, but he had been sharing details about my body to his friends even before I was with him. It’s so crazy how people try and decide your worth by how you look . Things you can’t control.",,
"i was harrassed for nude photos, and once i was forced to give in, i was told they would be sent to other people.",,
We were on a school trip in the holidays and we were all sharing a room. I had over heard the boys when I was just in the room next to them bet how much money they would put on me to slap my ass. They said 50p.. I felt totally embarrassed and alone. I was only 15 at the time and insecure about my body and it has always played a huge part on how I look at myself and my appearance.,,
Younger students upskirt the sixth formers and cause trouble and start looking at them inappropriately,,
I meant someone in sixth grade who I sone became friends with and last year in seventh grade he sexually assaulted me and when I told someone I got in trouble and I just don’t know what to do anymore,,
"I was out with friends in local bar, as we walked out the bar to go somewhere else a man in his 30s grabbed me and tried to put his hands up my skirt passed my knickers. When I turned round and said what do you think you're doing? He said what's your problem? You're wearing a dress what did you expect. I was 18.",,
"A boy (a friend) repeatedly touched me inappropriately and made me uncomfortable on multiple accounts after telling him to stop. He repeatedly harassed me for indecent images, claiming that it was okay because 'friends show each other their nudes' and made inappropriate comments such as 'your bum is a really nice shape'. After many many occasions that caused my own personal discomfort, this resulted in an event involving severe sexual coercion whilst I was intoxicated and further sexual assault, after saying no and pushing the boy off multiple times. The school have not approached me, or directly addressed my allegations or complains concerning this boy. Rather their attitude is to tell everyone to not disassociate with the perpetrators due to their mental health (ignorant of the victims' mental health), and to rather draw a line under the issue . This is not the only example of an event such as this one at this particular school.",,
Our school makes us do cross country with the boys in our year and a massive group of them make comments on the girls boobs and their butts and stare at us while we run and the teachers do nothing about it so we need to pretend it’s ok while everyone is clearly uncomfortable,,
"I met a guy through Tinder and we both wanted to meet up. I invited him over to my house and my roommates were home. I stressed that nothing would happen and to keep it PG. He said he understood. When he arrived we played some video games and then he pushed me down on the bed. I told him no and to keep it PG. Every time I said PG he told me it was PG if the cameras turned away. I kept trying to push him off me, I wasn’t anywhere near my phone. I kept trying to tell him to continue playing the video game. I said no over and over. He slid his hand down my pants and I kept trying to pull them out. Only one thing got him to stop, I told him one of my male friends was waiting for me and told him he had to leave. I still think I would have been raped that day if I didn’t use that excuse. I feel so weak, I couldn’t do anything to get him off. It took me a couple weeks to realize that I had been sexually assaulted",,
"When i was 14 i started getting more of the attraction from the boys because of how i looked in tighter clothing, however they always say i am flat and try to threaten me to send them nude pictures of my top half or my full body. This has been going on now for quite a long time and i don't know how to stop it as it feels like something regular.The school doesn't show any sign of protection or security , they don't even bother to educate everyone on such a empowered subject. The only thing in the school about this are posters that the students have put up.",,
i was sexually assaulted,,
I was three years old. That was all. And I thought the world of my step brother not to mention we did have a 14 year age gap. I loved him so much and then the night happened we where sharing a bed just while he was staying for the night and he raped me. I have no clear memories other than watching a film while it happened and running to the bathroom and crying after,,
"I never really spoke about this, I didn’t realise I was actually sexual assaulted until I understood the concept of what it is and what it involves (let’s be honest schools never taught this stuff ) I was the girl in school that was always bullied, all the boys used to pick on me no matter what, I was standing waiting to go into class when a bunch of boys who bullied me were standing near in a group, one decided to come up behind me And pinch my arse. I jumped in shocked and yelled, I knew it was them as they start laughing among themselves, I then moved further away from and continue to wait for class. I was only 14. It wasn’t until a few years later I realise what had happened and I was disgusted and felt sick of the idea that they thought it was completely okay to come and touch me when I never gave consent. To them it was a joke to pinch my arse to get a reaction, but to me it was a complete violation of my own body that I never gave them consent to touch me. Let’s be honest if I told teachers this, nothing would’ve been done. They probably would’ve got a slap on the wrist and that’s it",,
"I was sexually assaulted by a class member, a friend, my boyfriend. He thought it would be okay since we were dating and it wouldn’t be assault if i didn’t want to.",,
"A guy i dated when i was in year 9 (i though he was a year older than me i now know he was 3 years older than me) tried to pressure me into sexual stuff. After breaking up with him i never heard from him for 3 years. When i finally went to college in my first year i realised he went there to i thought nothing of it and tried to avoid him until he started trying to be near me a lot, about 6-7 months into being in college he approched me in the common area whilst i was talking to people and hugged me out of no where and he grabbed my boobs and groped me and refused to leave me alone after i asked him to even sent me threatning messages after I tried to report him... what then happened was the college sided with him letting him stay in college and in a mentoring role... i stopped going to places i loved because he was there",,
"i was 14 and on the bus on the way home after spending the night at a friends house. i stood next to the doors so it would be easier to get off when i reached my stop, so obviously i’d need to move to let people past me who got off earlier than i did. i had moved to the side to let a grown man off the bus, but as he left he took his hand and dragged it palm down from my hip across my stomach and left without even looking at me. i was confused and scared and wondering how nobody had noticed. i still stand near the doors when on buses, but to this day i always make sure to move back instead of to the side if anyone ever needs to get off",,
"I was sexually abused by my boyfriend when I was 14, 15 and 16 years old. He would force me to have sex with him when I said no, manipulating me or forcing me physically. He had sex with me when I was sleeping. He also forced me to give him oral sex as I was crying. Throughout these instances I said no or was clearly distressed, crying or having an anxiety attack. He didn’t care. I never understand that this was rape until a year after I broke up with him. I am 19 years old now and I still have servers anxiety and trauma from this. I was never taught in sexual education what consent was and how your boyfriend can rape you. I don’t think he understood either.",,
"During [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I went to a small house party with my close home friends. There was one boy there that was a plus 1 and nobody knew him, so I made the effort to chat with him so he wasn't alone. I was sitting next to him in the hot tub when he forced his fingers inside of me, with 8 other people in the hot tub. I told him to stop and that I had a boyfriend but he continued. When I tried to leave the hot tub he grabbed my leg and pulled me back in. I managed to leave the hot tub and locked myself in a bathroom. He knocked and knocked and knocked at the door until I opened it. He then blocked my exit, locked the door and proceeded to have sex with me in the bathroom, having asked my ex boyfriend from years previously who was also at the party for permission, but not asking me. I was distraught, and cried for most of the evening. My mental health deteriorated badly afterwards and I felt like I couldn't tell anyone because he was a medical student and it would ruin his career, and because I didn't want my boyfriend to leave me.",,
"I was friends with this one dude when I started [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in 7th grade. He was a cool dude. One day we decided to skip elp and walk around the school. Later into our walk he confessed his feelings towards me. I had a girlfriend at the time and I'm a lesbian. So I rejected him. He said that was fine, but later after that we were walking past some stairs and all of a sudden he pushes me against the wall and starts trying to make out with me I keep trying to push him off and nothing was working until he tried to put his hands down my pants is when I started hitting him. I got him off before he could do anything else. I told the school about it the next day but they didn't do shit about it. So [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] if you see this, I will never forget what almost happened.",,
"Hey guys! A few mounths ago i use to date some sweet guy,I mean he was all nice and all at the start but after the half year we went through together he changed,I mean he changed got into a fight with my best friend and when in came up to ex after all he started forcing me not to use condom which afc i wount agree with it was his first time with me so he didn’t know what he was doing anyways.I was all games and all for him he kept going even though i was pushing him and telling him to stop also i had to take the morning after pill when it happened the first time then it happened again i cried cuz there was not any other way of me getting him off of me then he blamed me for the way i made him feel but girls please if u see something is up try to talk to the person and dont fall for the sweet word they are using get to know them well and avoid in any way u can situations of rape and any type of non conceptual activityes.",,
"i came to a new school in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. i met this girl who was extremely nice to me, and in the first two weeks of going there, i went to her house. when i went to her house, she would touch me inappropriately. she would touch me inappropriately in school to. i never thought anything about it until she told a story about her ex touching her and i told her that she does the same thing to me. she told me what she does to me is different because her love language is touch, but i’m asexual so it makes me very uncomfortable. since then i have blocked her on everything but i still dread seeing her next year in school.",,
I always thought these events were never serious when I was younger. Now I’m older I realise they were not acceptable. In year 9 I was in the school playground when a boy (from a younger year) came behind me and grabbed both my breasts and ran off laughing. I brushed it off at the time as no one had ever told me that this was wrong. I also had shared experiences with other girls in my year when boys would lift up skirts in the lunch queue and try and grab our bums. This became so normalised within our year that it became a joke. No one ever did anything,,
"Some boys at my school thought it would be funny to create a “point system”. Yep, it’s exactly what you think. 1 point if they kissed a girl, 2 points for second base, 3 points for third base and the list goes on. They actually thought this was funny.",,
"I was 24. I had been to self-defence classes, carried a whistle and always took the safest route because 'I don't want to get raped'. Little did I know it was going to be someone I trusted. We had dated for a few months the year before but it didn't work out. We were out drinking with a group of friends. We ended up walking next to each other at the back of the group in between bars. We got to a car park and stopped - in all honesty we were having a fucking lovely chat. We kissed, it was nice. I was aware we'd had sex before, so I literally said to him 'kissing is fine but I don't want to have sex'. He agreed. I was cold and wanted to go home. We agreed to share a taxi, to go to mine then to his. I noticed it pass my house. ""I thought we could continue our conversation over a cup of tea then you could head home"" he said. I said that was fine but I didn't want to have sex. We had a cup of tea in his lounge and he asked if I wanted to stay over as there was a mattress on the floor. He would sleep upstairs after a quick cuddle. He kissed me, a good night kiss I assumed so I let him but then he didn't stop. He raped me. I pleaded with him to at least use a condom as I wasn't on birth control but he ignored it. I cried. I felt so defeated. I woke up at 7am, ran home and had a long, long shower. 18 months later and I'm up at 3am unable to sleep because every time I close my eyes I feel like he will attack me.",,
"Random guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] would drink and call my phone 55 times, he would get drunk and become sexually aggressive. Then he told friends we hooked up & tried to ruin my reputation when I never told anyone how he would get drunk and ask to finger his butt hole.",,
"I got raped at a house party at 16, begged him not to, crying, 100+ people were there, that wasn’t enough to stop it. Almost every time I leave the house, I get catcalled, summer or winter, no matter what I’m wearing, even in my school uniform. I have been catcalled wearing a puffer coat and baggy jeans, in broad daylight, since I never go out past sunset out of fear for my own safety. Old men, twice or even triple my age make comments about my appearance and body even on the busiest streets, in front of others. Nowhere feels safe to me as a young woman. This has all been happening since I was 15. I could go on but I’d rather not.",,
I got raped by my girlfriend. I was 12 going 13 she was 15 going 16,,
"I was 16 and at party of a mates sibling. I was kissing this boy (who was 19) towards the end of the night and he came with me to sleep in a spare bed. He got on top of me and i said i didn’t want to have sex he then got his penis out and tried to put it inside i pushed him off. He then grabbed my hand and pushed it onto his penis and i kept saying i’m going to call the police. Every 3 mins he would get on top of me again and try to finger me and put himself inside of me. At about 7am he had to leave and he tried again - i said no, he threw a glass of water at me and slapped me laughed and left. I told my friends and they said ‘What did you expect you were kissing him and took him to bed’ i thought it was completely normal thing to have happened. I was made to feel like i was in the wrong by my own female friends.",,
I was at a party and I had gotten quite drunk that I had vomited in the bathroom. After I left the bathroom a boy started handing me shots of vodka and telling me to drink them. I was still very drunk so I did as he said and after about 3 shots he stopped and smelt my breath. The party went on as normal but then about 10 minutes later he started kissing me and he tried to finger me.,,
A boy who I barely knew took advantage of a situation where I was basically passed out drunk to grope me under my underwear and puts his hands down my pants. When I tried to refuse or move away he just laughed in the way you laugh at someone who’s so drunk they are talking gibberish.,,
"he was my boyfriend, it was christmas day. i’d seen on his phone that he’d been texting other girls during the day so i got upset and i laid in bed and cried. he decided to masturbate on me whilst i was crying. i felt numb and sick. i was lying there literally dead whilst he came on me. i still think about it multiple times a day and it has deeply affected me",,
This happened in year 8 last There is a student who goes around fingering other Male students as a joke. This has terrified me as nobody as stood up to me and nobody stopped him.,,
"I sat in a classroom, one of two girls trying to do work, there were a number of boys messing about at the back. One of them exposed himself to us, encouraged by his friends. To embarrass us. To make us feel powerless. They all laughed. I experienced this three other times within six months. As a girl I am silenced at this school, the staff will do absolutely nothing. They do not care.",,
I was at someone’s house and this boy kept being creepy to everyone. Some others left and I was in a room with him and another person and I was trying to move away from him a lot cause I felt so uncomfortable. Then I sat down further away from him and he followed me. I was really drunk so I didn’t have much control. He was holding me and I couldn’t really move around my neck sort of and saying gross things in my ear. He knew I wasn’t in a state to do anything about it and he was fairly sober,,
"After getting really drunk with my friends on a night out, I took a guy home and we were about to have sex when I asked him to put on a condom. He agreed to put it on. I don't really remember much of what happened other than the feeling of him finishing inside of me and then laughing that he didn't actually put the condom on. He then proceeded to tell me that 'I better be on birth control'. I can still remember the visceral feeling of feeling dirty and used and, when I woke up an hour or so later, he was sleeping with his hand gripping my throat. I had to forcibly unclasp his and from my neck and I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I hated when I would see him at a club after that because I felt so unsafe when he was near.",,
"The amount of times I’ve been followed home is insane it could be 30 degrees in a small dress or after work in -2 wearing a massive jacket. It doesn’t matter what you do there will always be creepy men, fucking disgusting, I was 15 at a hotel and got followed around the swimming pool by a 30-40 year old man who kept trying to talk to me, to later stalking me back to my room and banging on my door. Or even when I’m biking to school and 50 year old men are shouting at me from their vans? I don’t give w fuck anymore I will scream and shout at them, give them the middle finger yet it does nothing. It’s not when will women learn but WHEN WILL MEN LEARN",,
I’ve been harassed sexually assaulted by multiple boys in 7-9th grade currently going into tenth with the fear of all the boys besides some but not much,,
I had been sexually assaulted and had a guy ss my nudes without my permission and was telling lots of people. I told the school but they completely dismissed the part where I was assaulted and said that I should’ve pulled up my top to him. He had no punishment whatsoever and continued to have a clean record. This also plays a part in blatant sexism as I was almost suspended because I had acrylic nails. The guards didn’t do anything when I went to them either.,,
"In year 9, my male classmate came up to me in Maths and grabbed my breasts. He and a friend then laughed at me from across the room. I was mortified and didn't say anything to anyone. I was 13.",,
"I went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], and our brother school was [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] across the road. From the age of 11 [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys would catcall me and make sexual comments to me on the streets on my way home. Even if you told teachers (from either school) nothing would ever be done about it, you just had to endure 5 years of it. Once you got a bit older (year 10 and 11 mainly) things would get worse at parties, with salvo boys making unwanted sexual comments, trying to touch girls and attempting to take advantage of girls, usually those who were drunk and most vulnerable.",,
"When I was in the eighth grade, around 13 years old, I made a guy friend. We would joke around a bit and all was good. That kept going until the jokes started getting more sexual. He would say things about my body, which I already was not comfortable about being insecure about being an “early bloomer”. I decided not to voice how I felt because I thought I was just being overdramatic. These jokes he made also included incest, pedophilia, and sometimes promoted rape culture. He would start getting other guys and sometimes girls involved in it too. The girls would mostly look uncomfortable but the boys found it funny. These jokes kept going on and on and he would sometimes speak about other girls in a sexual manner to me as well. This went on for months until I finally decided to speak to a teacher. She looked concerned and told me the problem would be solved but, nothing happened. He had found out I said something and got mad at me, saying I was overdramatic. I sometimes feel I was just exaggerating but at the same time those “jokes” made me very uncomfortable.",,
"I was at this guy’s house and I was blackout drunk, he made me suck his dick by constantly pushing it into my mouth even though I kept saying no and pushing him away.",,
"In year seven, I was outside at break, i think. I girl from my class kept on staring at my breasts and it made me extremely uncomfortable and understandably upset. She then tried to grope me, I ran away, freaking out and she ran after me. I told the deputy headteacher and she didn't care, didn't even act on it. I havent told my parents or anyone else. I was 12.",,
"I know the focus of these testimonies have been on schools and universities but this continues unto the workplace. ,I worked for a big coffee shop chain in the UK and was sexually assaulted by my co-worker. I was 18 and he was in his mid-20’s. When I spoke to other young girls that had previously worked with him, they all shared similar experiences. ,I blamed myself for so long afterwards because “I could have done this or that” but at the end of the day it was him who ignored me continuously telling him to stop and just forced himself into me. ,I reported him to my work place and my other colleagues all had testimonials against him. My manager didn’t take the proper procedure. I didn’t have any evidence that I had even reported him! We found out later that the company told him that he could leave voluntarily or they would initiate the investigation. He left voluntarily, I don’t even think that it is on his record and he was still able to enter the shops we worked at. ,Later on, one of my colleagues actually filled a police report against him. But at the end of the day it was her word against his and he got away with it. ,This is common place and it impacts so many of us. To this day, I avoid the areas where multiple incidents happened with him. I feel sick whenever I’m near those areas. I become nervous whenever I hear his first name. I cannot watch shows or movies where actors look like him. It’s been over 3 years and it still impacts me.",,
"I met a guy on Bumble, he was teaching/research staff and I was a student in a different faculty. After hanging out a couple of times he came to my place. I found him really forceful and talked to him about it later. He apologised and we dated again. The forcefulness continued. The last night i ever saw him I went to his place. He tore my underwear off against my will and tried to rape me, but he couldn’t maintain an erection to do so. I left his place and pretended nothing had happened. A few weeks later I sent him a message telling him what he did was wrong, and he never replied.",,
"i would be asked out by the boys in my year as a joke, and then laughed at when i would get mad, and was made fun of for having a long skirt in y7.",,
"I was physically assaulted, punched in the stomach, beaten around the head on a busy nightclub dancefloor by a man for refusing to dance with him, kiss him or go to the bathrooms with him. I was 17. He was in his 20s. He was a total stranger.",,
"he was two years older than me, a year eleven at the time, he had me convinced that i was the love of his life, he persuaded me into sending him nudes and then showed all his friends",,
"I was at a park which I always went to, I was with my friend and a man walked into the park as we were walking out. He has his phone low and his eyes on us. This was summer and I was in shorts (not short shorts) and he started taking pictures. We kept walking out of the park, and he started following us. We picked up our pace and he picked up his. He left us alone, but 4 days later we saw the same guy again, but this time he started sprinting after us, crossing roads until a group of 6 ladies in the middle of the pavement scared him off so he didn’t chase us. I dare to think what would happen if those people weren’t there. This was in the middle of the day as well. I am now scared to ever return there.",,
When i was 8 i was repeatedly touched by someone that was close to my family being 10 years older than me,,
"In YR 8 I was coerced into sending naked pictures to a guy in our year. I was so lonely, bullied etc. He’d alludes to the fact he would take me out after. I did it thinking no one would know. It went around the whole school and for months I got comments on my appearance I’d often get shouted at across the school with derogatory comments and how i didn’t look ‘normal’. It crushed me. I left the school shortly after. He and other boys in the year went on to do this with many other girls. They had groups where they would exchange nudes and rate them.",,
"I was in an extremely abusive relationship for 6 years. The first time he raped me we had been on a night out with friends. It was one of our friends birthdays, I hugged him and said happy birthday, this made my boyfriend think I was cheating with him. He must of been putting extra shots in my drink or something because I got drunk very fast. I don’t remember going home, the next thing I remember is waking up half naked with clear signs I had been raped. I got dressed and asked him what he had done. He just looked at me and said ‘Never act like you can replace me’ From there it spiralled, I was now nothing to him. He beat me daily and raped me practically every night. The following rapes were done in such a way it took intensive domestic abuse therapy to see what it was. He didn’t hold me down, he didn’t use physical force. He used mental torture, threats against the kids and he would smash the house up, it became an understanding that if I said no they would be consequences. I thought all rape was violent, until it happened to me. He got away with what he did because it all fell to my word against his. If you are reading this and even suspect someone close to you is trapped in a bad relationship please help them. Police can run Clare’s law, it discloses information that could prevent someone suffering at the hands of a known domestic abuse perpetrator. Listen to their exes because I’m telling you most of the time they are not crazy, it’s the truth. I wouldn’t want anyone so suffer what I did.",,
One of my family members took advantage of my young stupid self,,
"I was around Grade 4 or Grade 5 back that time. My mom went downstairs to took a bath while I was up in our room watching TV. I heard the door open and I thought it was my mom, so I pretended to be asleep. When I feel the presence of the person getting closer I started getting a feeling that it wasn’t my mom because she wasn’t talking at all. I kept pretending to be asleep because I thought my mom just didn’t want to wake me up, and that’s when I felt that my blanket was getting removed. I felt that my bottoms were being removed so I immediately opened my eyes and there I saw my mom’s boyfriend. I immediately went down and told my mom everything that happened. Up until now, I’m still hurt and angry. I trusted him, I was ready to accept him as my second father but then that happened. I’m also hurt because my mom still sees him up until now. I just want to move out tbh but I can’t because I’m still a minor.",,
"I was sexually assaulted on a band trip under their care. They did nothing. They threatened to suspend me if I didn’t tell them what happened and then allowed him to walk free. I fell asleep and woke up to his hand under my dress, touching me. It was traumatizing and they continued to put me in classes with him after that. They did nothing. Nothing. They punished /me/. Teachers talked shit about /me/. I was excluded, not him.",,
"When I was 13, a group of boys made very sexual jokes and forced us to talk about and do sexual things that I didn’t see were wrong at the time. Looking back, they were pretty bad. I have reason to believe that our school is full of sexual harassment and rapists and the school just turns a blind eye.",,
"I was 13 when it first happened. Me and this girl were having a sleepover (pretty normal for us) and we were just chilling out. Next thing i know she's asking all these questions about if i've ever kissed anyone or if i still had my virginity. I told her it was making me uncomfortable and we moved on, but a few hours later she started acting really sexual (like touching me in places i said no and trying to kiss me after i pushed her away multiple times). Things escalated and she ended up manipulating me to let her give me hickeys and touching her when i didn't want to. It's taken me years to even recognise this as a form of assault because of the stereotype of ""stuff can't happens to guys you need to be a big strong man"". Anything can happen to anyone. I was just a kid and this happened for multiple years until i realised what was going on. School didn't do anything. My parents didn't believe me. I was alone. And i'm sad to say it still stays with me today, the trauma, the sudden jump when someone puts a hand on me. i'm sorry to anyone else whose experienced this.",,
This guy I had spoken to for a little while came over to mine. Later that evening he started to make a move on me. He very shortly after that stood infront of me with his dick out expecting me to suck him off. Whilst this happened he was choking me quite hardly and slapped me and called me names. I was very shocked and uncomfortable by this especially as my parents were next door. I never directly told him to stop because I didn’t realise how wrong this was. I thought that maybe this was normal and that I should’ve enjoyed it. This happened and few times after this and he would never ask for consent to do anything or ask if I was ok. I didn’t seem to think much of it I jus thought I would become used to it. After we stopped talking I was made to feel guilty that I made that choice being told that he harmed himself on multiple times because of it. Only recently do I realise how messed up it was. I felt like because I never told him to stop I couldn’t blame him for any of it. I was so uncomfortable with everything that went on. I didn’t want to tell anyone because I thought I was overreacting but it has caused me a lot of stress to think that I thought it was ok for someone to treat me like that. At 16yrs old no girl should think that this is what a relationship should look like.,,
"I was groped twice by two different people at my school who were in the year above. Once on my birthday and once at a party. When one of them was confronted by my friend who he had also groped, he said that ‘he didn’t remember’. My brain refused to accept what had happened until other girls told me that the same thing had happened to them as well, and I felt so dirty and sick to my stomach.",,
I was hooking up with a guy after a night out who I had just met that night. We started to have consensual sex and changed position to be in doggy and I could not see what he was doing. We were having sex for a while and then he put his penis in my anus which caused excruciating pain and I started to cry. He didnt apologise and I realised after we stopped he had also taken the condom off without telling me. I was too scared to tell him to leave because he didn't seem to think he had done anything wrong. Its not until a couple of years later that I realised that this was a type of rape and how messed up it was of him.,,
While I was a student I had a brief relationship with a university GP who had treated me early on in my course. We were physically intimate but I was unsure about having sex. He was very keen to go further. I said I wanted to be sure he was interested in me and not just my body. He said ‘I do respect you which is why I haven’t force you to have sex’. (Would he have forced me if he hadn’t respected me?) Then he dumped me.,,
a boy at our school has made an instagram account rating a load of girls at our school on their body and their ‘best bits’. They include things like ‘big tits’ ‘arse’ and ‘fuckable.,,
when i was 7 my brother raped me and sexually abused me. I didn’t know it was wrong then and i haven’t told anyone i’m so scared of what people will think or that people might think i’m making it up. It has affected my life a lot and it’s hard to accept compliments or any type of affection due to this and i feel so horrible not being able to accept hugs from my friends it all just reminds me of those few months where he touched me. as a result of this i started cutting myself to try and distract me from those thoughts. i’m 4 days clean now,,
"When I was fifteen and high for the first time I was giving a boy a blow job and his friend walked in and took a photo which he sent around to all their friends. The guy I was with thought it was so funny and said the only thing he was embarrassed about was the fact that I was so ugly - I have never been so ashamed/embarrassed as the next week at school when I was treated as such a slut and told I must have conned him into being with me because I was less attractive than him, whilst he got off Scott free",,
I mostly date online so I met this guy through a couple friends we quickly hit it off we did something called phone sex a week after I started dating he wanted me to send him pictures I told him no repeatedly but he kept pressuring me into it to the point I sent them and felt bad he would make me turn on my camera and show him my chest ask me for ass pictures I didn't like it I made that very clear I said no multiple times but he kept pressuring me into it making me feel bad so I ended up sending him the pictures and doing the video this is happened to me before when I was 12 I was groomed by a 27 year old he made me send him pictures guy pressuring me into it I just I hate this and I feel for everybody who went through this,,
"he was my first ever proper boyfriend. he came across as really nice, very very chatty and my parents liked him. i went to stay at his for a few days, he tried to start touching me when we were kissing, i’d push his hands away and tell him no. every single time, he’d ignore me and try again. i quickly learnt it didn’t matter that i didn’t want to, he wanted it and he wasn’t going to stop. so i let him. it happened a couple of times until i jokingly mentioned it to my friends. i hadn’t realised it was wrong until i saw their faces. i still kept seeing him, it kept happening, i kept telling him he shouldn’t be doing that to me, but he’d make me feel so bad for getting justifiably upset at him. it only stopped when i refused to see him again. he currently goes to [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], has a girlfriend, probably has a good group of friends, he’s faced no consequences for what he did to me and he probably never will.",,
"I was out for a night out in [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with a group of friends. We were drinking and having fun and I started talking to a guy in the smoking area. I don’t remember much after that, just small flashes. When I asked my friends about the night later, they said they saw this guy wearing a [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] hoodie, holding me up, walking me out and a couple of my friends stopped us, telling him to let go and leave me with them. He said he was just making sure I got home safe in a cab so they left us. The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning with him on top of me in an unfamiliar room, trying to push him off. He sped up and carried on until he had finished. I got up, grabbed my things and left.",,
"I want to second the things that have been written here about [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. For 6 years of my life I have been repeatedly told to not have my skirt too short because it ""distracts the male teachers"", genuinely making me fear going up the stairs in case someone looked up my skirt. The school on the whole seemed to have some disposition for teachers who abused their power. An example that I often think about is the predatory maths teacher who used to give the girls backrubs during his lessons. One time my friend was so scared to go into her maths lesson that she hid in the bathroom crying.",,
"When I was 15, I was making out with my boyfriend and things started to go further. He wanted me to give him a blowjob but I didn’t want to. He first made me feel guilty for not wanting to and eventually I gave in. After a while I realised how wronf that was and tried to stop. He then pushed my head down and forced me to. When he finished he asked me why I was crying, and didn’t understand why I would be upset. He told me that if I really hadn’t wanted to I would have fought back more. When I told my closest friend she told me it’s not a big deal because it’s not rape, and that no one would believe it was assault because we were dating at the time and I’d said yes on other occasions. Afterwards the boy was really nice to me and acted like nothing had happened. My friends dismissal and his ‘politeness’ fooled me into thinking I was the one being overdramatic and that I was in the wrong. It took me a long to admit to myself that it wasn’t okay what that boy did to me. Assault within relationships is so normalised it almost goes unnoticed.",,
I was in 1st period class my sophomore year. One of my good guy friends thought i liked him back and he proceeded to put his hand where it didn’t belong. I was frozen in the moment and didn’t know what to do or say so i just let it happen.,,
I think I was sexually assaulted by my cousins when I was 7.,,
This guy in my year would “accidentally” send girls dick pics on snapchat and he would say “don’t open the snap i sent it by accident” by saying that it meant that he could blame the girls if they report him.,,
I was stood in a queue waiting with my friends to get our coats back after a club night when three men walked past. One grabbed between my legs and the other two did nothing. They all walked away and it destroyed me.,,
A specific boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] gets extremely drunk at motives and tries to touch girls and make them do stuff for him. He knows exactly who he is and there’s way too many girls that have been victims of him.,,
"A guy from my old school messaged me on snap out of the blue a couple months ago and we started talking again and it was going well, we were just being friendly. Then out of nowhere he told me he liked me but I was confused about whether he was just taking the piss and then he suddenly said he was joking. We stopped talking for a while but he messaged again and stuff seemed fine but then he started sending me really weird messages like saying he could ‘slytherin’ to my mouth. There were quite a few like this but I kept half swiping and after a while he would delete them and I kept hoping he would realise it was a mistake but it happened like three times. Then he messaged me randomly telling me how big his dick is and asking if it was too small. I was just like okay you’re making me uncomfortable and he ignored it.",,
"I was 13 years old and with a small group of friends, had a bit of alcohol. I started kissing a guy from the year above who suddenly had pulled his dick out with a boner without me realising. He grabbed my head and wouldn’t stop pushing me down trying to convince me to give him head ‘come on, it’s fine, don’t be such a tease’ even though I kept saying ‘no’ and pulling away. Eventually two other guys arrived and asked what was going on. He let me go and I burst into tears and the others took me away. When I got to my best friend all she (another 13 year old) said ‘it’s fine that’s just what guys do’. After that all I remember is that I was the one who was embarrassed about what happened. Embarrassed that I overreacted and cried.",,
He was my best friend of nearly 3 years when it happened. I had just been broken up with so i was very emotionally vulnerable and he knew that too but i knew he had started to catch feelings for me as people had told me. We were at a party and he got blackout drunk because he didn’t want to see me knowing i didn’t like him in that way back. Bear in mind we were 13 at the time. My friend was having a panic attack outside due to something else that had happened but i went to help her then i came back inside to the party where i saw him stumble towards me and corner me in a place where not a lot of people could see. He started hugging me which i was fine with as he was my best friend but then it started to become too long and he was massive compared to me. He started to move his hands down my back and i tried to move them back up but he wouldn’t put them back up and he started trying to put his hands up my skirt and into my bra and i was telling him to get off but he couldn’t hear me because of the loud music. I started screaming at him and trying to push him off of me but i couldn’t because he was too strong. He proceeded to do things to me which i couldn’t stop all whilst i was trying to get him off of me and screaming at him. He started pulling my hair and trying to get my on the floor which absolutely terrified me but luckily my friend saw what was happening and got him off me and he took him somewhere else and another one of my girl friends came over and took me to the toilets and we talked and cried and i was in absolute shock. The rest of the party i couldn’t comprehend what had happened and at the end of the party he asked to walk me back to my car which i obviously said no and he gave me a hug and kissed me on the cheek. Everyone said we looked so cute together but they had no idea what had happened earlier on. I was absolutely crushed i felt like nothing. When i got in the car with my mum i just immediately broke down and told her what happened. She asked if i wanted to get the police involved but i said no because i was too scared. The next morning he started talking to me like nothing had happened. He didn’t remember what happened because he was black out drunk. The whole thing was terrible as he doesn’t know it happened and i feel like it’s gaslighted me so much. It took me nearly a month to allow my own mum to give me a hug and i’ve been to therapy for it since.,,
I was on my way to school by school bus which had students from other schools. I was sitting at the back minding my own business sitting down next to a student from another school where I suddenly felt a leg stroke hard against mine. I didn’t say anything and pretend that I did not even feel it or wanted to react. Another time on the same school bus I was sitting opposite this same person and they kept on showing a lot of their “assets” which you could clearly tell I was ignoring. In the end I changed my route back from school.,,
"When I was eleven years old (in year seven) I was sexually harassed by a boy in my year group. we were lining up to go into a lesson and he was waiting to go into his classroom, he came over to me and started talking to me in ways which already made me uncomfortable. He then put his hand up my skirt and touched my bum. I froze, he had done that in a corridor full of people and no one said anything.,""My ex boyfriend who I had been seeing on and off for about 2 years offered to give me a lift home after a night out. We dropped a friend off first and then it was just me and him in the car. I was very drunk and made a comment which he didn’t appreciate and he hit me in the leg. I told him it hurt and said that he’d never have the chance to hurt me again because we would never be alone together again. A few minutes later he pulled into a street which was not mine and when I asked what he was doing he put me in a headlock, forced my head down towards his crotch and said he could beat me up then if he wanted to. He let go and drove me the rest of the way home. Apparently because I laughed after it happened out of sheer shock I was lying about what happened and he was completely baffled as to why I cut him out of my life because he “meant it as a joke”.",,
"At the secondary school in Scotland. I had started to send nudes. This soon went around and screenshots I had sent to a friend of sexual conversations and people started to say to me things like ""would u suck me off for fags"" people also started to make fake accounts to get nudes from me.",,
"We were about a month into year 8. I'd gotten an hour for lateness. I sat down, at the back, and a boy I didn't really know (in my year but not my class, or at least my main class) sat next to me. I didn't think anything of it. I got my book out and started reading. He said hi or something, I waved a bit with my hand but i didn't want to talk and get in more trouble. He kept trying to talk to me and i just said sorry i don't wanna get in trouble. He started poking me and I just ignored him. That's when he touched my thigh. I batted his hand away and told him to get off. He did it again, and again. Under the skirt this time. I kept telling him to stop and he wouldn't. I didn't know what to do. I just froze. I felt trapped and i was really scared. Saying no was just making it worse. So I gave up and hoped he'd get bored. He didn't. I kept shifting but he wasn't stopping. He started touching my chest. I told him to stop again now. But it was the same, it just made it worse, like it fuelled him. I couldn't take it and i tried to get him off but then he grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch. I know I should have gone, i should have moved, or said something, or ran, not put up with it for an hour. I think about it everyday. I only just told people about it, it happened in i think [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and I only told people in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] after i broke down when consent came up as a cpshe topic and the teacher sent me to someone. The day after i realised he was in my mixed classes and broke down when i saw him, but i didn't feel like it was enough. I thought it wasn't bad enough like i couldn't say anything, but it was still affecting me months later. The school told my parents who weren't mean about it but just said what i already knew and regretted which kinda made me feel worse but i guess they didn't mean to. It's just changed me, it scarred me. I used to be fine, really good in public. I could walk down the street or travel without even thinking about or noticing people. Now, I'm terrified of everyone. I think it just opened my eyes up and now i cant see the same. If I'm on the train, I get off at the last second just in case someone tries to follow me. I carry keys in my hands. I check my shoulder. I avoid everyone and everything. I'm so paranoid. I don't know why it has to be like this.",,
My boyfriend sexually harassed me and forced me to do stuff I didn’t want to do. When he left I was crying because I thought he was different and I didn’t realise that fact he was so god damn disgusting. He made me strip naked infront of him and he highlighted all my insecurities.,,
Sexually assaulted and abused by my best friend at the time. Went to the same school as me. I had no idea the reality of what was going on until afterwards. They would physically assault me if I didn’t finish quick enough and get angry at me if I was too tired for sex. I was thrown into walls and slapped.,,
"I was at a party and got pretty drunk and was coerced into leaving the room with a boy I had recently been talking to, he fingered me several times even though I was obviously uncomfortable and ask him to stop. He told me I was ok and continued. I was in a lot of pain the next day and couldn’t close my legs. Throughout the experience he justified it by telling me how much he was into me and that he couldn’t see a problem.",,
I was sexually assaulted in my first term at university. I went out with some friends and their flats (whom I hadn’t met before). The last thing I remember was being in the club and saying I was too drunk and needed to go home. I woke up the next morning in bed and thought nothing of it. It was only four days later that a friend told me this boy had taken me home and we’d had sex. It’s been a very traumatising and difficult experience to come to terms with and has hugely affected my relationship with alcohol and with sex.,,
I use to have this 1 particular boy in school who used to grab my bum and my boobs often. It happened with a couple other guys aswell but not necessarily on a frequent basis like this one,,
When I was around 13/14 in year 9 I was mates with this boy and he was always a bit flirty and touchy but I didn't think much of it. One day we were in a park and there wasn't anyone there. He started getting more and more touchy and I played it off as a joke but I was super uncomfortable. Then it escalated really quickly and he kept trying to grab my chest and pull down my top. He was really persistent despite telling him i was uncomfortable and to stop. He tried to pin me down at points and as soon as i was free I remember running away and crying on my way home. I didn't speak to him again after and haven;t seen him since and have heard similar stories about the same boy.,,
He would touch me under the table higher and higher no matter how many times I would tell him to stop,,
"It started of with us just randomly talking over social media, we both knew each other because we were in the same year and one of the same classes. I decided to start talking to him because he seemed sweet, and after a week of talking I felt bad. Because he went through a lot but now I don’t know what was true. I told him I liked him and he said he liked me back, he invited me over and while I was there he was messaging an ex which he told me that she was spreading rumours about him which made me more sorry. The next day he started dating the same ex which hurt a little bit I got over it quick. A week went by without a message and suddenly one day he messaged me saying his girlfriend broke up with him so I tried to comfort him. Two weeks went by then we started dating. I realised he was a little clingy at first which wasn’t to bad but over time he would always want me to hang out with him. One day we decided to hang out with my friends and after a few hours we sat on the bench talking and then he started getting pushy. I hadn’t kissed him at all for the amount of time we where dating which was only three weeks. At the park he kept saying ‘they did it, look it’ll be quick’ until I gave in because of the pressure. I wanted it to be when I felt comfortable but I didn’t. Another week or two passed of us dating. I was then sat in his bed watching tv with him and that’s when he started to get touchy and started reaching down to my trousers. I whispered because I’m the type of person that can’t say no ‘I can’t’ and so he replied with ‘okay’ and then a hour went by until he started it again. I reached for his hand to stop him but he continued. I didn’t say no but I didn’t say yes, I said nothing because I gave up. We had sex and then I left by myself like always. He never walked me back to my house, it was always what pleased him. I thought nothing of it. The next day I went to school and told two of my friends and we laughed it off. Another week passed with the small touches. Everywhere I went he followed along. Every chair I sat in he was right next to me or literally touching my side. After another week I wouldn’t handle how clingy he became and how possessive he was and so he dumped him. Just less than a week two girls came up to me ‘girls I don’t talk to’ and walked me to a quiet place and said he had been telling people we did have sex. I thought he was mistreated by everyone but in the end he always played the victim. Before we started dating he told me he had sex with older girl which I didn’t care about, I saw him from the mask he put up. It took me 3 months over the ‘rumour’ for me to realise what had actually happened and then I spent more time overthinking it over and over. I was 14.",,
"I went to this guys house for a study session and because I knew him for most secondary he trusted him, but a while into our talk he started to finger me, I felt to so helpless and scared that I let it happen. Afterwards he bragged to his friends about it and slut shamed me to our entire school and everyone including some of my friends never saw me the same way",,
"i was touched, forced into a relationship i didnt want to be in. it was toxic. he said if i told anyone that he would hurt me. i was so scared.",,
It makes me so angry that when people are in a couple it makes them think they have the right to do what they want to the others body. And they dont even realise that it was wrong. My ex boyfriend would rape me but it was in a way that he thought it was okay so now he will never think he did anything wrong. Educate your sons.,,
"At around the age of 12 years old I used to play out on the street with 'friends'. While playing running about, the boys repeatedly pinned me to the ground and pulled my tops up exposing and wobbling my breasts whilst I struggled. This even happened once in one of their homes with one of their mothers pottering around. She must've heard what was happening. I naively tried to make it too difficult for them to do this by putting on layers of tops, which of course did not work. I did not want to make a fuss about something they seemed to view as normal and I wanted to fit in. The effects of this has lasted all my life.",,
I was raped,,
Could not count the amount of times I have shared a bed with a supposed friend and they have been so handsy and I have had to pretend to be asleep to not make our friendship awkward,,
"I shared an intimate video with my partner at the time, who sent the video around to all his friends. I was consistently bullied for it (even by the girls) and it followed me all the way until my final year of secondary school.",,
"I was drunk during a night out at the [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I went home with a boy (another [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] student) and when I got to his room I realised that I was drunker than I thought and I was going to pass out, throw up or both at the same time. I remember telling him no several times and asking him to stop, but I was so drunk I couldn't move my body. I eventually passed out during it and I can't remember what happened after that. I woke up the next day and went home and didn't tell anyone for a year. I couldn't have intimate relationships from then on but I was in denial that what happened that night was the reason why. Eventually I started a relationship with a great guy but was experiencing symptoms of PTSD, so he urged me to seek help from the University counseling service and the NHS. I went to the first meeting with a counselor at Uni after 3 months waiting. When I got there, she said that my issue was two big of a problem to deal with and that they can't help me. She left me with a leaflet on PTSD and told me to read that. I felt completely helpless and rejected by the University. The NHS placed me on the waiting list but 2 years later I haven't heard anything. Eventually i managed to get help from an amazing charity in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. But the fact that the University was so unwilling to help was appalling.",,
"On [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], me and my friend were joking around and he was taking videos of me walking. It was fine until he stole my bag and said it was another person who didn’t know me. I was concerned and my friend told me that he stole it which confused me at the time. He “found” my bag and was very persistent on me getting it myself. I went to get it and my heart sunk. I turned around when i was about to get it and his phone went right at my lower body. I told him to stop filming me, but still filmed me bending over after I said no. I threw out that skirt a while later, but I never told anyone it was because of what happened. I was so scared to speak about it, and I wish I wasn’t because he never got in trouble for it. He seemed like a nice guy, but I guess some “nice guys” are the exact opposite.",,
I was 14 so i didnt really understand much about it and he was older than me and persuaded me to meet him one day. I said yes to kissing but he wouldnt stop after that despite me saying no. I used to blame myself because i had said yes at the start,,
"I was 14 and off to a year aboves party at a friend of a friends quite swanky house. My friend and I were both quite humbled to b invited, and very nervous, so we both drank quite a bit before arriving. We had both dressed up and were ready to let our hair down, meet new people and have a great time. Progressively drank more from nerves and general social anxiety, and that weird power imbalance I felt between myself and they year above boys. I was introduced to a guy, and we got off. He led me downstairs and fingered me, to which I told him to stop several times. He then asked me to give him a blowjob to which I said no and ran upstairs. He acted all hurt and pissed off, and I sort of forgot about it. I kept drinking and got pass-out drunk. He approached me again and asked again if I would go down on him, and I told him no probably about 10 times. He waited for me to get more drunk and separate from my mates, then picked me up and locked me in the bathroom and ‘asked’ for me to give him head. I said no, no, no, but he had locked the door and I was too afraid to yell or move really, so I did it. The fact I had to say no more than once is disgusting. I told my male friends the next day, and at first they were really supportive, but they then approached him at school, heard a ‘completely different story’, in which I had consented, and then attacked me on social media. I felt so ashamed, confused and isolated. If I couldn’t even talk to my mates about it, who the hell could I talk to. Even my female mates didn’t really want to get involved, because I was notoriously the ‘wild child’ of the group and ‘was asking for it’ for a long time. People, both boys and girls, treated it as some penance I was destined to face at some point in time. It was awful. I tried to brush it aside for so long, and had to see him at parties again. It is ingrained in who I am today, and not a day will pass without thinking about it.",,
"I was raped when I was 12. I was in my school uniform. It was a stranger and I didn't tell anyone, until I told my friend in year 11. I never really feel safe any more. I feel like my childhood got taken away from me. He called me a slut, a whore, a slag, pretty much every type of misogynistic name there is. Every time a guy calls me or another girl those names I remember what happened. It's been five years and I'm still not over it but each year it gets easier. I want girls who have been through the same to know that it isn't their fault. And it will get better even if it's not okay all the time.",,
"I was staying after school to complete some revision because my house at home was always loud and there’s no way I could concentrate. I was approached by this new teacher, who I think taught maths who asked me if I needed a lift home. I declined, as I only lived a matter of minutes walk away. He insisted and refused to leave my side until he lead me to his car. He brought a chair up next to me and sat almost on top of me. Over the next 5 minutes I felt his hand slide up my leg and finally underneath my skirt. I told him to stop but he wouldn’t. He lead me to his car, his arms behind my back basically pushing me to go with him. He took me the “quickest route for this time of day” back to my house, but I knew it wasn’t. He took me to this empty carpark by some old abandoned office building next to some overgrown field. That’s the day where I lost my virginity. To a newly-employed maths teacher. I tried to tell my Mom but she wouldn’t listen, she said all I was saying was lies and I just wanted some attention. But what she doesn’t realise is that, almost 3 years on from that, I’m still scarred to go back into school, back into public just if that happens again. For the past 3 years I’ve suffered in silence and nobody knows what happened and the school just refused to listen.",,
"I once went on a first date with a man and afterwards we went back to his place and we started to have consensual sex. In the middle of it he turned me over and started to have anal sex with me without asking it was painful and unlubricated and the entire time I was thinking in my head that I wished it would stop. He was a lot bigger than I am and much physically stronger so I didn’t want to tell him no because, not knowing him that well and how he might react, I was scared he might get angry and continue with something worse. Afterwards I felt sick and disgusted with myself and didn’t want to be there anymore but felt I couldn’t leave because it was the middle of the night. He seemed like a nice and normal guy on the date, and I had wanted to sleep with him. The next day I wasl bleeding from around my butthole",,
"I was at a party and this boy kept on putting his hand in my shorts. I was pushing his hand away and telling him to stop. He then said I’m quite persuasive aren’t I."",And I feel like one of the luckier ones..... I’m almost 40 years old and the incidents still occur weekly.,Some may be inadvertent, but all the same still wrong.",,
"When I was 12 I was pressured into sending a boy nudes and taught to over sexualise myself at an extremely tender age. Those nudes were then leaked making me the victim of persistent slut shaming, bullying and harassment from other boys to send nudes as I was now considered that easy girl who will give you nudes. People would send me messages not only about how I was a “slut” but also how I was going to “burn in hell”, as well as insensitive remarks made about my race. I was then blackmailed by a boy who would grope me and if I asked him to stop or was rude to him in anyway he said he would tell people in my circle about “what I had done”. Eventually everyone found out and this perpetual continued until I moved schools 1 term into year 9. The shame and humiliation still haunts me to the point I developed serve mental health issues. No one ever defended me or really tried to help me, even people I believed to be my close friends.",,
"my ex was always pressurising me into have sex ever since we did it once. it made me feel guilty and i often gave in, just because i didn’t want him to break up with me for not doing ‘normal couple things’. in the end i realised i couldn’t keep going in this circle of saying no and then giving in so i ended it. it’s only now tho that i’ve realised that it’s not right as rape in relationships is still not that normalised. everyone assumes that to be raped you have to be kidnapped in a dark alley by a stranger but the people closest to us can also do it. that’s why it took me so long to realise, i thought it was okay and since i said yes once, it would be okay. but it’s very not okay.",,
"when i was nine i was sexually assaulted by my uncle. he felt in places that are private and especially not to be shared with a family member. the night after it happened he hung himself. for three years i sat with the guilt of his death on my shoulders. i thought it was my fault he died. i thought that if i said anything they would blame me, three years later i told a few close friends. later that year the word got out about what happened. someone started a hate page calling me a whore who deserved what happened to me. i told my mom earlier this year. she never questioned me and automatically believed me. my story is not one that is important or even that special, but its one that can be shared.",,
I was in year 7 and my first “boyfriend” if you even want to call it that. It wasn’t a proper relationship just a kids one - we hadn’t even kissed. The boys at school kept asking if I was going to let him fuck me for his birthday and to make sure I let him go ‘balls deep’ laughing about it then making horrible hand actions. After his birthday they kept asking if we had had sex and I said no... I was 11ish.,,
Eh Im a boy & I was basically kinda groomed by a 6th former when we were on a school trip activities week thing. Which is kinda weird considering she was like idk 17 and I must have been like 14. None of it was un-consensual by any means but still always striked me as a bit odd. It was one of my first sexual experiences and the first time I ever had sex was with her when we got back to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] from the trip.,,
I am married to someone who is living a double life . He is one person for his family and someone else for his friends and colleagues. When I got pregnant with my first child he would pin me down and rape me . That was my punishment for getting pregnant although I did explain that I have POS and I thought I would need help to get pregnant. When I cried and said to him why are you doing this to me ; He replies : Oh baby I just love to come . It has been 13 years since then and I still haven’t found the courage to leave him . I did go to all these helping places but I never felt trust enough to let them help . They seemed like they can’t be bothered..,,
I went to a school where if you said no to a boy u were labelled as frigid and if you said yes you were a slag. There was no in between. I was 15 at a party and two boys had bet money on seeing who could get with me first. One of them was my friend and the other I didn’t like (it was his idea). I got with my friend outside behind a shed where we weren’t visible. I was drunk but not so drunk that I wasn’t aware of what was going on. He sat me down on the ground and he sat behind me and wouldn’t let me get up. And he forced his way into my pants and I said “no” and I said it multiple times. But he wouldn’t let me move and proceeded to force finger me. A group of people walked past the shed and heard me and I was so embarrassed. One of the guys that walked past even said “she said no mate”. I wasn’t aware of how bad it was until I was older.,,
I was sexually assaulted in the 7/8th grade repeatedly by the same classmate during the bus rides home. I never sat next to him i always made sure to sit next to a friend he would always sit behind me and my bus driver refused to let me switch seats for whatever reason. This all happened towards the front of the bus where the bus driver was able to see it go on. She never told him to stop or got him in trouble even though i would beg for him to stop and to leave me alone.,,
"When I was about 7 Years old, I was at my grandparents house for a family dinner, I went upstairs to the spare room and fell asleep, I woke up to my cousin undressing me and touching me, I kicked him and ran to the bathroom, waiting for everybody to leave. When I was walking home again at the age of 11, I saw him and he grabbed me. I managed to shout for help and luckily a man I knew saw me, but even to this day it haunts me and I feel like I’m going to end up seeing him again.",,
"When I was 13 years old I was almost raped in a bathroom stool by a much older man, I believe he was around 30/35. I didnt see him follow me in but as i entered the stool he followed and closed the stool, i was wearing a skirt so he tried to pull my underwear down and turn me around to push me against the wall but I was flailing my legs so he gave up and instead pushed me, grabbed my head and forced head. It only stopped because another women entered the bathroom and heard, he left quickly and no questions were asked. On another occasion in my own school another boy slapped my ass as he walked past me on a non school uniform day and he also 'pussy slapped' me and multiple other girls, he was also a known rapist, we told the school but they did nothing, he was also head boy and remained head boy.",,
"This happened when I was in 1st yr (13 years old). I had a boyfriend who I thought I liked a lot, and who I thought I trusted. We went to the beach near his house together one day and he took me into a cave. He then raped me and only stopped when I was crying and screaming. I was so young and I didn’t understand what had happened completely, but I didn’t want it to happen again, but I thought I love him so I went back to see him the next week, only I brought a friend with me cause I thought it would make it safer and he wouldn’t do anything. I was wrong. We all went to KFC, and while sitting there he put his hand on my thigh and slowly moved it up and into my pants I didn’t say anything cause I was to embarrassed of being in a public space and didn’t want to cause a fuss or anything. When we left he wanted to climb up a cliff so I said I’d go with him but my friend refused to go so I went up with him alone, the same thing happened as had happened in KFC. After that I told one of my friends some of it and he convinced me to break up with him. Two years later I fully realised what had happened and the pain was so strong. It’s hard to sit through lessons about sexual assault or even about sex. My current boyfriend knows what’s happened and doesn’t pressure me into anything, but sometimes I just can’t tell him when I don’t wanna because I’m scared he’ll be annoyed, I know he won’t but I don’t wanna make him sad. Everyone stay strong. You can do this.",,
"When I was 14, my best friend drugged me and then raped me in another friends house - there was only 8 of us there. He then left and told the others he didn’t feel well and that I was asleep upstairs. I became fully conscious again a few hours later and my mum picked me up at 11pm - no one knew what had happened until I told some friends a few years on. It’s exactly 4 years today since it happened. I never reported it as I was too scared and knew the system is set against victims even at such a young age.",,
Some of the boys in our year have a group chat where they send screen shot girls instagrams and tiktok and share girls nudes to wank to. If we complain they tell us we should take it as a compliment.,,
"I was about 15 waiting at the bus stop in my school uniform, and some man said to me that he ""hopes I have shaved"" as he stood in the shelter next to me. I changed my bus route home to make sure he didn't follow me so he wouldn't know where I lived. Pretty scary.",,
"i’m a girl from new york and i went to this guys house. he didn’t leave near me he lived a few towns over but i went to his house IN TEARS. he told me he’d help me and make me feel better. but the next second he is trying to take of my clothes. i’m telling him no and to not do it. i tried to fight back and he grabbed my hands and tied them. then he just did it, he raped me.",,
I was 14 at the time In my maths class we had a cover teacher for the last few weeks the last day of term he called he back after class and started to touch my leg he then told me he would see me tomorrow and to keep my mouth shut of h me hurt my family this happened for a few months,,
when i was in year 8 i was sat next to a boy in class and he touched me in areas i didn't want to be touched i told my teacher and things got sorted out but we were good friends and it's just makes me feel sick,,
I was in the bathroom. A boy came in and he pinned me down. I screamed and punched. And he tried to take my clothes off. I got suspended for violence and he got nothing.,,
"One night at a party I started talking to a boy I had been flirting with. I knew that he expected something to happen and I was excited because I really liked him. At this point you always expect to have a positive experience and never imagine just how different they begin to act once they know they have you under their control alone in a room. Throughout the night he became increasingly more drunk and with every drink, more aggressive. I remember how much his sudden bursts of violence started to unsettle me but no one stopped him as ‘it always happened when he got drunk’. Even when I would try to distance myself by sitting with other people he would find me, and every time I tried to get up to get away from him he would grab me and force me down, often yelling at me. Luckily I managed to avoid anything more serious and he apologies to me the next day, but I’ll never forget how objectified and degraded I felt.",,
I briefly worked in an Indian restaurant and a member of staff used to brush his arm across my breasts at any given opportunity. He would suddenly need a plate from near where I was standing or need something from the top shelf when I was getting something from another shelf. He and the other men would look at me and laugh and speak their own language.,,
"Well to start of there was this guy in my year who I thought was a Friend until I found out he had a crush on me and things went down hill from here. He would purposely through balls to me and look up my skirt, first time I thought I was an accident until it happened a 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th time, but the 5th time was when he purposely touch my backside. The 2nd time a friend witnessed when I was playing football, 3rd and 4th time happens in PE and he would ‘fall to the ground’ under me, and without a surprise he looked up my skirt, and again the whole team saw it. I felt disgusted and I personally wanted out of my life for good. I never reported it because I saw the way my school had handled previous sexual assault cases. To make sure it wasn’t ok what he did I told the whole school and everytime someone walked passed him he would get the worst looks he ever had. It got to the point when I told my parents and they brought it up with his parents and they said they will talk to him about it, and according to them he got told of real bad. But did he really? He came in school the next day and he as smiling and I got a simple sorry as I walked passed. Did they talk to him about it or out him in his place? He seemed almost like he was amused.",,
"A boy in my PE class decided to make up 'nicknames' for all of the girls in the class during a hockey lesson, including ""rug muncher"", ""prozzie b*tch"" and ""lezzer"".",,
"I am a female teacher and I feel completely helpless and vulnerable in my setting. I have comments made about my body, threats, comment in the corridors etc. I feel completely unsupported and people make comments such as “well you’re a young, pretty girl you’ve got to expect these things”. I feel unsafe to the point I’ve started having nightmares :( I fear reporting it because I think it will somehow be made out to be my fault.",,
"“what we’re you wearing?”- and most people expect me to say a short dress or tight shorts, but since when have my clothes been an invitation to sexual harassment let alone the “sacred” school uniformity wore. “Where were you”- no i wasn’t at a club or a party or walking alone down the street not that my whereabouts are an invitation to sexual harassment but i was at the back of my food tech class. “did you say the word no”- it seems to me that when people say ‘actions speak louder than words’ they were not referring to me pushing his hand away or squeezing my legs closed or the tears brimming in my eyes, since when was my non verbal communication an invitation to sexual harassment. All of this does not fall on the fault of myself and other victims but rather the ever heavily unforced misogyny and lack of humanity, respect, and care towards others, specifically women.",,
"I had a fellow male student crawl into my bedroom at 3 am and lay on my bed for over an hour. I was petrified and couldn't move, fortunately this didn't progress to physical contact but I was petrified.",,
"So freshman year i dated this guy, and he was cheating on me the whole time. it was the first football game of the year and i was on my period and i felt like throwing up. and he took me away from everyone onto the soccer field. i thought he was just being nice and helping me out. the field was by the woods and there was these big rocks next to it basically seperating the the field and the woods. i sat on one of the rocks and was taking some deep breaths so i didnt throw up. he got close to me and started unbuttoning my shorts. i told him no because he was on my period and he told me ""shut up and let me do what i want like the little slut you are"". he then proceeded to take my shorts off and bent me over the rock, i was screaming no i dont want to. he got just the tip in before i was able to get him off and pull my pants off and walk away.",,
I was a 7th grader. And someone who I thought was my friend. She would constantly touch me everyday. No matter how many times I told her to stop she wouldn’t. And she made dirty jokes about it and I never really knew what it meant. Because well I was a kid. She got away with it too. We went to court and they said there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute or something like that. Most people don’t hear of a girl touching a girl without consent but it does happen don’t let anyone tell you it doesn’t.,,
"I have had multiple classmates asking to have sex with them, as well as asking for nudes. When I refuse they constantly harass, bully, and call me terrible names. The schools students iare also incredibly racists and homophobic.",,
"There were so many occasions in the lower years (Year 7, 8 especially) where we were made to stand on desks so that the lengths of our skirts could be measured. Nothing was done to stop the guys watching us the whole time and trying (often succeeding) to look up our skirts and although I brushed it off at the time thinking about it now it seemed worth mentioning, if not as serious as other stories.",,
one day a kid pulled me it to the boys school bathroom in year 5 and raped me and then I told the school and they did nothing about it im know 20 and still cant do it with my partner because i am so traumatized,,
"When I was 15 he invited me over, we began kissing which I was okay with, but when he asked me to give him head I said no and that I had to get going as my parents were expecting me home. We were on his sofa, he sat on top of me and forced his penis into my mouth. he kept going until he came in my mouth, and then finally got off from on top of me and I ran to the sink and almost threw up. I was in denial that anything wrong had happened, I told myself I wanted to give him head and that I was fine with it, which wasn’t true. I agreed to see him again a few days later and the exact same thing happened. And then a few months later her tried to rape me, luckily I was strong enough to stop him, but he has done it to so many girls that I know of, and when I made a statement to the police they told me without evidence of a confession it wasn’t with opening a case.",,
"When I was 15 I was dating a 17 year old boy who had lied and told me he was 16. I knew he was in the year above me at school but thought he was young in his year. Not only did he put his hands on me in ways I wasn’t comfortable ( I wasn’t wearing tights and was wearing a low back top the second time we ever met. He put his hands on my thigh and lower back, I moved to get his hands off me and then he put them back and made me feel as though I should like that and it was harmless flirting) he also sent me a topless picture and asked me to send a photo in my underwear in return. We had been talking for a while and i has friends who knew him and so I trusted him, probably too much. I sent him a photo of me in my underwear, without my face in, and he complimented me and encouraged me to send more. In total I sent three similar photos, each time after he sent me a topless photo and said he deserves something in return. After we broke up he proceeded to share those photos around his year group at school and although my face wasn’t in them, everyone knew we had been dating and so could be fairly sure it was me. Not only was this really humiliating because I was an insecure teenager whose trust had been broken, but these were men over the age of 16 who were sharing images of me, a 15 year old girl. A boy who had been sent these photos let me know that this was happening and sent me screenshots of a group chat where my picture had been shared, where the boys were calling me a slut and picking apart my body. This not only shattered my ability to trust people but also really impacted my self confidence. I wish more schools taught boys that sexual misconduct includes ‘revenge porn’ not just men assaulting women physically in the street. Of all the terrible experiences I have had with sexual assault and harassment, this is the experience that most greatly impacted me and my future relationships and experiences",,
me and a group all touched by the same boy claiming it was cos he was drunk,,
"""Between the ages of 13-14 a ‘friend’ used to regularly send me sexually explicit messages and make sexual comments towards me, grope me, one time even forced me to watch porn with him. When we were 14 he shoved me onto the floor and sat on my chest whilst trying to undo his zipper on his trousers. When I pushed him off (I was screaming at this point and asking him to stop), he tried to undo my skirt and take off my tights to finger me but I kicked him away. I told my parents who told his parents and he texted me once saying he thought it was a bit of fun and said he had no idea I was upset, even though I was yelling stop and cried the whole time.,""I went to a party at the age of 14 where my guy best friend at the time kept telling me to drink more. I ended up so drunk I could barely walk from the table to the couch. While passed out, my supposed friend took advantage of me while he was almost fully sober. The next day everyone was congratulating me as if I had just won some prize. The girls all called me whores and made slut jokes. It’s been 3 years and I still hear the same comments. That day made me think so little of myself, to the point where I went around acting like a whore to validate people’s thoughts about me. I feel so disgusted with myself and I hate it so much.",,
"A couple years ago my school had a languages teacher come in, he seemed nice at first. Super friendly - the “cool young teacher” but things turned badly quite soon, he started drawing hearts in girls schoolbooks and he would say to one girl she looked good in her dress. The school acted terribly about the multiple incidents, it was kept quiet by the head teacher and he wasn’t reported to higher ups, meaning that he just moved on to another school putting more student in danger. What’s worse is one teacher was trying to blame the girls in the class, calling them attention seekers.",,
"I was at the school in the 90's and the PE teacher who was a woman, we went to swimming class outside of the school as they did not have a pool. and i was getting changed in one of the individual changing rooms, but the woman teacher was walking passed and was looking at us all getting dressed she looked in at me changing and my skirt was not on. I found out years later she was gay. Anyone of any sexual orientation should not be watchin anyone get dressed . The changing cubical had those small swing doors so you could see everyones legs but she was tall and looked over them and she commented on me being fast at dressing and announced in a big voice that I was almost dressed as shirt and tie were on. I feel freaked out now when I think about it. no one should be looking over at you getting dressed at all.",,
"When i was 15 and had sex for the first time with this guy in the year above. I was inexperienced so trusted him to treat me well. before we had sex he told me to close my eyes so i did what he said. little did i know he was taking pictures of me in explicit positions and when i said confronted him, he told me they were for his eyes only for later when i wasn’t there. i said i wasn’t comfortable with them and he said be quiet and perused to continue. we had sex then but half way through i said stop it hurts too much and he mocked me and i said no i’m not joking stop right now and he pushed me forward and continued. i said i needed the bathroom after but in reality i locked myself in there and cried for 15 mins shaking, feeling taken advantage of. it wasn’t until months later when i realised how wrong this situation was but i still felt worthless and vulnerable.",,
"I was at a party with people who only went to my school, meaning I thought I was safe. I was not. It was a dress up party and I was wearing something that many people would call ‘slutty’ causing some people to think I was asking for it. I was not. I was alone in a room to just take a breather, when a guy, who I thought was my friend, came in and started groping me. I kept saying no but for some reason that wasn’t enough for them to stop? Their hands kept travelling around my body and into my pants and they were clearly enjoying it. I was not. I got so scared that more would happen, I had to pretend to faint for them to stop. However, if one of my other friends hadn’t walked in at that moment I doubt me fainting would have stopped this guy from touching me. It was a long time before I told anyone about this and some people ‘felt sorry for me’ but some said ‘it wasn’t actually rape so it’s not a big deal.’ ITS A BIG DEAL!! I get scared whenever I go to parties or I am alone with a guy, even if I think they’re my ‘friend.’ Even if it’s ‘not a big deal’ to some people, it has scarred me and I hate that I’ve been made to feel bad about speaking out about what’s happened to me. I’m glad I’ve had this opportunity to speak about this and I hope other people feel comfortable enough to do so too!",,
"When I was in year 9 or 10, the boys in my year decided to make a list of all the girls they thought were hot and this was obviously quite demeaning for all the girls who weren’t on this list. The thing that upset me the most about this situation was that when I asked my friends (girls) about the list they avoided the topic which just suggested to me that I wasnt on the list and also that they were all on the list and the only reason they didnt make an issue out of it was because they were all on it. This took a massive toll on my mental health at the time and continues to affect me, and I ask myself all the time why no one felt like they could stand up to the boys that were objectifying us",,
Nothing i could say. It was traumatizing.,,
"When I was 16 I made the decision to send the boy I really liked nudes. It was my choice and I came to really regret my decision. I thought I could trust him with them but like so many other peoples stories, he screenshotted them and sent them on his boys groupchat. I didn’t know any of his friends personally but they were all dating girls in the year above me at school, so pretty soon after that a majority of boys from his school and girls at mine had seen the pictures. I remember being terrified my parents would find out and I just sat in all my lessons for weeks petrified that the head of year would come in and ask to speak to me. Thankfully the whole thing blew over after a couple of weeks but the trauma and anxiety all of it caused has stayed with me to this day.",,
"He would grab my ass in choir. I was only 15. He would follow me home, he would whisper in my ear in class and tell me that if i ever told anyone, he’d do it again. he got what he wanted the night of my freshman homecoming. i never went to a dance again. the school did nothing, the law did nothing. i am alone.",,
"""I was groped in a public space by someone else in my year. he was my best friend. ,I reported him to my school, where i was told i would receive justice and his parents would be contacted as i had evidence of his confession. all it took was for him to say ‘i didn’t do anything’, and the school immediately turned on me. i was ignored and humiliated by my own school. their own pastoral services. since then, i have faced rude comments from him and a loss of my friends, thinking i lied because he told them i did, as well as the school telling me to ‘get over it’ when i told them this was happening.""",,
"When I was in year 8, I liked this boy. He was really nice to me and I enjoyed talking to him. This was until he acted strange. Pointing out how I looked “topless” in my profile picture. I explained I wasn’t and he said “aww”. Another time was when he admitted i had a nice “shape”. Sayibg he’s stared at me before.",,
"I'm 50 now, when I was about 8 asleep in bed, I woke up and my great grandad hand was between my legs, it has really impacted my life.",,
"Boys at [school names omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] have constantly asked me friends and I for nudes, and some have sent them as the boys have repetitively asked for sustained periods of time until the girls give in to stop harassment, and boys think that this is therefore consent",,
I was forced to send nudes. My bf told me he would break up with me if I didn’t.,,
"I always hear boys in my class rate girls boobs and ass and say they would love to put their faces in inappropriate place, however when I try and tell them to stop they just tell me to shut up f*g.",,
in my school a boy in my class told all his friends about sexual dreams that he had. about me i was then told he had looked up my skirt multiple times the school found out and tried to get me in trouble for it and put me in isolation he admitted that he done it to me coz he said ‘sorry i shouldn’t of done it’ but the teachers. still told me that he was a ‘nice boy’ and he wouldn’t do that and they told me about how upset he was and made me feel like it was all my problem nothing was ever done about it and i had to stay in the same class as him for the rest of the year,,
"A few months ago I got very drunk, I passed out and someone I know, who I thought was a really nice person, assaulted me. Till this day I still don’t know exactly what happened, and I don’t think I ever will. He has claimed he was really drunk so he doesn’t remember a thing. He then tried to get in bed with my friend soon after, luckily she was sober and able to get him away. When I told figures of authority, I was repeatedly asked why I was so drunk, and what was I wearing. As a result, I have lost a lot of self confidence, and I have so much anxiety. However I have had the most amazing love and support from my friends, and I could not be more grateful for them. If you have suffered, PLEASE reach out.",,
"I was assaulted as I walked up the stairs to a chemistry lesson and when it was reported, I was told boys will be boys. There was multiple occasions boys were getting caught taking photos up girls skirts and we were just told to wear shorts underneath or trousers instead as they couldn’t help that we were desirable. I had multiple occasions where boys younger and older than me would repeatedly shout profanities about my breasts and bum at me.",,
"i understand this isn’t as serious as incidents that other people have experienced, however it has made me feel highly uncomfortable ever since it happened. i was talking to a guy from kcs over snapchat and from the get go the only thing he would talk about was sex and all the ways he would want to fuck me. he repeatedly made comments about my body and made me feel quite uncomfortable. he was 16 and older than me and as i had no attention from guys before i didnt say anything about how uncomfortable i felt at the time. he asked me a lot for nudes but i never sent them. i never met up with him but he would often say what he would want to do when we met up involving me giving him head. every single conversation i had with him he found a way to turn it sexual. this carried on for a short while until i finally told him i didn’t want to talk to him and blocked him on all social media. i think he thought i should take it as a compliment that he wanted to fuck me and he would describe in detail how he would do it",,
I was raped multiple times during a relationship with my (older) boyfriend who once posted nude photos of me (a minor) in order for me to stop ignoring his texts/calls. This small statement however does not express the full extent of his actions,,
"I was being swarmed by a group of boys sexually harassing me And the pastoral managers only said that if I was to agree to them getting punished I would have to be punished aswell . Up until a day ago the harassment had stopped . And now whenever I’m interviewing for something like a role familiar to you ‘Headgirl’ what happened is always brought up as if I should’ve sacrificed my dignity and just stood attempting to un-avoid the situation and be quite about it , till this day nothing has been done about it",,
"We were by the coast for dinner in a group. It was a warm evening. Afterwards he said let’s go by see the sea. I walked in the dark at the beach. He grabbed me from behind - I froze, I was scared I could die as he had control . I was swollen and in pain for days. I didn’t go to the police. I could find a pharmacy there and drank whisky to stop feeling the pain. I still remember that night very often. I’m single and scared. He was tall, very good looking and rich. I hope he doesn’t do it again to anyone else.",,
"a girl im friends with whos in year 7-8 got touched inappropriately on the thighs by some boy whos homophobic towards her and he claims shes ""his gf"" and when i tried to talk to him he said well shes my gf so its fine and when i told him that doesnt mean u dont need consent he just ignored me 😐, our school didnt really do anything about this even tho we reported it to teachers",,
"My whole life I've always been on the chubbier side, however, when I was in year 10, I developed an eating disorder and lost a lot of weight. We wore uniforms and my blazer was quite big on me and so no one really saw my body. One day, it was a non-uniform day and I was wearing a black long sleeved body suit and black jeans. Whenever I'd walk into a class room or around the room to get something, the popular boys (who I rarely spoke to) would not stop staring and whispering to each other. The next lesson my class were in a computer room and the boys sat a few seats away from me and were taking to each other about girls they've had sex with and got nudes from, one of the boys leant back and called for my attention and when I turned around, he said ""you're next"", I turned back around ingorning them and like 5 mins later, one of the other boys called me again and said that the orgininal boy wanted to tell me something and he was quickly hushed by the other kid. Ever since that day, I have been even more self conscious of my body and all I wear is oversized shirts and baggy trousers, no ones seen my body in the last 2 years. That day I went from invisible to everyone noticing me.",,
"I went for a year in Y7. At a birthday party I gw someone topless in front of everyone. It was awful and I’m still ashamed of it. People took pictures, which I was told I should’ve been happy about because I had a ‘good body’ . I was 11 years old. I also remember 3 boys would take turns groping me at break and one of them fingered me at one point. I hated it but I was made to feel like it was a compliment. That school was a race to develop as fast as possible and I’m glad left when I did",,
I was walking with a close friend of mine and we were both holding hands (because I nearly fell and she didn’t want me to fall) I feel like it might be worth noting that we are both females. We were leaving our final class of the day to go home and laughing and joking and some guys way older than us in the school standing under some stairs asked us if we were going to have sex and if they could join or even just watch. I don’t think I have felt so uncomfortable and I didn’t know what to do so we just sort of ran off.,,
"My first sexual relationship was with a boy in my year when I was 16, it started off consensual but after the first few weeks there was no discussion of what I wanted. It got increasingly violent and I regularly felt violated and pressured. I would regularly express that I was physically in pain and didn't like that but was told that's just how it is and to keep going. At a certain point I started dissociating around anything sexual and my passivity was assumed as consent. At the time I thought that's just how sex is for everyone and I think so did he. Now age 24 I still struggle with having panic attacks and dissociating during sex and generally.,When I was 18 I went to my first nightclub, someone reached under my shirt and held my bare breast for a second. I didn't see who. I've lost count of the times I've been groped in clubs since.",,
"In primary school, there was this boy that I thought was my friend. He slapped my bum, without my permission but he did it multiple times. I told him stop but he didn’t. He then attacked me. He pushed me over and stamped on my back. He still continued to slap my bum and do inappropriate things.",,
"I was a uni student. I went out for a few drinks with my housemate and we bumped into a group of 4 lads we knew quite well. Neither of us had ever had any form of sexual experience in the months we had known them. They came back to our house which wasn't unusual to watch movies and have a drink. Only this time one of the group came on to my housemate who had fancied him since we knew them. They went into the kitchen. Next thing I remember I woke up on the sofa my knickers cut off with a knife, the tampon I was using removed. I screamed, police were called. Blood tests showed I had been drugged. I still to this day do not know what they did to me.",,
I was recently sexually assaulted by a male at my school and nothing whatsoever was done about it,,
one of my best friends pinned me in a locker room i couldn’t move.,,
"In our school common room, full of people at break time, I overhead two boys discussing what size thong they thought I wore and how tight it would be for them to snap. I called them out and was clearly uncomfortable, but didn’t want to make huge fuss with so many people around. They laughed it off as a joke. I eventually started dating one of them but our first time sleeping together wasn’t really consensual and I felt so uncomfortable around him that I ended things.",,
"I have two stories. One with an older guy and one with a girl. I was on Grindr looking for a hookup in my first year of uni. There was this 45 year old guy, he was attractive and I agreed to meet him, but insisted he used a condom. I had my back to him when we started and didn't realise until he was done that he had removed the condom, I had to get PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) and was sick because of the results. The second time I was with a girl I had met at the club, we went back to mine and started having sex, midway through she started to choke me, she was a rugby player so had some strength, I said no and she continued until I physically pulled her hand off, she then called me a ""pussy"" and teased me a bout the size of my penis, something I became so insecure about I had to look up after, finding out it was average. I was shaken up as these situations took place within the same three months, I was only able to resume sexual contact with people after seeing a therapist and a year and a half gap.",,
I was drunk at a party and was on the arm of a chair and this boy started feeling up my thigh and I was very uncomfortable and was giving the people around me the help me eyes and he started kissing me and I cried after,,
"I had become friends with this guy I sat next to (Note: both of us r males). We sat next to each other in the classroom and we trusted each other. One day, I sat next to him and he started touching me inappropriately. I felt uncomfortable and I couldn’t do anything either. I felt hopeless. Then, after school, I contacted him and confronted him about it. He just told me he was trying to get my attention. I knew it was a lie, but I decided not to say anything more on the matter. This went on for just less than a week. I had a mental breakdown infront of my sister and mother and I told them everything. They comforted me and then they brought me to school the next day and they informed the school. The only action that was taken was that the guys social worker was told and I was moved classes. The guy was never punished for his actions.",,
When I was 15 a boy I was seeing a boy in the year above me - I was extremely innocent at the time and had had no sexual encounters before so was uncomfortable with having sex. He got me really drunk and performed sexual acts on me and completely took advantage of me. He was then so pressurising to me to sleep with him and would gas light me and make me feel guilty to the point I had an anxiety attack. I told my friends about it and somehow rumours about what happened went round my school and certain boys in my school teased me about it and found it funny.,,
"From ages 8-16 I was touched by my step dad. I’m currently still 16 it ended in March. But my mom don’t really believe me. He still lives with me and I am supposed to still respect him. My grandmas knows and as soon as I get a car I’m supposed to be moving out. I tired to say something when I was 9 but no one believed me. I think he did/continue to do it to my sister(she’s 12) and it is still going but she won’t say anything to my mom. My mom also told me not to tell anyone because I would ruin his life. I told her I wanted to see a therapist but she didn’t think I need it. I’ve thought about committing suicide even went so far as starting cutting(I have stopped cutting).Then I cried for weeks on end, and I didn’t eat, and my grades started dropping. I got yelled at because I have nothing else to worry about. I just want to get out of here.",,
A boy at my school during an art lesson started moving his chair towards me I was sitting at the corner of the room so i couldn't move over i asked him to move over so i could have more space but he kept moving close after that he slipped his hand under the desk and brushed it along my thigh then returned his hand to my upper thigh and moved his hand up to my vaginal area i was so shocked I didn't know what to do i just got up and went to get some pens I didn't tell anyone for a week because i felt ashamed eventually i told my friend who told me to tell the school I did and they did NOTHING.,,
I was physically and verbally sexually assaulted. I was peer pressured for things I didn’t want to do. He kissed me without my consent. I was asked if things that no one (boy or girl) should be asked. I was touched in places that no one should be (A reminder; I am only 13. I’m not even in high school yet. This is how bad the world is.)I was blamed for things they did. They searched my phone (after we got help) even though I had done NOTHING. I said NO to everything. No means no. They did not charge him and my school/ police did nothing about it.,,
"I was only 14 at that time and inexperienced with relationships. My boyfriend at that time was walking me back home and all of a sudden he wanted me to kiss him. I tried to push myself away from him and kept trying to tell him no I felt too awkward as we were in the middle of the street. However instead of listening to me, he grabbed my arms and wouldn't let go and it started to hurt. He kept pulling me closer to him so he can wrap his arms around my waist and forced his lips on me.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by a boy in my year at school. I told him I didn’t want to have sex because I was a virgin, he put his dick in me anyways until I yelled at him to get off me. Had to go to school and see him every day for a year. Ruined my a level grades. Things do get better but this will stay with me for the rest of my life.",,
I was about 13 and a guy who I’d known for years and considered an extremely close friend almost like family introduced me to a guy he thought I’d like. We started talking and after about a day he asked me for intimate pictures which I didn’t want to send at all. My close guy friend found out about this and started calling me frigid and it got to the point where I did not want to deal with it at all anymore and so I jus sent the pictures. A few days later the pictures were everywhere and people I didn’t even know were laughing at me and texting me I’ve never felt so ugly and embarrassed. After that I struggled with intimacy and hated the way I looked and I know I didn’t deserve it but it really stuck with me and I’m now in a good relationship but I still did not feel comfortable with my body as I feared the same thing would happen again even after months of dating. I didn’t wanna explain that to my boyfriend but eventually he helped me feel comfortable again but the fear is always going to be there and I hate that some guy was able to effect my perception of myself so much at such a young age.,,
"there was this guy going around my school saying he was a sophomore when in reality he was about to graduate. but that’s not the point. the point is , is that he had added me on instagram and he was automatically asking very personal questions that made me very uncomfortable so then i blocked him and didn’t use my phone for the rest of the night. the next day, i go into school and i see a tall man about 6’3 just staring at me when i walk in and we make eye contact and i just tun right passed him and he keeps following me and calling my name like if he knew me. so then i run to the girls bathroom and he starts saying that he will get me. later on that day i find out that he had raped several girls a manipulated many of them from my school. even after all the proof we showed our ap and main principle, they never did anything to keep us safe",,
"i was at a party with my friends and one of the boys kissed me out of nowhere. he kept trying and i didn’t want it. he kept getting angry saying i was leading him on because i wouldn’t kiss him back. he kept wanting to talk about what we were when nothing happened between us before so he took me into the bathroom alone and continued to kiss me. i was too drunk to really realise or stop anything. i fell over at one point and was on the ground. him and his friend took my top off whilst i was on the floor. they then began licking my chest area. later on in the evening i had no way of getting home so he walked me. he continuously groped me and kissed me though i was making it clear i didn’t want it even though i was confused and disorientated. at the time i did not think it was bad, and the manipulation that occurred caused me to believe i had played a part, which i didn’t realise until later. he then became angry because he got back with his girlfriend and did not want her to find out, therefore began to threaten me to ensure nothing would be found out. i lost friends due to the way they reacted, even justifying his actions as it wasn’t done to them and found everything funny. once it got out, it was used as a way for them to brag, even twisting the events to make me seem worse. and i was then slut-shamed for everything that happened.",,
"I used to get mocked for not changing with the rest of my peers during PE. Got my bag emptied, had people hide my clothes in the changing rooms to force me to go collect them. Had accusations i had been sexually assaulted. Even got cornered once I went to get my stuff and some group tried to go for me. same teachers that knew what was going on forced me to change in front of everyone and told me to man up. Little did they know that whole time i was actually getting sexually assaulted at home and that i never got changed in front of people because there were physical scarring as well as mental scarring that i didn't understand enough to want to show to the world yet. i’ve always had my guard up since.",,
"I was passed round a group of guys and raped when i was 15. When I tried to tell people what happened, the guys used the fact I have autism to say it’s my fault and that my autism means I don’t have to give consent as I will never understand. Teachers said if it wasn’t for my autism I would have seen the red flags sooner before it was too late. Even if I realised later that doesn’t mean men are allowed to rape me. People with learning disabilities are people too. It seems like everyone will come up with any excuse to blame the girl but never the guy.",,
"last week of school i was with my “friends” 3 boys and 1 girl, we were running through the halls playing hid and seek after school trying to not get caught by aps i was with this boy who i didn’t know very well and when we’d stop and that a breath, he would push himself up against me, or grab my butt i tried to tell him to stop but he kept doing it, so then i went back and he wouldn’t give me back my crocs he was like “you can have it back if you get on your knees and..”",,
he took advantage of me. i trusted him and he raped me.,,
"A boy had sex with me in a bath tub whilst I was extremely drunk, and could be considered paralytic. I have felt extremely closed off since, and have been really put off sexual relations.",,
"There is such a toxic environment at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with the majority of boys just looking at girls as people they can link or sleep with. My experience wasn’t as bad as others so I consider myself lucky. I was very drunk at a friends house of around 20 people max and this boy who I wasn’t close with kept following me around. He’d keep trying to corner me and isolate me from the group. I thought he was being friendly so we did end up having a conversation but he started to touch my leg and stuff. I was very drunk but not drunk enough to be completely unaware so I went back to the group and asked one of our mutual friends to keep him away from me. I’m so thankful that there was someone I trusted to help me there and I always look back and wonder what could have happened if I was more drunk. That same boy had done the exact same thing to many other people, most a lot worse than what I experienced.",,
"In 2016, I was at a house party at the weekend and I had my drink spiked and was then was then sexually assaulted by someone whilst his friends watched and filmed the assault. I did not consent to any of this. This video that was taken was then used to “blackmail” me into other sexual acts. After a few weeks, I told a male teacher about it school as I wanted it to stop and the teachers response was that this was just what boys did and everyone does this, everyone films each other having sex. After this response I was left feeling it was my fault and did not go on to report it.",,
"Hi there, I am currently 22 years old, studying, and nearly the last decade I have been plagued by a terrible trauma, I was raped on [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], this occured when I was at [school name ommitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I was in year 9 and I was getting changed back into my school uniform after P.E. and I was having a casual conversation with 4 boys, 3 of those boys shortly after left the changing room and the boy who remained who was only 7 months older than me rapidly grabbed my neck as I was facing the wall and pushed my head to the wall and said 'if you scream I will break your skull on this marble tile"" he then forceabley inserted his penis into my anas, I felt violated on another level and couldn't comprehend what was occuring in that moment, I froze and staring at my phone which was tossed across the floor, the whole incident lasted around 8 minutes, less time then taking a shower or eating a meal but unfortunately it has plagued my development and trust of new things, I contacted the police and they conducted a thorough investigation, however, after no evidence due to myself reporting 8 years on because of initial shame and denial they closed the case. I am Ok most days but my life would be a lot less complex and tiring if this moment had never become a moment. I feel there are others at my school similar to my age group that could have experienced the same level of trauma, however, we may never know, but i just thought i would try to ignite something. Thank u stay safe",,
in my year eight friendship group there was one boy that told all of our friends that he had a crush on me. he never asked me out instead he repeatedly touched me and grabbed my boobs. when i went to the school i was told that it was “just boys being boys” and that there was nothing they could do.,,
When I was in 8th grade a kid came up to me and grabbed my ass. Everyone that saw it happen just laughed it off. I was afraid to go back to school for weeks.,,
This boy at school always has sexually harassed me and my friends at school and the school did nothing.,,
"I was routinely followed and harassed by a senior at my school after rejecting him. We sat by each other and he'd often draw inappropriate things just to show them to me, even getting his friends involved. He'd try to put his hand on my thigh, even after I'd tell him to stop. I barely knew anyone, and it only made me feel more alone. I almost dropped the class altogether because the thought of going made me want to puke.",,
"I was only in Year 5 when young boys would harass me at school. When I was 10, I didn't really look my age. I looked older. Like 12 or 13. What I mean is like my breasts and butt were bigger than everyone else's and I was quite tall. This person in my class that everyone loved would harass me and it started in Year 4. I was a quiet kid and I didn't have the confidence to tell anyone that I trusted. Every single day, he would touch me in places that I didn't want him to touch without my permission. And he would stare at me in class. When I told the teacher, they thought that it's just because of my body. But they shouldn't touch me just because of my body. That's not a valid reason to touch someone.",,
"A guy told me to come hang out with him and his friends. I was down for it because it sounded like a big group so therefore safe. I went over and pretty fast all his friends left the room leaving just us. I was confused but it happened so fast and I was caught off guard. The guy shoved his hands in my pants and I suddenly realised I had been lured and trapped. We had sex and I hated every second of it. I didn’t have a way out. Turns out he was a virgin too. The whole group must have been in on it. All big people in fashion, music and social media now...",,
When I was little my cousin used to touch me and ask me where I wanted to be kissed and I didn’t know it was wrong until I was older.,,
"i was walking in the corridor alone on a normal school day and two boys behind me were whispering “look at her ass look at her ass” and when i turned around they said “beautiful ass darling” among other things and were catcalling me and i turned back around not knowing what to do and then they started calling me bitch, slut, whore etc. i was wearing my uniform. my skirt was a normal length.",,
"I was in the lunch queue at school. It gets very busy in this queue and everyone pushes into each other so of course you end up accidentally touching people. However I was in the queue once by myself and the popular group of boys were behind me. Already I was uncomfortable about this as I was a shy girl that wasn’t really friends with them. I then start feeling someone grabbing my ass. At first I just thought it was an accident because the queue was very busy however this person then continued to grab it and I didn’t know what to do because I couldn’t move. I was very uncomfortable and afterwards I balled my eyes out. I felt violated and, baring in mind I was only in yr 9, I didn’t know what to do about it so I just left it. After this incident I was terrified about going in the lunch queue again and so ended up not eating lunch at school for a while.",,
"When I was 14 a boy 2 years older than me groomed me & pressured me to send photos of me to him. He was really aggressive & manipulative as he said it was normal for people to do these days. He would threaten me if I wouldn’t send and when I considered reporting him to my school (which he temporarily worked at) he said that I would be in as much trouble as him bc I sent photos and that I’d ruin his family even more as his mum had recently passed away so obviously I didn’t dream of reporting him then. He was also my first experience with a boy so I didn’t question much of his behaviour at all. He was the brother of a boy in my year & despite convincing me not to tell anyone about what he was doing he’d constantly threaten to tell his brother about what I was sending & that him & his mates (considered “popular” at my old school) would “destroy” me. Once people started to found i was harassed about it (people would yell his name really loudly around me to get a reaction)…,…and boys took it as an invite to get more photos from me. I really related to Zara’s documentary because she said she wanted to be “liked” by the “popular” people & mistakenly thought sending those photos would make that happen as did I. When rumours started circulating about this I was constantly harassed on a daily basis throughout my final 2 years at secondary school as I was called a “slut/slag/whore” by girls & boys. I’d have boys constantly harass & pressure me for nudes. I really wanted to move schools for year 11 but because of gcses that wasn’t possible. I went to a different sixth form & i thought I was finally free but then I would see people from my new school with people from my old school which gave me so much anxiety. I remember a friend of mine was at a party & a girl from my old school spoke to her & said “are you friends with [my name]” “she’s such a slag/slut”. Even my boyfriend at the time told me that his friends from a different school told him that I’ve been ”passed around” and that he should “be careful”. This meant that rumours about me had spread across 3 different secondary schools in my local area. I struggled for years with immense anxiety & have been in & out of therapy for 3 years now. This will be the first time to have spoken out publicly about it but I have wanted to for years now."",“I literally never thought anything was wrong about this and just brushed it off as ‘he was horny and drunk’ but like a guy I’d been seeing for a month who KNEW I wasn’t on birth control took advantage of how distracted i was and just went from eating me out to putting his bare cock inside me and then coercing me into letting him do it again later. He also got his phone out to film me without asking on multiple occasions, and I was too young and naïve to say no??? Like that same guy showed me a vid he sent his friends of him fucking his ex??? So the whole friend group has probs all seen the videos he took”,“Uggghhhhhhhh why is this shit so common. My ex who was manipulative and has left me with a lot of trauma filmed me during sex without my consent, I literally had no idea until he was scrolling thru his pictures and a video of him fucking me from behind came up. He also kept my nudes for years after we broke up even though I begged him to delete them, he sent them to my friends as well to get back at me. Years later I’m still hurting from all of this.”,“I’ve told my boyfriend and one of my female friends about the time I was raped and the initial reaction is always. But did you say no? Did you fight it? Did you kiss before? Did you find him attractive? Was it really rape though? - for context, he drugged me, I was 17, he was 25. The most common response is why don’t you just go to the police? Or why didn’t I? It’s so insensitive And people make me feel like my story is not credible or I’m exaggerating because ‘if it had actually happened’ I would’ve gone to the police“,“Rape culture is so toxic and terrifying as a female. Being asian I’ve often felt fetishised and overly sexualised yet boys normalise it and joked about it around me as if I was supposed to just take it and accept. Literally getting told from boys in my class I ‘remind them of the asian girls in porno’ and compared to hentai anime girls. This overt sexualisation of woman combined with a lack of accountability is why rape Culture thrives and I fucking hate it.”,“The grey area is the worst because guys genuinely don’t realise. Also the comments of ‘oh he’s a nice guy apart from girls’ like it’s taken as such a casual thing even though no one should have to deal with it and the guys should be held accountable. I’ve read every story they’ve posted and honestly they’ve helped me realise that some situations I’ve been in weren’t me overreacting but were just wrong. I was getting with a guy and a bunch of us stayed over at his. He spent the whole night being like oh if you’re not gonna sleep with me at least give me head because you’re giving me huge blue balls - I didn’t but I remember feeling genuinely guilty and bad about it. It’s only now I realise how fucked the whole situation was”,“A really shit thing about dealing with sexual assault as a teen is that it sometimes inadvertently becomes the norm of your understanding of what sexual experiences are. Particularly if a girl speaks up about it, a lot of times we are dismissed and unless you create that confidence for yourself around how ‘sure you are that it happened’ (which is really tough and not something a survivor of any sexual violence should have to need to be believed). I was told so many times by the guy that it was a mistake and we were both drunk that it makes you question if it ever happened at all. that made me so confused about consent and how shit is supposed to look like if that makes sense … along that line as well, if you’re made to believe that nothing wrong was done but you carry around these awful feelings that you know are tied to those events, it’s painful as shit.”,“Honestly it’s so awful, especially how normalized it was at the time. Also how any girl who exploring her sexuality was labeled a ‘whore’ and yet those boys were allowed to gt away with the most disgusting behaviour and language every day and how deep that goes. Even as a girl I’m guilty of not challenging that narrative at the time and probably even to a degree pervading that in my own language. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. So horrendous. I know of so many people who were either made to feel humiliated and shamed by a lot of boys at that age, particularly that group, or even harassed by them. Worst part is they have zero remorse and will probably never show any accountability. So horrible to digest. And particularly when you’ve been through a trauma as such to those. Means, and then see other girls having gone through similar or even more heinous stuff. It’s like a whole other level of empathy that re ignites your trauma”,“That was two years ago and I still can’t trust men. A month ago he reposted one of my stories for BLM movement, and my anger at his complete indifference to what he had done to me came to a boiling point. I sent him links to sexual consent websites and told him to educate himself on this topic as well, and explained that his actions had a big effect on me, to which he replied ‘what you think happened between us call it drunk summer life’. I blocked him and a day later he had deleted all the messages.”,“Having heard horribly stories like this from friends for years I used to count myself as one of the lucky ones who hadn’t really experienced more than misogynistic conversations from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys and being groped on a night out. But like having read this brought up some things I’ve tried to forget or brush off. Honestly the worst guys I’ve come across have all been [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys it’s like the entire culture was that women are worth less and are just there for pleasure and don’t have their own feelings or deserve respect. There’s been so many times I’ve been present for conversations where boys were so vile about girls, and there’s only so many times u can call them out before it’s directed at you.”,“It’s been so difficult during this time reflecting on my past and how many situations i’ve been in that have been rape and sexual assault. i have a medical issue which causes my cervix to hurt at time and in my past relationship, my boyfriend knew about this and one time I was crying to stop having sex because it hurt and he was saying how he can change position or he’s nearly done or whatever and kept going and i was still crying and had to just take it in silence. i didn’t even realise it was rape until nearly a year and half later because people don’t discuss rape in relationships or positions of trust enough. same with being pressured into having sex - i feel like a lot of men know their way around no’s especially with girls who they deem to be less confident and less likely to speak out. one time late last year a boy was trying to pressure me to sleep with him after i changed my mind and started saying i have a fucked up mentality and that it’s unfair (??) and kept insulting me for not wanting to do it. instances like that have happened so often that i don’t think anything of them half the time but the anger that comes from some men when someone doesn’t want to have sex with them is really disgusting because there’s a created idea that they are obliged to women’s bodies and don’t understand consent.”, “Feel like everyone has an experience of boys like this and I went back and actually have screenshots of texts where the rape culture and my internalised misogyny is insanely obvious. First time I got really drunk ended up in a room with a boy and it all got a bit much and he left to get a condom and I ran away and then the next day I was essentially gaslit into thinking it didn’t happen because he had a girlfriend and I had been too drunk - these are the texts and the ‘really sorry’ from me and the ‘aha’ just show that we didn’t even realise how what we thought was ‘normal’ was completely warped”,“I was with this older guy hanging out and I had to go home for dinner with my family. He said this is your dinner and gave me a pill then barricaded the door with the furniture in his room so I couldn’t get out. I started freaking out because I couldn’t leave and started to worry so I kinda jokingly was removing the furniture and playing into him saying stuff like haha you’ll get some soon or whatever while he’s holding onto my ankles. Also his mother was on her desktop literally on the other side of the wall and probably heard all of the commotion and did not step in. Anyways I manoeuvred my way out. I don’t know what he gave me but the journey home was certainly interesting. I’ve had guys do similar fucked up things like take a family heirloom ring off of my finger and put it on theirs and refuse to give it back because they didn’t want me to leave. I’ve had guys lie to me and say they were locked out of the house or missed the last train back so they could play to my generosity and stay at mine. One time that happened I literally made a bed for him in a different room and he creepy into my room in the night, and kept pressuring me to have sex with him, I eventually gave in and took it because saying no over and over again wasn’t working and I wanted it to be over and done with.”,“These are insane. I buried so many experiences like these and it’s just wild hearing all of these women’s stories. At the time it all feels normal(ish) or you’re so young that you don’t quite understand the lines these boys are blatantly crossing and how they’re all blown up and no one cares. Men need to hold each other accountable more. Seen so many abusers posting ‘dm me if I’m following your abuser’ and it’s like seriously?! Do they not remember like 50+ times where they either coerced women, forcibly raped them when they were fucked up alone on drugs, shared girls nudes publicly, took photos of them without consent, lied to women to get them to sleep with them, pulled off condoms, lied about age (this one really gets me) to sleep with an underage girl, the list goes on and on. Not to mention all of their friends are guilty of all that too. It really gets me and what’s so frustrating is that these things can come out yet it’s so normalised between men that there are no consequences”,“A bit later on holiday I was getting with a guy two years older than me for the second night in a row. We went outside for a cigarette and he offered me a joint which I took, but after one toke I could tell it wasn’t just weed and I started losing control of my body. He then stood up and started trying to shove his dick into my mouth while I pressed my lips together, crying, for about 2 minutes, after which he called me a “frigid slut” (???), shoved the joint into my mouth and forced me to breathe in while I was choking and crying. He started laying me on the ground and I guess adrenaline kicked in bc I kneed him in the balls, ran away and hid behind a van before my body collapsed. He was a big dog in the town we were in and worked in the bar everyone went to, and because I didn’t want to tell any adults, I had to see him behind the counter every day. He would wink and smirk at me like what had happened was funny.”,“That’s the thing, it’s so embedded in culture that unless they walk around with RAPIST on their forehead, everyone’s like « oh, X did that? Nahhh, he probably didn’t mean it in that way. Don’t worry » And it made me so so so angry to the point where it was easier to cry. Because you feel a complete loss of faith And it wasn’t until I opened up about my rape to my parents, who’ve also used the phrase ‘het up’ regarding how I’ve spoken about sexual misconduct and ‘lad culture’ And who have always been massive advocates for chastity and saving myself (indian parents lol). It wasn’t until I told my mum I was raped when I was 14. A CHILD. That I felt like all those years of anger, and being a ‘social justice warrior’ too lol, getting into arguments with family over girls ‘asking for it’ That I felt my opinion was valid and they took me seriously and it explained my sensibilities. But you don’t need to share your experience, and I don’t really unless I feel like that person is already on my level regarding sexual assault/harassment/rape. You don’t owe anyone anything. You can be angry and you SHOULD be fucking angry about any form of sexual misconduct”,“This one boy called [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] tried to have sex with me, but I kept saying no. He barricaded the door with his body forcing kisses on me and not letting me leave. He kept begging me to get into his bed while he was blocking me from leaving his room. I had to punch his hand to get out! These men are awful! They’re all evil. And they’re all friends with each other and support this behaviour”,“It makes me feel so uncomfortable to read [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] stories bc I know this boys club is all around me now. Idk if irony is the right word for it but I escaped it as a teenager and now I’m surrounded by it as a young professional. And I thought it was more the older guys but had drinks last week with a client who is roughly my age and listening to some of his stories confirmed that it is definitely in the younger generation as well. But what makes me feel the absolute worst is that if I speak out about work, I am automatically excluded from the conversations guys will have, bc I will be labelled a social justice warrior even though I think among our friends I wouldn’t consider myself ‘woke’. With a couple people I have talked about it and they are understand bc it’s never happened to them, it’s totally normalised and women are there to fulfil sexual needs and desires. Even now I’m going through [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] Stories again to find something to screenshot to my stories and I’m struggling to decide what to post, how to post this in a ‘palatable’ way bc I have clients and friends in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] that follow me.”,“Also by the way [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] has done that to me before he said he was locked out and was in the area, he came over to mine. I was studying and he said my tutor tells me there’s no point studying when you don’t want to. So I stopped and we talked and he kept asking me to lie down. After a while I think he noticed I wouldn’t give in so he miraculously became unlocked out and left. I found out at school the next day from a girl who was at the party a few blocks down where he was that he told and was making bets with everyone that he could sleep with me. So I guess his plan was to trick his way into my pants then go back to the party and receive the clout from everyone for winning the bet??”,“I’ve been speaking to a therapist about it for a while and it’s really opened my eyes up to experiences in my teenage years that were so inappropriate. As well as getting slut shamed for drunken violations towards you, it’s vile and I want boys in our generation to learn that it is completely and totally unacceptable to even touch a woman without permission. Even a bum slap that was unwarranted, it’s not remotely funny.”,“This is such an important issue which I honestly think most boys don’t even understand is a problem. I remember getting really angry at my brother ([school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] your year) when he told me that him and all his friends skipped the compulsory consent workshop his uni had put on because ‘none of us are rapists, we’re not the ones that it’s for’ when I think from your stories it’s pretty clear that even if they haven’t been involved with something like this then at the LEAST it’s happening all around them with people they know, that they need to learn to call out.”,“So important this boys club is called out in some degree. It’s horrifyingly common cause it’s a mentality we all were so absorbed in … still are. Especially as these [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys will probably go on to RUN OUR FUCKING COUNTRY. Makes me feel sick, the bubble of protection around them.”,“I am happy to discuss the experiences I’ve faced by boys who are in my social circle who I can’t avoid at times but I’m never comfortable disclosing their names. It’s a fucked up cycle. A lot of the boys I tell her horrified, little do they know it’s their best mate who did it to me”,""I entered the working world at 19 and was so unprepared on how to handle men making me uncomfortable in a professional environment. Soon after I was hired, a man who I’d be working closely with was hired. He was old enough to be my dad and on his first day asked my age, and followed it with “if I wasn’t married I’d take u out for a drink.” He on another occasion came into the break room where I was sitting on a chair with my feet up on another chair to which he said “u look really sexy like that.” There was also a woman who worked in the building who’s girlfriend would come and visit her for lunch. When they would kiss goodbye he’d stare at them and say “look they’re kissing”. This a grown man with a wife and child... he got fired soon after for being verbally aggressive to another female.,There was also another man I’d say 50/60 who waited until I was alone to approach me to again ask my age (which u don’t do unless someone looks as though they could be underage, and in your 50s/60s u shouldn’t be approaching girls where that’s a question u need to ask). Anyway he was flirting with me and asking me out and making me uncomfortable. Turns out he also bothered two other girls who had my job before me to the point where they filed complaints against him.,There was also a guy who would constantly ask me out. He asked if he could give me his number to contact him when a client arrived for him which is a common request. He then would message me all the time but because I’d see him at work didn’t feel I could block him or ignore him as it would be awkward when I’d see him so I would just bluntly reply. He was always trying to flirt with me and would be asking me out and I wasn’t interested at all which he wasn’t seeming to get. Thankfully for me he was fired shortly after and I blocked him. I then found out that not long before he started working where I worked he had been imprisoned for sexually assaulting a woman who was walking home late at night..,Other things such as adult men calling me ‘baby’, ‘princess’ and ‘good girl’ which is so patronising and inappropriate in a professional environment. They may not seem like much individually but for a young woman’s first year in the working world it’s not great, and I think this speaks to what can happen when inappropriate behaviour goes unchecked in younger years",,
"okay, so I was sexually assaulted by someone who was supposed to be my bestfriend. We was friends for around 4 years we were as close as anything. I invited them round my house one night and we was drinking but they drunk less then me and I drunk until I was black out. I fell asleep on my bed after throwing up and I kept coming back around and then passing back out again. It took me about a year to remember exactly what happened and to realise. I realised that each time I woke up they was on me and touching me in places that people need consent to touch you. I was extremely confused when I woke up in the morning and felt super strange I remembered not wanting to go anywhere near them but I couldn’t recall as to why. I carried on being friends with them for about a year until I finally realised the truth of what happened. I tried to speak out to my friends but ended up loosing everyone as no one believed me. I now have no one and they are now super popular. It isn’t it fair. Everyone turned a blind eye and ignored everything I said. I spoke out but wasn’t heard, this led to a lot of self destructive behaviours and self hate and always wondering as to why, why me?",,
I was asked for nudes from a year 11 and I was yr 7 at the time. One of my friends was groped by one of her friends and was repeatedly sexualised. My thigh was also slapped by a boy in my class and he asked if I liked it.,,
I lost my virginity at aged 15 at a party hosted by a group of extremely toxic and misogynistic boys in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. These boys were extremely privileged and went to schools like [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. While it was happening his friends kept coming in and breaking down the door and trying to take pictures of us. At the time this felt normal - I was so young and naive I just wanted to impress the boy I lost it too. The next day he messaged me saying that all his friends hate me because I had sex in one of their houses and that I should apologise to the boy's whose house it was. It was so humiliating and confusing at the time- as apparently it was all my fault and responsibility.,,
"I was spending time with my boyfriend at my house, but wasn’t in the mood to do anything and really only just wanted to watch a movie. He wasn’t happy with that and wanted oral, when I said no, he ignored me and chased me when I walked away from him and then proceeded to force me and force my head down. He acted completely normal after this, as if nothing had happened",,
a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] got on top of me when i was really drunk and almost passed out and kept getting with me even though my eyes were closed and i had passed out. i woke up the next morning with marks all over me and no memory of it until my friends told me. it was made into a joke and never taken seriously,,
"I was just entering six grade while dating this 7th grader… it was my first “ real relationship “ he would always manipulate me into doing this with him. If I didn’t it’ll make him “ really sad “ “it’ll hurt him” I told him I was uncomfortable and he didn’t care. When I told him how I felt, he would play the suicide card on me… this lasted 11 months.. I was only 12. The multiple sexual assault has truly ruined my life. It’s been a couple years and it still haunts me. I should’ve just listen to my mom.",,
"In freshman year, multiple girls reported that they were sexually assaulted by other boys in their grade and the situation got so bad that we needed to have an assembly for only the freshman class that dealt with consent. It seems as if it was either ineffective or that they were just preaching to the choir because a couple years later a boy was outed as a sexual assaulted and many girls spoke out about the assault and harassment committed against them. Not to mention their Student Council President of the [dates omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] school year commuted sexual assault himself and it went completely under the radar.",,
"this happened when i was in my 30s and I have always told myself it was my fault. I had been out with friend drinking and was staying in a hostel, so when we all ended the night I went back. I was drunk. I woke up to find someone having sex with me. (I still find it hard to say I was being raped) I screamed and he ran off. Turns out the night porter had let him in AND told him my room number...",,
"""I was bullied consistently throughout both of the secondary schools i attended, and didn't have very many friends, and i struggled with mental health since i was young. Due to this i always felt pressured to find ways to fit in, and in year 11 I would always hear about the girls new boyfriends, things they did, etc, and it was things i didn't want to do, however i was invested in trying to find a boyfriend, because i just wanted somebody there, hoping they'd be my best friend and supporter, all in one. I went through a rough time with my family and decided to travel to a town id never been to alone, and met this guy a year older than me. We went for a walk and he took me to the woods by a riverbank, and forced himself onto me. It was a disgusting and horrific thing and made my depression worse, i was in physical pain for days after, and mentally i still struggle sometimes. This was two years ago, and i now have a new partner who is understanding and respectful, it just hurts that he wasn't my first. Your first time should be with someone who respects you and is a joint decision.",,
i had just moved houses and my boyfriend at the time was staying over. it was a long busy day and i was completely exhausted by 12am. i kept falling asleep for brief periods and he kept waking me up by kissing me and touching me eventually i guess he got bored or horny and he turned me over took of whatever i was wearing and started to rub his penis against my bum,,
"A boy offered to walk me home because I was drunk and I’d lost my friends in the club, once we got back to my flat he asked if he could stay for a bit while he waited for his friends to leave the club so he could meet them, I felt guilty so let him stay. Out of nowhere He just grabs me and starts grinding against me telling me how hard I was making him before forcing his hand down my pants to finger me, I completely froze up and didn’t know what to do. Afterwards, he grabbed me and pinned me down on my front and pulled of my pants and underwear and started forcibly fingering me and giving me oral whilst hitting me. I don’t remember much after that because I blacked out even more, but I just was left feeling so worthless and ashamed. I think I must’ve literally cried the entire night after and every night following for ages.",,
"I was groped by an old man on a train in year 7, I’ve never thought of it deeply but it was quite traumatic at the time",,
"I was 13 years old. I fancied this sixth former at the school. He was 17, nearly 18. He groomed me over several months. One night I went to his dorm room and we ended up having sex. Other students started to find out. He stopped talking to me almost immediately. Students would make comments and jokes about it. The older kids would shout ""slag"" at me as I walked around the schools. Several teachers heard the rumours and comments. Not a single teacher asked me about it. They just pretended not to hear. My life could have turned out differently if a teacher had spoken to me about it. They knew - they just didn't want the hassle of doing anything about it. The school was not a safe place for girls. There was only 30 of us in the whole year, compared to 100 or so boys. The sexism and patriarchal culture in the school was terrible. Lots of girls had similar or worse situations. The teachers knew...no one helped.",,
"It was in P.E, and we were lining up. There was this boy behind me, and he slid his hand in my underwear and started feeling my bum, he wouldnt stop and the teachers weren't anywhere near us. It's been 11 years, and I don't think I can ever forget it.",,
"We were good friends for over a year then i went over to their house one day and no one was home except for us. We were watching a movie when i felt dizzy and passed out. I woke up and my clothes were off and they was asleep and we were in their bed. I knew what had happened and they admitted to doing it but since i had no proper evidence, they got away with it.",,
I have been sexually assaulted over 10 times and im only 14. Ive been raped 2 times and touched by boys from my school over 10 times. I use to never let them get away with it until the first time i was raped. After I was raped i felt like i couldn't stop them bc they were bigger and stronger than me but i now realize that i could have done something. But its to late now because its happened. Anyways I feel lime my story needs to be out to the world bc there are other women like me scared to come out to the world and im so scared to be doing this but i gonna.,,
"I was in a loving relationship for two years and I thought it was great. Afterwards you come to realise all the mistakes you made, which is so normal because relationships aren’t perfect. But I always felt like everyone including him thought my mistakes were worse but that’s just because they were out in the open, and I mean literally getting angry and unfair, being toxic. His mistakes were only known by me and I don’t think he even realises them so I find it really difficult to see him in the same good light when he doesn’t even notice what he’s done. I’m completely sexually inept, like insecure and pretty much rubbish at sex because I feel no comfort around someone in that way. I don’t want to say he raped me but the first time we had sex, when we were both virgins, I did say no and he slipped it in anyway to which he took it out because we didn’t have a condom and then he just freaked out about getting me pregnant with no understanding of what he’d just done. He then on other occasions told me to stop moving and stop faffing, like I was annoying him and just couldn’t have sex. He afterwards would say that I owed him take away or scratchies because boys put all the effort into sex and girls didn’t, but it’s just me who put no effort in because I mean he told me not to really. He’s a really great guy and I wish I could be his friend still, these things he thinks and does, I don’t want to excuse them, I want him to realise them and change, which he is slowly. But the issue with rape culture is that it’s been so deeply ingrained into men’s and women’s ideals that it’s impossible to get away from it and so we need to educate and not hate and cancel. He’s a good, a great guy who literally does not know what he’s done.",,
a boy i used to be good friends with met me outside of school and blackmailed me several of times to go back to his house or else he’d tell everyone what was happening or spread my nudes.. either that or he told me he’d tell evrryone i was lying and spread rimours if i tried to talk out about it. he raped me 7 times.,,
"I got raped by my ex boyfriend, I told the school and they did nothing",,
"I was in year 9, and as a 14 year old who’s just started puberty and going through changes I felt comfortable rolling up my skirt. A few weeks later a boy kept touching my thigh... I told him to stop several times but he wouldn’t so I started crying and ran out and I got sent to a different teacher and she’s told me off for rolling up my skirt so many times I couldn’t possibly even count. And I had to explain to her what happened and her response was “I have warned you several times to roll it down because you’re asking to get touched by boys”. Coming from a teacher who’s a female is absolutely disgusting and when I told my parents and she spoke to them I got accused of lying",,
"When I was about seven or eight I was sexually assaulted by my brother. He pressured me into doing things that I didn’t want to do, and when I started to say no, he stopped but made me feel extremely guilty. He never talked about it or acknowledged it until I finally confronted him this summer. It made me feel horrible and have extreme trust issues and problems in my relationships.",,
I would be terrified of having skirt checks in tutor years 7-10 because of my two male tutors. They were nice but there was always a worry that they would see something not suitable for their eyes. It was strange that female teachers were not the primary teachers doing these checks where we were on our knees.,,
"In junior school when I was around 8 a boy sat next to me in class because we had a set seating plan. He would run his hand up along my inner thigh, all the way up my skirt. I had no idea what he was doing at the time. Same boy when I was 10 would force my hand onto his crotch and his hand on mine. He once also stood behind me and dry humped me. I felt too uncomfortable to do anything, I would just be very still pretending to listen to the teacher. Never thought about it til now.",,
"Christmas that just went. He shouted at me because it wouldn’t go in... I was ‘tight’ because I was shit scared and didn’t want to have sex with him. He got angry at me because I told him repeatedly to use a condom and he didn’t want to, saying I was trash for not trusting his pull out game. We did, then he forced me to wank him to sleep, when I didn’t want to he wouldn’t hug or speak to me. I woke up to him having sex with me whilst not conscious and having woken up I was too frozen to even tell him to stop. I confronted him about it and he told me ‘consent is a gray area’ and that ‘I never said no’. He was 20 now 21, I’m not 18 yet. He did this knowing I was repeatedly assaulted by a family friend growing up.",,
I was walking in from school and these group of boys were laughing and saying do it. I took no notice until I felt them slapping and grabbing my ass. I reported what happened and the school did absolutely nothing about it,,
"It was only until recently that i discovered I was groomed and had been sexually assaulted multiple times over the past couple of years. I remember talking to people online and doing the things they told me too. I didn’t really understand what grooming was at the time and i did not know that I was being controlled. Fast forward a few years. I’m either 13 or 14. A “popular” girl from my school became friends with me. She was more into the party scene than i was so she taught me the things you do at a party. Long stories short she and I would go to parties in barely any clothes, get drunk, and let guys do whatever they want to us. I’m lucky to have gotten out of that situation but i still have to live with constant anxiety. I quit drinking and I avoid guys that use girls. However I hear other girl’s stories and when I hear the boy’s name i almost always know him. I’m scared of getting into a relationship out of fear that he might just be using me too.",,
"I never thought much of it and I don't think it is a big deal, but its something that still sticks with so it must have had an impact. I was 14 and at an outdoor film night with a few friends and another groups of boys we knew who happened to be there as well. My friends eventually left and headed back home but I was having a good time so decided to stay and wait till later to get an uber home. We were all just messing around and the guys I was with were drinking a bit but I was totally sober and still didn't drink at this point. They started getting more rowdy making me feel progressively more uncomfortable but I didn't think to do much because there were a lot of people at this outdoor event. They kept messing around talking inappropriately and describing what they would do with me if we were alone - all of which were explicit and sexual and made me feel deeply uncomfortable. At this point I decided to order an Uber home, and while waiting the boys were just ""playing around"" and one in particular was pulling me onto his lap and started aggressively grabbing my breasts and trying to unhook my bra. It was dark so no one around outside this group could really see despite being relatively public and I didn't say anything, because I felt like it was nothing and to just suck it up. I know this is no where near as damaging and impactful as many others experiences, but for a long time I convinced myself nothing inapropriate was done - no one around that night seemed to even notice and the entire group of boys were joining in, alongside blaming myself for staying alone- so I've never told anyone and convinced myself it wasn't a big deal and was my fault.",,
"I dated a boy for two weeks in the summer after A levels. After my prom he came to my house. We started to do some things but I was very clear I didn’t want to have sex. He was on top of me kissing me, had my hands pinned over my head, he had every physical advantage over me and forced himself inside me. He only stopped because I didn’t appear to be enjoying it. It should’ve never happened in the first place, it was rape. He joked afterwards when I was crying on the floor about how he was going to have blue balls on the way home. He’s since ‘apologised’ 9 months later but, idc, I can never get back what he’s taken from me. I haven’t had sex since and I have PSTD because I trusted him.",,
"In September of 2019 when i was 13 years old. i was in a food and nutrition lesson, and we was watching the teacher do a practical of what we were going to be doing in a lesson the next week. i was stood up and i was just watching what she was doing, and this boy started touching me. he ran his hand up my skirt and was touching my bum. i felt so disgusting and i just wanted him to stop. i moved but he followed and continued and he done it until the teacher had finished the practical. we had a few classes together and in another class the whole class was stood at the back whilst the teacher appointed us our new seats as it was the start of a new school year. he stood next to me on the other side of this pole with a gap behind. and he was putting his hand behind the pole in the gap and touching me. i started crying and left the class. i spoke to my friends mum who worked at the school about it because we were close. she comforted me but because of safeguarding she had to tell other members of staff. i spoke to them about it, they was asking questions like ‘did you provoke him, did you ask him too, how high was your skirt’ as if they didnt believe me at all, they said they’d move him out of my classes but never did. he stayed in my classes for 6 months after that and wouldve for the rest of the year if the covid lockdown didnt happen of march 2020. shortly after that, in december of 2019, he had sat next to me in another lesson. and was rubbing up my legs under my skirt. he was putting his muddy shoes on me and then rubbed the mud away, from my knees to near top of my thigh he was just groping. i just wanted it to stop. after about 25 minutes we was told to pack up to leave. from september 2019 to april 2020 he had been messaging me every once in a while for nudes or to meet him so he could carry on where he left off. he told everyone i asked for it or that it just didn’t happen. no one believed me. not the members of staff. not my peers. the school did nothing to support me. they let it happen time and time again.",,
"He was my house mate. He was making the drinks that night, mine were extra strong. He didn’t come on the night out but was waiting in my room when I came home. He locked my bedroom door and raped me, then went back to his room like nothing had happened. Nobody in the house believed me, my police case got dropped and uni told me I needed to get over it. Luckily I have the most supportive parents and friends who continue to support me to this day",,
"From the moment you entered the school as a girl you felt like you were just an object at a meat market. Both boys and girls were complicit in this - rating others based on their looks, saying whether they would ‘pipe’ or not and letting others’ assault and disgusting behaviours go completely unchallenged. Girls would walk across the school yard and boys would shout at them about their bums. Guys in the year above would have bets on who could get with/have sex with a girl first and then dump them as soon as they had achieved their goal. Girls were so objectified it’s disgusting (also to be fair guys were objectified too). The whole culture around sex and relationships was really messed up. The teachers were definitely aware about this but either didn’t see the problem, weren’t bothered or were too scared themselves to intervene (boys were often visibly sexist to female teachers). It’s about time someone called out this ingrained rape culture, because as is obvious from many of the other testimonies it all too often leads to something more serious. It is not just ‘banter’ and should not be considered normal in any situation. The worst thing about it was that if you tried to call out any of these behaviours you were labelled as ‘frigid’ or ‘stiff’ and ‘can’t take a joke’ by both boys and girls alike. This needs to stop!",,
"When i was in year 9, one boy in my year came up to me whilst i was eating an ice lolly and said “yo can you do that to me”. honestly, i felt disgusted that i couldn’t even eat an ice lolly without being sexualised and my friends would call me dramatic. as well as this, boys would always comment on girls in our years bums and boobs, not that it was any of their business. the boy i sat next to in maths would ask me “if i finger myself” and sexual questions. i was clearly uncomfortable. it was later found out he sexually assaulted a girl in my year. but to boys this is “dark humour” and that us girls are just sensitive. it’s not and boys don’t release how it really affects us.",,
I heard from a friend at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] that boys were playing a “game” of pull the ugliest girl. I then found out that a girl I knew was the victim of this unbeknownst to her. It’s heartbreaking that this exists.,,
Once i was walking down the road i live on in a skirt and a jumper to ho to town and this adult man was getting his temperature taken and whistled at me and said i hope im not as hot as you bbygirl i was 13,,
"a couple of years i was walking through the corridors and someone very obviously fake tripped as an excuse to grab my boob. he stood there and squeezed it before i told him to get off. he laughed it off as a joke and i felt so uncomfortable and humiliated that i just laughed it off as well, but i still remember it.",,
"I was 8. I invited one of my friends at the time to play at my place (we’re both girls) and she took some snacks with her. She told me that she wanted to try out sex. I said no but she forced me to do it and said that she wouldn’t give me the snacks if i didn’t let her do it. I know it sounds stupid but i was a little child back then and she got a little aggressive and made me scared... After that she told other of our friends that we’re lesbians and we had sex and none of them believed and after that she said that she was joking. At the time i thought it wasn’t that big of a deal, she made it seem like it was okay. I haven’t told this to my parents ever or anyone at all and i’m now 18. When i look back at it i realize that it actually has somehow affected me and that it was not okay as i thought back then. Me and her stopped being friends after a few years and later she moved away so we haven’t seen each other for a long time."",I stayed the night because I didn’t want to walk home so late at night. We shared a bed, as we’d done many times. I asked him for some water in the night as I was feeling rough from drinking, he brought me a glass of ice, no water, and he thought it was funny. I laughed along initially and then thought it was weird he wouldn’t get me any. As I tried to drift off, he started to get weird in a way I hadn’t seen before, being particularly touchy feely and didn’t want me to fall asleep. I just stayed on the edge of the bed facing away from him. ,As I tried to fall asleep felt him getting closer to me from behind, he then reached into the glass of ice and tried to put it into my knickers. I quickly told him to stop, but honestly had no idea how to handle the situation so just kept myself stiff on the edge of the bed and pretended to be asleep until I knew he was asleep. I left pretty swiftly in the morning. ,I didn’t speak to him for a long while, but later I forgave him (I have no idea why). When he went to uni a year later, he ended up doing the same thing to another close female friend. ,I hate that I stayed the night because I thought it’d be safer than walking home, I hate that I just lay there and didn’t leave straight away, I hate that I didn’t confront him, I hate that I didn’t tell anybody for months, and I hate that I could’ve prevented him from doing it again.",,
"When I was 15 I started dating a guy who went to this other school, we met at a party and dated for around 8 months. I was very obsessed with him and thought he was really great and even though he didn’t treat me that great especially towards the end, but I was super young and naive and thought I was in love. He seemed to always want to have sex. Sometimes I would go to his and he wouldn’t speak to me or tell me why and we would sit there in silence for hours it was really odd and the only way I could get him to pay me attention was to have sex with him a lot of the time I didn’t enjoy it or wasn’t in the mood. Sometimes if I refused because I wasn’t in the mood he would ‘jokingly’ use physical force on me and restrain me and at the time I never said anything. I didn’t really realise it was bad until after we broke up and I had a new boyfriend who showed me how sex is actually meant to happen and was shocked when I was really thankful that he was fine with me not being in the mood. Never got to tell the guy how it really made me feel too.",,
"I am a survivor. I survived 3 times of being raped. All by boys I knew . The first time I was 12 by a boy that was my boyfriend at the time. Even though I told him I wasn’t ready he decided he wanted to anyway because he was a bit older then me he felt he had power.I was 15, it was Halloween and I went to my friends house party , there was 4 of us in the house and I was trying to leave but my friend picked me up brought me too his sitting room and raped me. I screamed to get out but he didn’t listen to me, the other friends sat there listened to my screams. The last time I was 16 and I was out with a boy I had been talking to when he pushed me onto the ground in a field and pulled my hair and done stuff to me while I was crying and asking him not to. I am stronger then I like to believe",,
"this was recent, my dads best friends son and i were never close we usually never spoke, until recently i went on vacation with his family and friends less than a day went by and he was trying to hold my hand a lot. i didn’t think anything of it until he started moving my legs to be closer to him, i was a little suspicious about it but i didn’t say anything, until that same night he came to my bed which was close to his and started holding me and tried to touch me in weird ways. i told him to go to his bed and he kept coming back. the next day he tried to put his hand on my parts and i told him, “no” and he tried again until i moved. i ended up telling my mom the day after because my best friend kept telling me that it would benefit me. and it did :)",,
"It was at a festival and I was very drunk I have no memory of it at all. But he raped me, whilst I was unconscious.",,
"I was made to believe it was normal. I was made to believe that saying no 7/8 times was consent. I was made to believe that if I didn’t have sex, I was being a hypocrite and indecisive. I was made to believe that I was lying if I said I didn’t want it. I was looked it in eyes multiple times and told I was to have sex as they had a sex addiction. I was told by other people that I was making fake rape allocations. I was made to believe I wanted it. But when someone looks into your eyes and tells you to fuck them, over and over and over again, then there’s only so much will power you can give to say no. The consent was to just get it over and done with. I was made to cheat on my boyfriend by being manipulated into sex I didn’t want. I sat in my room and tired to kill myself and yet I was still in the wrong. Still today, I am in the wrong. I had no friends at this school, and the only friends I had were the ones who forced me to have sex. What made it worse was I was the one who was asked to leave. I was told to leave the school. Because I was the one who didn’t have the money to pay the school to let me stay. I was the problem. I have always been and still am the problem. Yea at the start I wanted to have sex (this was the first 2 times). I feel sorry for myself at that time as I didn’t no what I was about to get myself into. I didn't know that when I had sex once, that id be forced hundreds of more times. Although the rest of the school just thought I wanted it. Thought I was disgusting. I have made minimal friends from this school, and I quite frankly don’t give a fuck. So this i why I have decided to write here. I have never ever spoken about this out of fear of someone saying I’m making it all up. But after finally speaking about it to proper friends, I know that this wasn’t okay. 1 year of hell which I can finally come to peace with. Fuck you all at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Bye.",,
I have to sit next to a boy in class every day who sexually assaulted me when we were 15. Every lesson I feel like crying and I can’t stop thinking about his hand down my pants when I said no. The school know about the abuse that occurs but they brush it off by saying “not all men” I hate it here so much.,,
Maybe 4 or 5 different boys have touched my upper thighs in lessons without consent.,,
There is a group of sixth form boys who manipulate girls into sending them nudes over Snapchat and then leak them/show them to all of their friends and brag about it. They also have a groupchat where they talk about girls from motives (and girls who they are ‘friends’ with) in a disgusting way and completely sexualise them/compare their bodies and talk about all the things they want to do to them. Then they try to act like they’ve done nothing wrong.,,
I was filmed having sex with my boyfriend and it was then sent around his group of friends without my knowledge,,
"It was a wednesday afternoon and normally that’s a games day where some of the years go to the pitches I was not one of those years and I wish I was. We had a lesson of phse and we were learning about sex education, I was told by a senior teachers very high up that I needed to help him with something in his office after staring at me multiple times in the lesson. I went of course so I would not be screamed at and when I was there he kept dropping his pen and picking it up at my ankles where he stroked my calf and told me not to worry I jumped up and ran out I was terrified and I couldn’t stop shaking I’m worried because how easy he was able to get my to the office and how many other people he’s done it to",,
"This happened in the mid 80s.I was 5 or 6 years old and it happened during the summer term. We were all playing on the school field and some how I had was chased by 2 boys the same age, separated from my friends quite a distance from the building. They caught me tripped me over and pinned me down. I was so tired and tried so hard to get them off. They proceeded to lift my skirt and pull on my knickers. I just remembered hands everywhere and they were laughing. I felt relief when I saw a dinner lady notice what was happening. She approached telling them off and made them stand against the wall as punishment for the remainder of playtime. Then she turned to me her face full of disgust and said and you shouldn’t be encouraging them sort yourself out and stand against the wall (in the middle of the pair) I felt ashamed as I stood tears in my eyes, even at that age I felt surely this wasn’t right, I was frightened, I felt helpless and I didn’t want that to happen. I didn’t tell my parents and to this day they do not know. What scares me is that I now have a 7 year old, a boy has exposed himself to her in school, and two boys have grabbed her around the throat. In this school, Boys seem to have a different set of rules to girls. Other girls have been subject to worse. Punishment for chatting to much is the same as acts violence. And I have had enough. When I talk to the head about these gateway behaviours she makes me feel like I’m overreacting….",,
this is definitely much less severe than the ones i’ve read but i felt i could still share it as evidence of the toxic culture that is prevalent with people are age. once when i was on a school trip in year 8 in France this guy came up to me (bearing in mind even though it was in France most knew fluent english so it wasn’t a language issue and he knew what he meant) and asked me to “suck him” and then loads of his friends (who were all 16/17 ish) kept saying the same thing and gesturing a blow job. they also called me “very beautiful” and were standing uncomfortably close to me. at the time i told my friends and they said i should “feel flattered” but really i was upset and very uncomfortable as i was only 13. i’ve always dismissed it as a joke and laughed it off but when i got home i told my parents jokingly and they told me it was serious so i must have made it up. to this day i still feel very uncomfortable thinking about it.,,
I distinctly remember one DT lesson in year 10 (I was 14) where I was one of 2 girls in the class. Multiple boys spent the whole lesson making sexual jokes to me and laughing about it. One stared at my breasts for a long time and asked if he could put his face in them. One saw me blow sawdust off my work and then remarked I must be used to blowing things. One commented when I had glue on my hands that I’m used to having sticky stuff on my fingers. I felt like I was terrible at DT and it wasn’t my place as a girl. I ended up dropping the subject after GCSE.,,
"I went to this party with a mew friend and this girl wanted to link me but I wasn’t interested so kindly said no, so she went and hooked up with this girl and then came back and told me she would give me head and groped my dick. I called my friend and she pulled me away but then the girl went back and hooked up with the same girl straight after grabbing my dick. I feel we were both used.",,
"From the time I was in y7 boys as old as y11/12 would make sexual comments to me in the corridors about how I looked. There were even songs made up about specific body parts. It was so normal no one thought anything of it. I used to laugh it off because everyone laughed about it but I hated it and have been so insecure ever since. I’m in my twenties now and it’s never gotten better, I have therapy to discuss my fear of men/ sexual predators.",,
"On my 14th birthday I had a drunken man in his sixties try to convince me to go with him and get in his car. When I refused, he insisted on 'walking me home' and wouldn't let go of my arm. It was the middle of the afternoon. When we walked past a parked van he pushed me up against it, tried to kiss me, pressed himself against me, and put his hand down my top to grope my breasts. I was terrified that he was going to rape me. I managed to push him away and run.,When I told someone, they acted if it was no big deal, because that's just how men behaved, and pointed out that even though I hadn't been showing any skin, I'd had a close-fitting shirt on.,For years I thought this was my fault for how I dressed and because I'd been too polite and worried about negative reactions to make a fuss when he first grabbed my arm. It wasn't. Women and girls aren't responsible for men's bad behaviour.",,
Phone died on the way home from my friends house and i was staying the night at another friends house though i didn’t remember exactly where he lived. I was with a boy who knew where the friend lived and then forced me to give him a handjob otherwise he wouldnt tell me where the house i was trying to get to was and would leave me in the street at night with my phone dead,,
In yr8 this guy in the same year as me who I spoke to about 3 times in total up to this point slapped my ass infront of other classmates whilst we was all in the sports hall including teachers. I reacted in a shocked type of way that I can’t really explain that made him think I was ‘horny’ and ‘wanted more’. At this point I didn’t even know what these words meant. Later on at lunch I was standing about with my friends when he hugged me from behind rubbing himself on my ass and groped my boob and tried to keep me in this hold. I was trying hard to push him off me but he wouldn’t get off until I stomped on his foot and he told me to relax. To this day when I see him around he smiles at me and tries to start conversation and I go along with it so that the interaction will end sooner.,,
Boys had a game during the summer about how many girls they could show their dicks to or how many bums they could slap and those [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] meets and it was some sort of sick competition.,,
"During my time in high school I was the constant receiver of verbal and physical assault from males in both my year and years above. I think it’s important not to refer to them as boys. On countless occasions they would verbalise how they felt about my body and would take it in turns to run up to me and hit my bottom. I felt uncomfortable every time I walked around school, knowing I would be subjected to males loudly cat calling me and discussing my body with their friends. This is and will never be ok.",,
"a group of girls walked up behind me when i was alone on the stairs. they groped me and grabbed my ass then laughed at me when i hurried off. i was 13, they were at least 16 or 17",,
"there is a boy at my school who whenever he sees me he will grab my breasts or my butt and whenever i sit down he will sit next to me and put his hand on my inner upper thigh. i always shove him off and tell him to stop but he wouldn’t and everytime he sees me he does this. once he did in front of a teacher and they saw and they didn’t do anything about it, just laughed. i’ve tried telling him multiple times to stop but he just says that i’m no fun and that im such a prude. he also says that since i have a body as nice as mine it’s such a shame that i don’t let him touch it and it will go to waste. his friends laugh and cheer him on everytime he grabs me and he’s the son of our schools head of board so the teachers always turn a blind eye when he does something wrong or sometimes they even laugh. my friends always try to back me up and like shove him off me and push him away. all the girls have even made a group chat so if they see him in a classroom they will message onto the group chat so i can know where he is and avoid him but he’s in many of my classes. one time at a party he forced me into a bedroom and tried to take my clothes off of me and tried to get me onto the bed, but luckily he was very intoxicated and high and i wasn’t so i managed to get away from him. i feel unsafe at my own school and everyday i just want to die because of him. he makes me feel like an object abs he’s also on the swim team with me so he sees me half naked all the time and everyone tells me he always looks at me in a sexual way when i walk past. i feel like an object. i feel unworthy. i hate this.",,
"The boy was in the year above me, it was after a dance class and him and his friend found it funny to grope me after the class. I only have a leotard and tights on.",,
"I got drunk at a small gathering and ended up being out to bed as I’d vomited. I fancied this guy who had been trying it on with my friend. He came upstairs in the night, woke me up, and started talking to me. I don’t remember everything as I was inebriated. I was a 16 year old virgin. He climbed on top of me, sweet talked me, and ended up forcing himself inside me. It was so painful. We didn’t kiss or have any foreplay. He did talk to me, but I mostly just laid there. He told me to not tell anyone the next morning, but I was so confused at the time because he was a popular guy who I admired and he even made me breakfast the next morning and told me how amazing I was.",,
When is was in year 8 (13 years old) one of the boys in my year threatened to rape my sister because I didn’t want to help him with school work because he was horrible to me. Later on that year more and more boys would come up to me and touch me in places where i didn’t want to be touched. When i was in year 10 (15 years old) i brought up the boys sexuall harassment to the Head of Pastoral care and she said that it was normal and I shouldn’t take my problems any further. I then said that if any boys did it again to me or any one else in the school and someone told me I’d punch the boy. The head said that i would be suspended for protection a victim and the boy would not be punished. I was told to keep quiet and not give the school a bad name.,,
"It happen in middle school 7th grade before I was sent to the mental hospital for personal reasons. I remember this boy had looked at me in our 2 period class. We sat in the back, I knew he was looking at me but I didn't know what he was looking at. I remember what I worn that day, I was wearing leggings with a baggy hoodie. When we left for our 3rd period he came up from behind me and grab my butt and breast and said ""These are really yours?"" He was laughing when he said. It brought back stuff. I went home and told my parents knowing that I was dealing with depression and enough sexual assault they called the cops on the boy. But Yet it been years I am in highschool now I can forget the memories",,
"I was in a club, walking through the dance floor and a man reached under my skirt and touched my pants",,
"He was my boyfriend at the time. We were both 16, and he sexually assaulted me after a night out in a park on the way home. I’ve never come to terms with it and never told anyone about it apart from my current boyfriend. Just because you’re in a relationship, and they feel bad after, doesn’t mean it’s not rape.",,
"i was in year seven on my way to lunch from period 3 science, two boys in my year approached me and one of the two grabbed the others hand and pushed it against my boob. the teacher saw and did nothing.",,
"I was raped by another student in my student accommodation bedroom, I was blacked out at the time. He said he knew I was too drunk and that nothing happened.",,
My step brother used to play truth or dare with me when I was around 5 or 6. He’d always say inappropriate stuff like telling me to take my clothes off and stuff and I knew no better so I did and I stood there while he touched me and I’ve been scared for ages because of this.,,
"We were in a relationship and after explicitly saying that sex is not something I'm interested in nor is doing any other sexual acts as it was pretty early on in the relationship, the week after, he touched my vagina and then put his hands in my pants and kept trying to finger me and after I told him to stop, he told me to shut up and that i should let him have sex with me and lose my virginity that way rather than lose it by being raped by a stranger (as I had had an incident and almost been raped). After repeatedly saying no for weeks he pushed me onto my knees and pushed my head in order to give him head. I tried to break up with him and he continuously sexually coerced me into have sex with him. It made me feel disgusting and this was after I had already been warned about stories of him doing similar things with his ex.",,
"One time a boy in my year hugged me out of the blue- I didn’t know him well, I overheard him going back to his friends saying “ she has nice tits",,
"A GCSE maths teacher at the school (who was/is also part of the senior leadership team) was a really great teacher (probably the best teacher at the school). He managed to engage the really loud clever boys in our set. These boys pestered the girls constantly throughout class, asking them to sit on their laps or touching their legs under the table and the girls would go along with it because they were popular and because it seemed like a compliment as they only ever really did it to the prettier girls and stopped once you got annoyed (but why were they doing it in the first place?!). The teacher didn't really seem to mind that this was visibly going on every lesson at all. I remember one lesson, to explain what positive correlation meant, this teacher drew a graph with girl's bra size on the x-axis and percentage of girls that have a boyfriend on the y-axis, laughing with all the boys in the class as he did it. We all knew it was weird but noone said anything because, what can you say without ''overreacting''? I remember feeling really disappointed that the teacher who had made maths fun and had actively tried to convince all of the girls in our set to take maths a-level thought that was funny/appropriate. Would also add that our school insisted on regular 'skirt detentions' for girls who rolled up their skirt to fit in, but no detentions for the boys actively looking up our skirts as we walked up the stairs. I also remember a teacher telling our class that 99% of women who have an abortion regret it, not to mention that a girl in my joint form had a 'relationship' with a head of department teacher that has been very much documented in the media.",,
Raped in year 10 by a ‘best friend’,,
"I went on holiday with a friend when I was 15. She was more confident and experienced than me. I had never had a boyfriend or done anything sexual. We went out to try get a drink and met these two guys. They were quite a bit older - maybe 30 and 35. We didn’t rly think anything of it just a bit funny and after all they were going to buy us a free drink so what. They kept buying the drinks. They said they should come back to where we were staying. I didn’t want them but my friend persuaded me it would be funny. When we got in she went off with one of the guys and started having sex etc. It wasn’t her first time or anything and she wanted it. I was left alone with the other guy. He made me feel as though I should be doing the same as my friend. I said yes but I was too drunk to really know. It was horrible. I felt ashamed and disgusting in my own skin. He didn’t bother to ask if I was on the pill but then again why would I be, I was 15? I had to go with my friend to get tested and get the pill the next day in a foreign country. Worst experience ever. I never talk about.",,
"i’ve always gotten inappropriate things said to me while at this school, im 14. there’s this one boy who always runs past we while im sitting down and he grabs my chest and always says he didn’t mean too and he was just trying to get his balance back :/",,
"He was my fresher helper. It was my first month at uni. He waited until I was passed out drunk and came into my room. He didn’t use protection or cared that I was bleeding. I only found out because I found my period blood on my bedsheets, and my flatmates told me someone had left my room around 3am. I had 6 witnesses, messages from him admitting what he did… The response from the university: “there is not enough evidence to prove this was rape”. I see him often, he goes out clubbing and hangs out in my block with his friends. It’s been almost a year, and still I see his face and I feel the same atrocious feeling I had when I woke up that morning. He lives like nothing happened. I, on the other hand, have to live with this scar my whole life, and nothing will ever take it away from me.",,
"Seeing these posts has made me realise what I thought was acceptable at the time was NOT. I remember waking up to a boy I was seeing at the time fingering me. I said no I’m asleep, and then he attempted again 5 mins later. Eventually I let him as it was easier than repeatedly pretending to be asleep. At the time I justified it by thinking how it meant he must like me and how he was pinging at the time. Looking back now I realise how wrong that was, and how many similar instances I’ve experienced that I believed to be acceptable at the time but were the opposite.",,
"An old man, Id say about 60? sat next to me at the bus stop and asked for directions. he showed me his group chat which contained explicit images of multiple women and porn. when i gave him directions he lent in and tried to kiss me, i turned away but he managed to catch my cheek. i was 16 at the time",,
"When I was on holiday with some people from this school, during the night one of the guys would come into my room and try to touch me. During the day when we were at the beach he would grab my bum and boobs and press his penis against my back. In the pool he’d push his hands under my swimming costumes and finger me. This happened everyday for 2 weeks. By the end he would force me to have sex with him and give him head multiple times each night. I feel so ashamed and scared because he threatened to tell everyone I am a slut.",,
Got touched inappropriately as I was walking up the stairs,,
i was 16 at a house party and had drink quite a bit. me and a friend went to lay down on the couch and this boy from my year (who i know now from multiple others that they also have stories with him too) came up to me on the couch and forced his hands onto my thighs and held them wide open and then proceeded to rub his hands all over my genitals with force whilst his friends watched on the opposite couch. i kept shouting to him to stop and he would reply “done lie you love it” as he continued to put his hands all over my genitals and then finally i forced myself up and away and had a complete breakdown in the toilet. but only recently after a few years have i realised that was assault because i mentally blocked it out,,
My school friend came up to uni to visit another mutual friend of ours I invited him round to catch up we sat with my flat mates in the kitchen very casual then he wanted to charge his phone so he came with me to my room next thing you know he’s kissing me I say can we not he insists it’s fine and keeps going and I W kept saying let’s not multiple times and he ignored or justified it saying it’s okay it isn’t a bad thing until it got too far and he was taking off my clothes and I insisted he stopped and finally he did - I was traumatised after. He should’ve just listened the first time I said I didn’t think it was a good idea and I will also be very vocal about it as of now and say NO out loud and clear.,,
"I met this guy at a party and we were consensually making out. But soon he started fingering me without asking and it really hurt, and he stopped kissing me to ask me incredulously as to why I wasn’t touching his dick. I was inexperienced and felt like I had to go along with it. Then he asked me to suck him off and I said I wasn’t comfortable with it and I had never done it before. He said ‘there’s a first time for everything’ so I emphatically said NO. And thankfully he dropped it. We continued kissing, and I somehow ended up with my bra off before I started feeling really sick and he left me, and I then threw up. I’m glad he didn’t take further advantage of how drunk I was, but I think the consent was a bit dubious given I literally blacked out and can’t remember parts of our encounter. I am grateful nothing more happened but the feeling of being pressured into a handjob/ blowjob still stays me and what could have happened if I wasn’t forceful about it.",,
i was taken to the bathroom with a friend and they had a guy waiting for me in there and i told her no i told him not and then she pushed me down to the ground and he un buttons his pants and he puts it in my mouth i try and stop and get out but she is holding me down and he is pushing my head i was in tears and they would not stop,,
"we were good friends but i made it clear i didn’t want anything with him, one day he invited himself back to my house when i told him i just wanted to be alone and raped me on my own bed, when i told the police and provided them with evidence of him admitting what he had done to not only me but other girls they told me that “it seemed consentual” because i jokingly flirted with him in the past",,
"Stealthed by a boy when I was 17. I saw the condom on the floor next to me, and I had no idea it was wrong. I just thought it was ""normal"" because boys knew more about sex than I did, and through the effects of rape culture which I grew up with, I thought sex was a man's domain - I just thought I had to lie there and be an object for boy's pleasure - because that is what was NORMALISED and PERPEUTATED throughout my teenage years. I didn't realize the effect it had on me until my early 20s, when I realized that sex always felt like abuse to me - because in that experience, my body had been completely disrespected.",,
"I started sleeping with this boy and very soon into us dating he became increasingly possessive, leaving hickeys in visible places to “mark his territory” and so “men knew i was his”. If his friends saw me talking to a boy they didn’t know, they would come and physically drag me away. I would frequently have to shove him to get off me during sex after continuously saying that I was in pain and to stop. I was convinced everything was my fault. It took us breaking up for me to realise the mental & sexual abuse that took place in that year and half.",,
When I was 16 I was raped in the back of a cab on the way home from a party. The boy was a close friend of my best friends boyfriend. I had known him as children but we hadn’t spoken in years. He was so drunk that when I looked in his eyes they were blank and glassy as a sharks. He was strong and I was not. I made eye contact with the driver through the rear view mirror while it happened. I was crying. He looked away. My friends decided it was easier to act like it never happened and keep him around. Three years later I was diagnosed with PTSD and four years later I still have flashbacks of his hands. I don’t think he remembers any of it. I wish I didn’t.,,
"In one of my first jobs as a young female teacher, I was asked by a 15 year old male student to give him a blow job in front of the whole class. If women in a position of power are treated with such disrespect, I fear for younger women in their peer group.",,
"I went to a party on campus at my university, he made me my drink and offered me drugs. When I was so drunk I could barely stand I went to the toilet in one of the rooms, he pushed me onto the bed and wouldn’t let me leave. I can still remember the weight of his body on me, what his breath smelt like and wanting it to stop. My mind is so foggy I don’t know what happened. I remember someone walking in and asking why my trousers were undone. The next minute I was puking and having a panic attack on my way to A&E.",,
"I was 16 and taking the tube in central London as I had done for years. I was off to go meet some friends and I was alone. It was rush hour so the tube was pretty packed, packed to the point when everyone is touching and everywhere stinks of armpits. I had a full length skirt on, jumper, no skin on show, so I wasn’t feeling vulnerable. Also because I’d always felt pretty safe on London transport. The train leaves, and I felt this persons bag on my back, I ignored it because it was so cramped. But the bag started to move down my body and rested itself on my bum. And then I realised this was someone’s hands, cupping my bum. I tried to look for help, but no one noticed. And then the hands went further and they pushed their fingers inside me through my clothes. I was paralysed. From then on I didn’t want to be touched or hugged by anyone, not even family members, and I didn’t want to talk about it because I was embarrassed, I believed it was normal and this is just what life is like for a young woman.",,
We we’re at a party. I was really drunk I don’t remember how drunk he was. I’d been seeing him for a while and everyone knew that we were a ‘thing’. We weren’t official or anything and the thing that was keeping me back was I always felt uncomfortable around him. We were making out at this party and he kept asking to go to another room and was saying really explicit things. Even though I was drunk I knew I said I didn’t want to and I felt really u comfortable. He continued pressuring me and wouldn’t stop until I got quite angry. He then proceeded to put his hands up my skirt and my top and finger me even though I’d said no. This was in a room full of other people from the school. No one noticed.,,
"When I was fourteen, my highschool hosted an event outside at night and my ride (who was a senior at the time) was acting increasingly strange. He urinated in front of me and insisted I covered him up. While we walked around the event, he kept trying to convince me to go into the woods until my best friend came up and separated me from him till he had to drive me home. We stopped at a gas station and he tried to convince me to go back to his house with him. When I refused and got back in his car, he started making comments about how I had to lose my virginity by sophomore year and eventually at a red light, he started sexually assaulting me. He ripped my dress and pulled my hair. He was about to finger me before my phone rang and he abruptly pulled back. I was too shocked to do anything besides sit there and stare off into the distance. When I told the school, they gave him a slap on the wrist and he continued to harass me till he graduated. Other boys at my school said his actions weren’t inherently wrong and he probably misinterpreted my “vibe”. The truth is that he was my mentor and was supposed to do no more than drive me home.",,
This boy lied about his age saying he was 16 years old but really was 18 and he’s going around lying to girls about his age and having sex with younger girls they found out and he ran away he still lies about his age and probably still has sex with younger girls too,,
I was told “boys will be boys”,,
"i used to always add everyone back. but one time when i finally had the courage to say no to nudes, he threatened to come to my house and rape me.",,
The fact that i can name several [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys in u6th right now that have sexually assaulted girls and got away with it due to it being normalised is not okay and should not be allowed to continue,,
I was s3 and i was pushed into the pe disabled toilet but a boy in the year above. He took my phone away and tried to rip down my tights and rip open my shirt. I said no and tried to open the door. He pushed me back and pulled down his trousers for me to do smfn to him. He proceeded to rip my tights while i was refusing to do anything. My friend knew where i was so she came and banged on the door to try and get me out of there. He hid behind the locker in the toilet as i ran out. I went to pupil support and told them that i felt unsafe inside the school building. They never questioned anything and have never brought it up since. Schools don’t care.,,
"Me 17. Boyfriend 16. We were laying in bed after a long day of school I had not shirt or pants in and he had his boxers on. I was falling asleep when I snapped fully awake to a feeling of hands on my butt. Normally I wouldn’t think anything of it but I pretended to be asleep. He kept trying to touch me. I could hear him getting his fingers wet to try to insert them. I kept moving around “in my sleep” finally I had enough, and “woke up” I asked what he was doing and why he was trying to touch me while I was sleeping and he said he wasn’t and that I must have been dreaming.",,
"One day I was out with my friend we was riding horses. We saw these lads from our school and we didn't want to go past them as they were staring at us bad and whispering to eachother. We finally got up the nerves to go past them and when we did they shouted at us ""ride me like you ride them"" and stuff like that. I had to see them everyday at school after that and I felt awful as I heard them whispering as I walked past them.",,
A boy who constantly messaged me asking for nudes in the year Above followed me home one day after school with all his friends. He lives no where near me and I was petrified. I tried to get school involved but they didn’t believe me as they said they lived close and they wasn’t following me... never again have I seen them near my house... they live near town however I live [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. They would have been Walking 3 times there normal walk home if they went that way. It was so uncomfortable,,
When i was in year nine coming home from London on the train i was in a lift at [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and this man slams me against the wall and tries to undress me- he also tries to press the lifts stop button so he has ultimate time but i manage to fend him off for as long as i could until the lift reached the floor. there was a police officer on the platform but i did not feel inclined to talk to them because i felt like it was completely pointless. This man literally just walked away like nothing had happened and i just went home in shock. i was literally 14 and i cant imagine what wouldve happened if he had managed to reach the lifts stop button,,
"One day , me and my current bf were on a break and that day we had an argument. I always wanted a Boy Bestfriend who didn’t want me for sex or who just wasn’t a bigot and all of that. A boy across my street was nice and he never gave a hint like that yea we used to play around abt it but i know I wasn’t serious. Fast forward to him saying he wants to watch a movie and I asked him to bring pizza then he said he would, when he came he started to touch me inappropriately and I said stop. Then he started to force me down and I started crying , after that he stopped. I felt as so that he wasn’t a bad person, but I was wrong when I stopped crying he had asked if I was ok then I shook my head then He caught me off guard and he made me get on all fours and he did what he wanted to I tried stopping him but he went harder and I just let him and I was so in shock I couldn’t talk. When I first told my bf he didn’t believe me bc the story was so impossible but he believed me after a while of a week. It’s been a year and I’m stronger but I just feel like it’s unfair that he doesn’t get nothing done to him and he gets on with his life. Not even the worse part but his friends been knocking on my window and scaring me since then i’ve been visiting that day.",,
"The misogyny at this uni is unbelievable and it shows in the amount of times I've been sexually harassed and groped in clubs, I had a guy I had never seen, spoken to or even made eye contact with side up to me, put his hand on my thigh (I was wearing skinny jeans) and slide it across and grab my vagina through my clothes. I just walked off and when my friends said something I said to leave it because I didn't want them to get kicked out of the club for hitting him. I wish I had turned around and broken his nose. I was spiked in a club and I don't know who did it, luckily I was with a friend so they took me home and nothing bad happened. I've had slurs and insults yelled at me on the street from guys in cars, even when I was in a group. There was a girl raped ok campus next to uni accomodation last year and multiple girls raped outside clubs too and the university did absolutely nothing about it.",,
I was 14 and it was my first day. This boy started following me even though I told him to go away repeatedly. He wanted to touch me and 'hug' me although I'd never met him before and said no repeatedly. When I reported this to management the response was that he was 'a nice boy really' and it must just be me overreacting because it was my first day. He only stopped days later when I shoved him hard once as he reached to touch me. He of course found others to bother. People around me acted as though it was weird that I hadn't liked the advances.,,
"There was this teacher at my school who got a supply teacher job but never a full time job. I guess he just never went to teachers university or something. But every time I saw him he acted weird around the girls, some as young as 8. He had nick names for every one of them and flirted with them during class. He often just stopped mid teaching while sitting on there desk flirting with them. I also saw him multiple time staring at the girls asses and boobs while biting his lip. THEY WERE 8 YEARS OLD. In grade 7, 3 kids came forward to the principal about it but he was never fired, just got 2 days off without pay. It made my & everyone else’s elementary school experience really uncomfortable whenever he was our teacher.",,
"GCSE years were a weird time of being repeatedly groped by the same boy who would make fun of my ethnicity. Having my bum slapped at parties by the same person who was comparing me to a terrorist was a weird gendered and racist violence that I’m ashamed I never spoke up about. I wish I’d said I wasn’t okay with it, because maybe he didnt know, but because he was a ‘friend’ I always laughed it off for fear of being outcast for having any other reaction. All I remember is feeling uncomfortable at being touched that way and spoken to like that and not feeling brave enough to stand my ground.",,
"I was friends with a group of guys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. i liked one of the guys at the time and he kept going on and on about sending to him. i refused multiple times and he wouldn’t shut up. after he wouldn’t stop begging me to i gave in and sent to him. i thought that he didn’t ss the photos but found out he did this iphone trick where u can ss the photos without the other person knowing. A month went by and i was still gd friends with this guy. i then found out that he had sent them to 4 other guys at his skl. those pics r still out there somewhere, luckily i was still in my underwear. I can’t tell u the amount of awful photos and videos i have seen in their eyes only, dozens of other girls pics from their mates sharing them with eachother. Almost like a group chat",,
"I was raped violently over 100 times, tortured and starved, beaten black and blue by my ex whilst I tried to keep his step son safe. The trauma this has left me with is life shattering. It stays with you and creeps into every avenue of existence now. I can’t have sex now: the memories are so bad and intense. It makes me think I’ll never be able to have children. “Why didn’t you leave” say a lot of people who have no idea what being so terrified of someone really feels like. It’s incredibly isolating and you become physically and mentally weaker over time as they abuse and violate you further. I just became a walking, gaunt, sex toy.",,
There is a boy in my extended friendship group who seems to just get away with being 'rapey'. I cannot be in the same room as him but lots of my mates continue to be his friend and I really really wish that was not the case,,

Hi I have something to say I was sexually assaulted in school over a period of a few years this was in secondary school by multiple people boys my age I was grabbed between my bum cheeks when I was getting changed touched once when I was going up the stairs by an older boy once I was grabbed under the table by my penis and scrotum his hand was gripping in not strongly Though but there was another boy he in particular he started this culture to me I was shut down by the school I was at even by the headteacher and top deputies they left me to get touched have by niples twisted in lesson this kid in particular he used to say where's the proof after I told him to stop and continue I have been pressed my back against the table and blocked in when I tried to escape by another kid they would close in on me and make kissing noises to me and try to kiss me on the face I have been kissed on my hand repeatedly it would be grabbed and forced against his lips when I pulled away I have had hands wrapped around my body having my ribs stroked against my will pinned up the wall with multiple boys putting their fingers between my bum cheeks all of this was over clothing though my legs got stroked arms got touched in a sexual way because it was stroked,,
we were at an assembly and he pure pressured me into putting his hands down his pants. he then tried forcing his into mine and i told him i was on my period and without hesitation he didnt care. he then grabbed my breasts and tried putting my head in his lap but i was being loud and people were looking so he made me sit up and put his hand back in his pants. when i tried taking it out he got irritated. i was scared he was going to leave. so i kept doing as he said until the bell rang.,,

When it came to going to sleep I didn’t want to be in the same room as him so I slept on the sofa with my two best friends (make and female) who were also dating. Woke up at one point in the night to my best friend who has literally been a brother to me for years with his hands in my pants and my shirt while his girlfriend (also my other best friend) was next to him too. I didn’t tell anyone until they broke up months later and when I did, her response was to rekindle with him for a bit. I’m seeing so many posts from the other boys who were there that night and knew exactly what was going down and were enabling both of those boys.",,
I was in an abusive relationship with a pupil in my year and when it was disclosed to the school they would constantly tell him where I was so he would and could threaten and intimidate me. They involved the police despite me not being ready yet and the police officer which was sent out to me was a relative of the boy I had claims of domestic abuse and rape against. He told me it was my fault and I should learn not to “annoy” future boyfriends so hopefully I’d learn something from the abuse. One teacher who I shared the class with constantly made jokes about how funny it is that men hit women and it’s acceptable since lockdown meant there wasn’t anything else to do despite knowing the full circumstances. In the end I stopped going to school because I became severely depressed and anxious meaning I quit school at 15,,
"In year 7 I was walking home when a group of yr10 boys (around 3 of them) crossed the street and put their arm around me and tried talking to me and asking me questions. I obviously looked uncomfortable but they kept their arms around me until I bolted and ran home crying. the school were informed and I picked the boys out of the year book but the teacher just said ""oh them, they were just being friendly""",,
sexual assault within school with no attempt to resolve said problem.,,
during english and re lessons 2 different boys who sat next to me would touch my legs and touch my vagina or pull my hands to touch their dick. i couldn’t do anything as i thought it would have look obvious if i had moved seat and didn’t want people to find out. i just had to sit there until the lesson was over and i got to leave. one of the guys was the same guy who would say ‘you are just so fat and ugly’ or ‘honestly do you ever stop eating’ . i think only now that him touching me up without any consent was made okay in my head because i thought ‘at least he’s not calling me fat’,,
"My experience is nowhere near as severe as some of the stories on here but I wanted to share because I believe this can relate to some, particularly younger generations. I was in sixth form when I had my first proper 'dating' experience with a guy- he went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I didn't realise it at the time but looking back, the situation was so fucked up. I thought he was my friend at first but he became obsessed with me being so inexperienced and a virgin?. He'd repeatedly call me 'frigid' and COMPLAIN about me not wanting to go further. He thought it was funny that I had never seen or touched a penis before and would send me full on dick pics without my consent and would complain that I didn't want to reciprocate or sext him. When i did eventually send him something, he got so angry at me for asking him not to save or screenshot. He made me feel so embarrassed that I had never done anything with a guy before. (I stupidly stayed because this was the only guy attention I got whilst at school) When we were at parties together he'd refuse to kiss me unless we were gonna have sex, and I eventually caved. We had a very unstable relationship for a while, he was extremely manipulative and I was gaslighted on multiple occasions. I even went to the doctors at one point because he convinced me I was psycho for being upset (about very valid things that went on). I was told to go to therapy. - My advice to younger generations is that you should never feel embarrassed for not wanting to do something. Don't listen a person that makes you feel bad about something that is so valid. Anything that is important to you is valuable. There is absolutely nothing wrong with saying no. The feeling of worthlessness followed me for a couple years- especially after I removed myself from the situation and reflected on the countless things that happened with this one particular guy. I stayed clear from sleeping with guys/ seeing guys for a long time. Hope this helps someone.",,
"This was when I was 18. I was on mdma and walking with my friend from the club we’d been at to the tube station- it was late (like 2am), the streets were basically empty, and I wasn’t wearing a jumper. My friend kept telling me to put one on but I didn’t want to. Then as we turned the corner a drunk man grabbed me and started kissing me and feeling me up. I was so high that I didn’t really clock what was happening until my friend pulled me away from him and at the same time, some other man called out to him (it seemed like they were friends). The whole memory is hazy but he was definitely middle aged or more.",,
"Everyone normalise the amount of sexual assault that happens in socials, we were having one a few years back with [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and a lot of people were getting off with people which made everyone somehow desperate (the guys). One guy literally grabbed me by the ass and pulled me in when i had rejected him earlier that day and everyone took a video of it, it was so embarrassing seeing that video being traded around our year and the worst thing.",,
"I had a boyfriend at the time I was really vulnerable. Me being with him was weird anyway, I wasn’t in a good headspace at all and was involved in a lot of the wrong things, going out a lot, drinking, drugs you name it. Anyway, my boyfriend at the time was incredibly abusive. I would stay at his house and we would be in bed (he only had a single bed so it was really uncomfortable anyway) I would be exhausted, we would have already had sex, practically whenever I had sex with him it was because I felt I had to and just needed to get it over and done with. So I would be tried, I’d be trying to get to sleep and he would turn the tv on really loud so I couldn’t. He would whisper in my ear and grind up against me, trying to get me to sleep with him. I would pretend I was sleeping, trying to get him to get off. But he would persist and persist so I wouldn’t be able to sleep. I’d have to, just so I could sleep I’d do it. He’d get on top and I’d just exist, I’d try and think of other things to take my mind off it. It was awful, there were so many occasions that this happened. One time we were at a party and I think someone must have put something into my drink because I wouldn’t remember anything, I woke up in bed with no clothes on. I knew, but I couldn’t remember. But I also knew I wouldn’t have wanted to and if this person cared about me they wouldn’t have done this. It’s was horrific. I’ve been traumatized by it, to this day I have sleepless nights waking up worried someone’s there beside me expecting me to have sex with them. I wake up so anxious. I told my friends at the time and no one believed me, all my friends sided with him until now 5 years or so on other girls have come forward about this person, other girls have been raped, sexually assaulted you name it by this person... we all came forward, we all voiced what he did told the police, you guessed it! Nothing happened. He’s now happily at uni, probably affecting other women. My heart aches. I feel failed by the system, I feel heartbreak for the other girls this happened to. It hurts me, it invalidated my experience. It made me question everything. I still do.",,
"Someone from this school forced me to sleep with him and did the same to someone else I know. He made me feel bad for him for leading him on and even though I repeatedly said no / not this time / not today / not yet / please leave it, he wouldn’t give up. It took me years to realise that he should have stopped and rape isn’t just when you’re physically overcome but when you psychologically push someone to wear them down and guilt trip them. It still haunts me years later, but it feels too long ago to report.",,
"My driving teacher used to touch my legs as we drove (I was 17, he was probably in his 40s), as if to help me know which leg to use. He also would make comments about women’s appearance who walked around. He would often tell me when I looked ‘prettier’ or worse on some days. Took me a while to realise how inappropriate it was for him to touch my legs. I’m now afraid to properly take driving lessons years later.",,
I was at school and science. And my guy friend chose to take my phone and I want it to get it back and he necked to me and I want to go hit him back and he grabbed my arm and he wouldn’t let go but I never said to let go because I was scared and I twisted around because I thought I’ll be able to have him let go but he never let it go and supposedly he said he thought my boob was my wrist.,,
"I remember getting the private school bus home and on a regular basis a couple of the older students would walk down the aisle with their penises out, they would come over to us (me and my sisters) and shove themselves in our faces and jump on top of us, touching themselves and making us really uncomfortable. None of the other older students stopped them despite there being students even younger than us on the bus. The driver never stopped it even though he would've been able to see it in the mirrors and cameras. We laughed it off because my sister was friends with them and they were part of the popular group.",,
A PE supply teacher came in and kept looking at me up and down. At this time I wore shorts and no jacket for pe. To this day I have never worn shorts or skirts out to school or anywhere else and I have also kept my jacket on.,,
"Over the years through 1st and 3rd grade a girl on the bus wanted to play a game, The game was we would pull down our pants and show each other our parts this continued until the last day of school. When i told the principal he asked me what i was wearing, i was wearing a school uniform. I still suffer from this years later I hate looking at people in that way. I hate people looking at me in that way I always blamed it on myself for not doing something, I thought it was normal until I learned more about rape.",,
i was in my sociology class and we had a supply. I knew the boy sitting next to me but not well. he kept on putting his hand on my thigh and making me very uncomfortable. he suddenly grabbed my hand and held it aggressively for a matter of minutes and i was scared he was gonna do something. As soon as i got up to go anywhere he would stare blatenly at my bum and grab it. He then leaned in to kiss me which is when i had enough and asked to move seats.,,
"In my first year of university I was very depressed and vulnerable, but nobody knew. One night I drank way too much and went out to a club with friends. I only have fleeting recollections of meeting and kissing a guy who said he was from [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was all over the place, first telling him that nothing more was going to happen, then asking how far away his place was. I remember being back at mine and calling my friend in tears in the bathroom, and then him on top of me and hurting me, but being so paralytic drunk that I couldn't move to try and stop him. The next morning when I woke up he laughed about how drunk I was, that I kept changing my mind, and that once he'd fingered me in the club he knew he ""had me"". I was so confused about whether it was consensual or not, and told all my friends it had been. My friend later played the voicemail I'd left her where I'd cried about him being in my room and not knowing what to do, and it was laughed about by the whole flat and considered a funny story. It took me years to come to the realisation that I may have been assaulted or raped, and even now I feel uncomfortable putting a label on it.",,
I was 14. I was groped by my boyfriend at the time. He’s kept trying to do things and I kept telling him no. He didn’t listen to me,,
There was this group of boys that continually rated female students and teachers and talked about their bodies in disgusting manners. After reporting it the school only one of the boys was suspended for the body rating. The same boy came back a week later and continued to be disrespectful.,,
"At my uni halls on Halloween [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] we were having pre drinks before going to a club. There were more people than our usual group, with friends of friends invited. We were in our kitchen and I was talking to two friends of a friend (two guys, I am a girl) music was playing and all. I can’t even remember what we were talking about but one of them grabbed the back of my neck and pushed my head into his crotch. I was so shocked I didn’t even know what to do so laughed cause I felt awkward but I said wtf are you doing, he and his friend just laughed and walked away. I never told anyone until this year until girls had come forward with claims of sexual assault against the guy who did it to me.",,
"happened on two different occasions with different people, in my lessons (year 9 then second in year 10) sitting doing my work and both times the boys thought it was okay to start feeling up my leg, the first I was wearing a skirt and it put me off, so now I wear trousers and the second happened with trousers on where he also was feeling and grabbing up my leg and on my upper thigh, when I used to wear a skirt I had boys going “I can see right up your skirt” and they’d start trying to lift it up a small bit, asking what pants I had on and just too many weird little things that aren’t right , I was 13 when the boy did it the first time, 14 when the second happened",,
A guy would touch my boobs even tho I told him to stop,,
"I was 15 and kissing a girl I liked in public, in a park near some young adult men who had been getting high and they started cheering and asking for us to do it again. It’s not serious it just shows that even when trying to escape the male gaze, you exist for if.",,
I was walking home after seeing friends and they insisted that someone walked me home but I thought it would be okay. I was going to meet my dad at hampstead station and I saw a man across the road and felt weird about it. He crossed the road and eventually approached me and started touching my body under my clothes and told me to “shut up” my phone was dead but I knew my dad would be coming soon. My dad came and pushed him away but this has stayed with me and haunted me ever since.,,
"there were these two boys—they called themselves “twins.” they would pressure girls into doing sexual acts with them and when the girls would open up about it, they’d deny it. they’ve done it to ALMOST every girl.",,
"i was 13 and i was walking down the street from school to get home on a super busy highstreet and a guy walked up to me and started trying to talk to me. i was scared so i just said hi and said that i’m 13 and my parents are worried so i should leave. he said he would come with me and walked with his arm around me grouping my boobs,massaging my neck, back etc. i have no clue who he was but he was at least twenty and i shoved him off of me tried to run away and he just kept grabbing me to the point where it hurt and i couldn’t escape. i looked to people passing by for help but they looked me straight in the eyes and just kept walking. he kept asking for my number and to go back to his and he was trying to take me and r*pe me. luckily i managed to get him off of me so he wasn’t able to but it was really scary that nobody helped me. i was wearing my school uniform.",,
"I was in Year 7, and my boyfriend who was in year 10 at the time. Said that all of his friends had done anal and it was my turn next. I felt really uncomfortable and felt I had no other choice but to be anally penetrated.",,
"I was 7 when he started touching me, he then pulled me into this bush he found and started taking off my pants. I had no idea what’s was happening so I just froze and let it happen. The bush was hidden so no one saw what he did. I saw him everyday for a whole year because he was in a school class. Then he was in my class again and I was 9 we started getting closer and I was more careful. But on the last term he some how got me to go into the bushes and he made me touch him and he touch me. He continues to try to reach out to me today.",,
"honestly the environment at literally every secondary school in the uk is horrendous and jus blatantly sexualises girls. in year 7 I was told off for my skirt ‘being too short’ and that I was ‘sexualising myself’ by multiple teachers both male and female. throughout my time at school girls are constantly told off for skirt length, I have been told that I need to have more ‘respect for myself’ and need to have ‘modesty’. These are such fucking dated views, and I find it creepy that male teachers are trying to have a say in girls skirt lengths and the reasons why they can’t be short? We got a new head teacher this year and his first words to me as I entered the school gate were ‘let me see your waist band young lady’. honestly just really weird that they’re constantly obsessed with underage girls’ uniforms rather then our education?",,
"It was Period 2... And A boy touched my thigh, He didnt think anything of it but inside it made me feel uncomfortable... He knew I had a Boyfriend I was wearing a short skirt with tiights... I moaned But i didnt mean it in that way My body froze becauyse it was one of my kinks but i didnt want him to pleasure me",,
"There was this boy who was touching me inappropriately right in front of the teacher and everyone else in class, he was a male teacher and he never said anything he just smiled at me after, while everyone else was laughing. This happend twice.",,
"Ever since i was little my older cousin would always inappropriately touch me and slap my ass or use any excuse to touch my ass, one time when i was sleeping round their house i innocently fell asleep in his bed with him also in it (my brother was in the room too on a mattress on the floor), my cousin proceeded to put his hands under my bra and touch me, and then tried to put his hands down my pants, i got a sudden urge of bravery and ran to the bathroom claiming i needed the toilet. no one in my family knows about this and i have to pretend like it never happened...",,
"It started at a young age, at the age of 5 I was sexually molested by my cousin at the time I didn’t understand what that term meant, I was then later molested again by family friends , so many other events took place I actually didn’t realise I was sexually molested until I was 18 . I turned a blind eye and always thought it was my fault for not speaking up I didn’t realise the damage that it did , I have trust issues and growing up I didn’t know how to say no to people , I hated being touched or hugged for that simple reason. Till this day none of my family know and I’m slowly healing. Being Molested countless times still makes me feel dirty. A particular event that took place that made it worst was my mums friend when he made me sit on his thigh and constantly pulled me closer, throughout the day the looks he would give me made me uncomfortable I didn’t even realise that , that was weird until I read people’s testimonies. Due to the molestation I became addicted to porn and give in to boys pressuring me to send nudes however I am now recovering and doing better we thank God.",,
I was in 8th grade and I was in math class heading to lunch I got up and one of the boys sitting next to my slapped my a$$ I smacked him a crossed the face right after,,
"I was sitting in a physics class, minding my own business, where all of a sudden, a boy next to me starts fondling my arse with a 30cm ruler. I felt really uncomfortable and didn’t want to disrupt the class as it was during the important time of the Mock Exams so I just sat there waiting for him to stop. He didn’t. He carried on fondling me with the ruler and started trying to insert it up my arse. At this point I was about to get up and complain to the teacher but the ruler snapped alerting the whole class which was filled with boys. I felt humiliated as everyone thought I was the one messing around with the ruler. I complained to the teacher after but as per usual nothing happened. The student still hasn’t been reprimanded to this day and I’ve heard rumours that the boy kept the ruler as a souvenir.",,
"I had a best friend, who I trusted and could never imagine do anything doing anything to hurt me. Over a period of about 2 years i was manipulated, gaslit and forced into non consensual sexual experiences which has caused a lot of emotional trauma that i still struggle with today. He would run his hand up the inside of my thigh, in a way that I had expressly said that I wasn’t comfortable with.He suppressed my discomfort and persuaded me to believe i was in the wrong. He victimised himself, knowing i was naive enough to believe him. He viewed by body as something that was his to touch, I was scared to walk in front of him for fear he would grab my bum and make crude remarks about my body. All this happened on school property and in front of all my peers. i was manipulated into agreeing to engage in sexual activities over text, i wasn’t aware he had screen-shotted every conversation and was using this as a way to blackmail me into keeping quiet about what he had been doing to me. agreeing to these things felt like the only way that I could get this to stop, i was scared of his anger and what he would do if i ever said no. I lived in fear of the power he held over me for years, and i never spoke about what he had put me through.",,
"Nearly a year ago a guy who I’d known from school invited me over to his house. I was really bored so decided to go. I was not sexually attracted to him at all and tried to be polite about why I wasn’t interested in having sex with him. Any excuse I gave he would give me a reason back for why we should have sex, I.e. sexual coercion. I told him I was on my period and he didn’t care and said he didn’t mind period sex. I told him I hadn’t shaved, so he gave me a razor to shave. Genuinely wouldn’t accept that I wasn’t interested in having sex with him and he didn’t care.",,
"I have had so many bad experiences with men in my lifetime that if I told them all wed be here for weeks, but the worst thats ever happened to me was when I was 14, a guy that I had made out with a few months back asked me to meet him because he needed ""to talk"". The weather was really bad and he said he was feeling sickly so he manipulated me to go back to his house (he had to drive me there). He then continued to ask me repeatedly if i was a good girl and if i wanted to be touched by him down there. I kept saying no but it seemed like that made him even more aroused. He pinned me down and broke my dress but gladly all of the self defence my brother taught me kicked in and i got away from him, running out with my jumper. He caught up to me, and insisted on taking me to where my mum could pick me up. I was so scared of him that i thought i couldnt get away anyways. He brought me to town, tried to kiss me and told me I was a dirty slag and everyone knew that so no one would believe me anyways. Ive always kept quiet. Those Ive told ive not mentioned his name to, im still petrified.",,
I was sexually assaulted by a fellow student (outside of school) and yet I wasn’t believed or supported by my school. He was even put in the same small room for my GCSE exam because nothing was on my file saying that I couldn’t be anywhere near him. The same student also reportedly assuaged other students but no action was taken against him within the school to keep girls safe.,,
He raped me aggressively while I was passed out drunk and I never even knew it until a video was released with laughter in the background the next morning.,,
i was sexually assaulted at age 12 and the school helped water down the case and protect the victims,,
"Not as extreme as other testimonies, but I met up with a guy I’d been talking to, it was the second time we met up, and he suggested we went for a drive. He drove straight to some secluded woods and started to kiss me. I was fine with this and naïvely thought it was ‘romantic’ in a sense. Things got more heated which I was still okay with as it was the most interest a guy had shown in me so quickly. Then, without asking, he tried to have sex with me, it happened so quickly and I froze, and as a result my body stopped him from allowed him to get inside me, he pushed me, forcing me to give head, and then spat on his hand, and wiped it on my vagina to make it easier to get inside me. It hurt, and I laid there realising what was happening, too scared what would happen if I said no. I never heard from him again after this until he contacted me a few months later inviting me to a barbecue, blatantly unaware of how much he’d hurt me.",,
"In year 9 our whole year went on a ski-trip. On the penultimate night we all went for a karaoke night and were encouraged to dress up for a bit of fun. One of the male teachers told multiple people in our year (myself included) how lovely our legs looked, how mature we looked, and all sorts of inappropriate comments. I believe he was married. We were only 13. It is my first memory of being leered at.",,
my butt was slapped before and made me super uncomfortable.,,
"When I voiced my concerns over my personal safety walking home at night etc to the guy I was seeing at the time, he told me I didn't need to worry about any of that because I wasn't good looking enough for anyone except from him to want to rape me anyway.",,
"My first kiss: When I was 13 I went to my first party, which when I arrived had been shut down by the police and so was just about a hundred teens wandering around the streets. I had been drinking before and was very drunk/ As I was walking with my friends a boy came up to me and started talking to me. He took me down an alley way and started kissing me, and then pushed my head down to give him head. I had never even kissed anyone before and so did not really understand what was going on, but just did what he told me to do. My friends realized what was going on and that I was too drunk and needed to be taken home so they tried to come and get me, but several of his friends and formed a barrier at the end of the street where I was and while physically prevented any of my friends from helping me. While they did this they also took pictures of me. It wasn’t until afterwards that this boy left me and I found my friends. The next day I was so ashamed about what I had done, when someone called me and said there was a picture of it on facebook. I was too afraid to contact the boy who posted it myself because luckily they didn't know my name yet and so couldn’t tag me. About 5 hours later the photo was removed. I did not understand that something bad had actually happened to me, as I just felt embarrassed and terrified that I had created a bad reputation for myself. A few years later I had a boyfriend and someone told his mother that he shouldn’t date me because I was a slut and had done this. I tried to explain that what had happened was horrible for me, but was told by my boyfriend at the time that what happened was my fault, and 'pretending that I was drunk' didn't change anything. I had many experiences like this when I was at school, and it was not until I was about 18 that I realized none of it was my fault. I’m grateful nothing worse happened to me but saddened that it took so long for me to understand how pervasive the culture of sexual violence was, and that it influenced the way I was treated and how I felt about myself.",,
"I once told a good group of “friends” about how when I was 7 I was sexually assaulted. They laughed in my face, said I was lying for attention and told almost everyone in my class. They tried to justify it by saying they were joking and I was too. I wasn’t.",,
a boy at school hit my bum and i felt so uncomfortable but also shocked i didn’t know what to do.,,
The nudes that I had sent to my boyfriend of 8-months were spread around by his friends who had seen them on his phone. My junior year was ruined as I was living in such deep fear of them being seen by my parents or teachers. I never reported it to teachers or law enforcement due to the fact that there aren't laws that protect minors who go through what I did and still do.,,
inappropriate sexual comments made to me when i was 11 from older students,,
"At the time this occurred I had recently got a new boyfriend and I had invited him to a party, where he brought his friends and alcohol they had purchased. Not being used to drinking, I got intoxicated quickly and had a bad headache (something my friends were trying to help with by getting me water). My boyfriend had decided that it would be a good idea that we start kissing in a more private place. He took me there and started to kiss me and try touching me; going under my underwear despite me saying stop or I don’t want to. Despite me saying I wasn’t feeling well and wanted to stop, he shoved his dick in my mouth and pushing my head deeper into him and making me feel nauseous. He ended up finishing and resulted in me throwing up and feeling horrible. He ended up leaving the party soon after and leaving the “relationship”. At the time I never perceived it as anything close to a sexual assault but after reading some of these stories the other day, I realised that the thing I had experienced was wrong and shouldn’t happen to anyone: regardless if they’re a boy or girl. The story never got out to anyone in my year and they were oblivious to the relationship I had with this person, luckily, but really made me dread future encounters.",,
"When I was 15 I was raped at a party by a boy from [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who I considered a close friend. He made me completely vulnerable, and stripped me of my dignity, self worth and confidence. This is still something I struggle with today, and it’s not the first I’ve heard of mistreatment of women at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was too afraid to take legal action, but now I want to use this platform to share my story and my experience with boys from this school. I still feel I have completely lost my confidence and self worth. But I hope anyone that reads this learns from me to not be scared, and take action - it’s my biggest regret.",,
i was harassed by others in my year and biys have attempted to touch me,,
"From year 7, I was victim of sexual jokes and comments. I had no idea what they meant at first, and I was scared to stand up to them. The sexual jokes and comments quickly became more sinister leading to boys feeling they could touch me without my consent, finding it funny to constantly objectify my body and the body of other young girls. Girls were pitted against each other, manipulated by the idea that is was THEIR FAULT that they were being targeted, and that it was wrong to stand up for themselves. Teachers didn’t handle it right, they didn’t pick up on it, so the situation escalated, to become something much much worse. Girls, please stand up for yourselves, do not be as scared that you will be judged or it is your fault because it is most definitely not- your abuser is in the wrong. No child should be the victim of unwanted sexual comments at 12 years old or 13 or 14 or at any time. Your abuser does not control you, they cannot control who you are",,
I met this guy at an open mic night in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] last year. We were having a pretty pleasant conversation and he seemed nice enough. As we went out separate ways he asked to see me the following night. I said yes and met him in town for a drink the next evening. Throughout the whole night he asked me many times if I was ok with very small things such as touching my knee or buying me a drink. At first I thought this was sweet but by the time we got back to my flat I had said yes so many times I felt completely unable to say no when I became uncomfortable. I tried to get him to leave but he got very offended and said he thought we were going to my room. I should mention at this point he was three years older than me and I was 18 with limited sexual experience. Once he got to my room he stopped asking me if it was ok for him to do things and I had no idea how to get off the course it was going down. I was uncomfortable the whole time we were having sex but I couldn’t find the words to stop him and I just did what he asked/let him do what he wanted to me. I didn’t want to be rude and I didn’t know how to advocate for myself especially with men. I got him to leave at around 3am and as soon as he left I stripped my bedding completely and had a shower. I felt dirty and disgusting and violated. Afterwards he kept messaging me with the intention of seeing me again. When I shut down any further romantic/ sexual relationship he seemed very surprised. I don’t think he has any idea this is how I feel about what happened.,,
"I have been sexually harassed multiple times, however the incident which has left me with PTSD happened when I was 12. I was asleep in my bedroom so he came in and fingered me. The man was far over the age of 18. I was so scared that my body just froze and he thought I was asleep until I wriggled and kicked away my bedsheets and ran to my parents’ room. He now lives a normal life while I have flashbacks everyday.",,
One boy told me that if I didn’t give him head it would give him blue balls whilst another time another boy said that I had to give him head even though I didn’t want to since I had done that a few days before. In both instances I felt sexually coerced.,,
i was 13 years old when i spoke to a boy from my school on snapchat. we had never really spoken before but as we were talking it was obvious he wanted to meet for sex. i had never done anything like that before and it felt weird getting this attention. i met him knowing what i was agreeing to and we had sex after the second time of meeting. after a few times of meeting i wanted to stop. i felt like i was being pressured into going and he said on multiple occasions that if i said anything to anyone he would stop talking to me and expose me. i hated myself for getting into a situation that was so toxic. he new i would say yes to him because i was influenced by him so much.,,
"In the secondary school I attended sexual assault and blatant misogyny was incredibly normalised. Often just walking through the corridors was an invite for other male pupils to touch and grope the girls, and rarely were the girls able to defend themselves or understand the severity of what they were experiencing, and that it was assault. The teachers turned a blind eye to this constantly. The first time I was sexually assaulted by a classmate I was in year 7. I was too young to even understand what was happening to me, I just knew it made me uncomfortable. Instances like this continued to happen throughout my school experience for about 3 years, as well as some of my friends. Girls were often told to cover up, whereas boys continued to overstep boundaries despite school laws being accommodating to them and the underlying rape culture reproduction within the school. No preventative actions have been taken by the school or staff, and this is a common experience amongst the girls attending this school.",,
Boys would grab my boobs and would pretend to have sex with me in the back of the classroom while holding me down when i was 13 and the teachers just watched it all happen,,
"we were on the bus, he always called me pretty and so sexy and i didn’t like it but one day he told me he wanted to have sex with me. he touched me on my shoulders and bra and i hated it. it was uncomfortable. i still am scared of the bus",,
Always felt very uncomfortable with boys from [school names omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] many of my friends from these schools were asking what bra sizes me and my friends were and everyone joked about but it’s always made me feel very uncomfortable,,
"I was sexually assaulted by a 17 year old from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He only stopped because someone walked in, and over ft he forced me to use a hair brush and a can of deodorant to masturbate. I was 15. I begged him to not make me",,
My boyfriend of over a year would guilt me into having sex or other sexual acts saying that if I didn’t I didn’t love him or care about him. He would often persist in trying to do things to me or getting me to do things to him even after I had said no numerous times including him putting his hand up my skirt and in my trousers despite me trying to say no and push away until the point where I would just let it happen to avoid arguments as it was easier that way. He would get offended and angry if I ever said no claiming it was unfair of me to change my mind or give him false hope that we would do something because I had said yes previously. There were times where when I said no he would leave and not speak to me for hours or days or get angry at me making me feel as if I had done something wrong leaving me too scared to say no in the future as I didn’t want to cause problems. He told me I had to ask for his permission before posting on Instagram and when I didn’t he wouldn’t speak to me as according to him what I posted made me look like a slut. For this reason he also wouldn’t let me wear certain clothes because they were too ‘slutty’ and ‘showy’ and he would often tell me that everyone including his friends just look at me as a slut and think of sex and if anyone said or did anything to me it was my fault. I was also manipulated and guilt tripped into sending pics and videos even after saying no initially and then was told that they weren’t good enough. While he is my ex now I know that he still views girls and acts towards them in the same way. Schools need to teach from a young age not only of rape and the most extreme cases of it but also the less obvious cases of sexual harassment and coercion particularly within relationships as it is something that I didn’t even know I was a victim of until it was too late and often something that people do without even knowing that it is sexual harassment and can cause so much permanent damage to people.,,
"I was 13 out running in my local area about 4:30pm and as I was running through the town centre these teenage boys (probably 17/18 years old) started cat calling me and following me on their bikes down through the streets. I was glad that I’m a fast runner but have never made it home so quickly, I took a short cut and ended my run early because I was so shaken. I was 13, literally a child, and it’s happened so many times since but that was one of the most terrifying encounters",,
"i was sexually assaulted for years when i was younger, didn’t realize what was happening until a few months ago and i was crushed to know that what was happening to me wasn’t normal. i was almost raped twice i can’t remember much since i was so young and i blocked out my childhood. a part of me thinks i’m faking it for attention. i’ve never told anyone because no one would believe me. considering where i live my family would be ashamed of me. so i don’t think i’ll ever tell anyone",,
"Every single day, the boys in the class make endless jokes about raping eachother, younger girls and even discuss the girls bodies and shame those with especially larger butts or breasts. They find the idea of sexual assault amusing and have even taken things to a physical level. During year 7, a boy did a thrusting motion behind me whilst I bent over to put away my bags. This boy was fairly neutral and now appears to be quite popular amongst the careless group of boys in my form. This has been going on since the beginning of secondary school and whilst there was an assembly on sexual assault that encouraged students to speak up, all victims stay silent due to fear of it continuing and there is currently no sign of it stopping anytime soon. It has become the norm in the classroom and nobody is willing to give up on these gross 'jokes' anytime soon.",,
"when i was in year 7,, i was in the school production,, so was a boy in year nine,, we were stood backstage reading out lines just me and him and he lifted up my skirt and raped me i stayed quiet because i was scared,, this happens in school. another boy from his year sexually assaulted me on the bus to and from school multiple times most days,, he would force me to kiss him and he put his hands in my underwear,, i told him to stop but he didn’t listen. it was reported and the school did nothing to keep us separate the police only investigated him after he was continually harassing me after having his phone seized by the police. i’m left broken whilst the first boy is free( his case was dropped) and the other boy is being investigated still even though he has another 3 cases against him of the same nature,, he banged my head into a window and forced me into my seat ~ a survivor(i am now in year 9 and they will be in year 11",,
"Boys frequently talked about sex and porn in lessons. They would also call me ugly, in person and over messenger. On one occasion a group of boys told a boy who had been in my class then left the school that I’d had sex with five people in a night, and was easy. He messaged me out of nowhere asking me for sex. One boy threatened me with rape and made explicit sexual comments to me for over a month. This happened in front of a group of people, none of whom intervened.",,
"I was out with my best friend, he said he would make sure I got home safe, so when he gave me drinks and pressured me to drink them I did. He raped me on the way home. I was extremely drunk, maybe drugged. I didn’t think it counted as rape for a long time because it wasn’t violent and he used a condom and it was by my best friend. I couldn’t remember most of it until I had therapy. I’ve never felt so betrayed, the boy who said he would make sure I got home safe and I trusted, was the one who caused me to go home with trauma that lead to me now having ptsd.",,
Was sexually assualted at 9 by someone in my street who had learnt about sex at school,,
"On a year 9 camping trip with school we had a water fight. Afterwards, a couple of the girls, including myself, were asked to change out of our tops, because they were “see-through”. We were told that this was because they didn’t want to “distract the boys”, including the male teachers and workers at the campsite. We were only 13 years old, and still idea that “boys will be boys” was forced onto us from such an early age.",,
"I was at a gathering with people who I regularly hung out with. There was this guy there who I knew liked me, but I didn’t feel the same way and just tried to keep things friendly. It’s fair to say I drank too much that night and ended up in someone’s bed basically sleeping. Next thing I knew this guy was kissing me and fingering me. I didn’t even realise what happened at the time and it wasn’t till the next morning when people who were there told me what happened. Thing is they were all there, and were supposed to be my friends but no one did anything. It was clear that I was in no state to give consent nor did I encourage it. The boy then proceeded to msg me and get his friends to msg me saying that it didn’t happen. I believed that for a while bc I didn’t remember much. But I think it’s my friends who were there that didn’t protect me that hurts and the ones that backed him and made it look like I was making it up.",,
"I was in year 2 and I went with my mum and sister to this cinema place. The cinema was occupied at the time so the guy let us watch it from the back where the controls were. My younger sister sat with my mum while I was sat next to the guy. He starting massaging my shoulders and began to creep down until he reached the top of my trousers. He didn’t stop there, he continued going and stuck his hand down my pants and grabbed my butt. I was frozen with shock for a moment and didn’t know what to do, cos I didn’t understand what was going on, but I knew that I didn’t like it. I was too scared to say anything, so I waited until there was a scary part in the movie and jumped away from him and into my mums arms. I cried on the way home and refused to tell my mum what happened and didn’t tell anyone till year 8. This all happened in my school uniform.",,
"""I was in year 5 going to school on the train and a man came and sat in the four next to me and started to masturbate and kept looking at me. ,I was in year 7 coming back from a friends house and a man followed me on the train and when i moved carriages he came with me and sat and stared at me the whole time. when i was going to get off he got up from his seat so i moved back so he would sit back down, then i ran out the doors and i saw him with his face pressed against the window at me. ,When I was 15 I was on my way to see my best friend and whilst walking down my road a man on a bike (who frequently rode down my road) coughed loudly to get my attention and started whistling as i turned around. i was terrified to leave my house. ,My father would always make inappropriate comments on my body and other women in the street when i was growing up which normalised these one off comments disrespecting women, i found out recently he raped my sister when she was around 5.""",,
I got raped when I was 9,,
"Last year I was at a New Years party with a lot of uni students and I was 17. I was sat next to a guy who seemed really decent and so nice. I was really drunk as so left my phone at the table which he took to be ‘nice’. Later I approached him asking for my phone and he told me to go upstairs with him to get it. When we went inside I was so disoriented as I was still drunk. He took me to a bathroom and locked me in and forcefully got with me. I tried to push him off but he kept going harder and pulling my skirt up. I unlocked the door whilst he kissed me and ran down back to the party. I felt so overwhelming sad and disgusting and went straight to sleep before new year even hit 12, worried the guy would come and find me and do something worse",,
I was 14 when I was sexually groomed online for months by a man almost twice my age. This proceeded to him sexually assaulting me.,,
I was pressured into giving a boy head behind a tree at a gathering in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when I was 15. The boy didn’t notice that I was gagging and crying. I was really uncomfortable with it but I went to an all girls school and i was scared of being called ‘frigid’ if I said no.,,
I was at a big 18th party. I walked across the dance floor towards the bathroom. This boy who I had never met or spoken to before grabbed me. He grabbed me one hand by thigh and one on my arm and then proceed to very forcefully and aggressively kiss me using tongue while holding onto me very tight. This was also right in the middle of the party and no one did anything. I tried my best to push him off but wearing heels and the combination of alcohol it was difficult. I had bruises on my thigh and arm after the party of where he had grabbed me.,,
After talking to a guy for a while I invited him over. We just made out for a bit but made it what I thought was clear that I didn’t want to do anything more. After a while of that I stood up and He pinned me down in a position I wasn’t able to move or get him off me and proceeded to pull my clothes down and took advantage of me. I never reported it because I felt like it was my fault for inviting him over or perhaps ‘not making myself clear enough’.,,
"Girls had told me of a high profile rowing coach would man handle them in ways that would make them feel uncomfortable during sports sessions. This was reported to the school through British rowing and the school welfare system.,However the result came back saying there was not enough evidence to even investigate the incident's despite the girls very detailed testimonies.",,
boys in my school groped me and a lot of other girls just because they think they can do whatever they want.,,
"At the start of last summer I started becoming really good friends with this group of about 10 boys as I was good friends with some of them already. I used to hang out with them all summer and I was romantically involved with one of the boys. Most of the boys would joke about rape and sexual assault bar like 3. At the time though I knew it was wrong I just kind of didn’t say anything because they told me it was a “joke”. They would make jokes about raping me and one day when I tried to stand up for myself I got told I was over sensitive and couldn’t take a joke so from them on I just let them say stuff. Some of them would also inappropriately touch me “as a joke” and say things about my body. It was only recently I realised they sexually harassed, assaulted and sexualised me. I called them out on it publicly but without using names and they basically all cut me off even my bestfriend of 3 years, who looking back on it was probably one of the worst because he thought being close to me justified it. They convinced me what they were doing was ok because they weren’t rly being srs about it.",,
"I was 15 and the most alone i ever felt. no body wants to be pregnant at 15, especially when you didn’t want to have sex in the first place and especially when it was by someone you thought you could trust. he told everyone i was abusive and crazy and for years i was isolated. i didn’t even get to choose to abort it. he did.",,
i was at a sleep other with my cousin and he trued to touch me i was 11 he was 13 i froze i didn’t do anything i feel dirty from it,,
"Welp this was when i was really young and it was one of the students, my cousin to be exact. He told me he had done it with girls before in school, that it was normal🤨. it ended up happening many times i was probably 5 and up since it happened. until i was 8 years old and moved countries. no one in my family knows just yet but yeah 👩‍🍳",,
"When I was 11 up till I was 13 I was repeatedly getting touched by this one older boy, I told him that I didn't like it and told him to stop, I was then raped by him when I was 14.",,
"Guy in the year above me groped me, told my boyfriend at the time and he didn’t give a fuck because of ‘bro code’",,
Liked a girl for ages and finally got a chance with her. I only felt comfortable having sex if in a relationship so I asked if we we're a thing before properly going for it to which they said yeah and then halfway through said actually no I don't want a relationship. I said I wanted to stop but I couldn't leave the house and they didn't let me get dressed again,,
When I was at a teenage disco I was in the bathroom and was forced to suck another guy's dick. He threatened to beat me up if I didn't.,,
"I was in sixth form and I went to meet a guy who was at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He brought me back to his flat then kept asking for sex, when I agreed he refused to wear a condom and asked to film some of it. I insisted he wore a conform and refused to be filmed. I felt uncomfortable but I already felt vulnerable and tried to ignore these feelings. We started making out and he got the condom, opened the packet and carried on kissing me. I assumed he put it on and he started having (penetrative) sex with me. A minute or so later I turned my head to the side and saw that he still had the condom in the condom wrapper in his hand. I demanded he put it on and we carried on having sex. There was so many points that I know I should have left but in all honesty I was trying to impress him as he was older and felt worried what would happen if I refused. It’s not the worst experience I’ve had with a man by far but I felt deceived. I believe he intended to trick and lie to me to have sex without a condom. Whenever I tried to confront him about it later he called me a liar, which hurts. I know what I saw and I know he tried to have sex with me without a condom on when I was clear that was not what I wanted.",,
"I was sexually assaulted when walking home from school by a boy who I thought was my friend when I was 14. He even messaged me after and told me the details of what he did. I felt really horrified by it and blamed myself as I thought I had lead him on. I didn’t tell anyone at the time but I after that I stopped being friends with him. A few years later I started dating another boy, during the later parts of our relationship he became close to the boy who had assaulted me. When I showed my boyfriend at the time the messages the other boy had sent me and had asked him politely to stop being friends with him, my boyfriend told me it was years ago and that he was just joking around. I broke up with him about a year afterward but they are still friends and I still see them hanging out with each other almost daily.",,
"When i was 11, i was sexually assaulted by another boy who sat next to me in class. I didn’t quite understand what he was doing but now i’m 15, i realised his intentions.",,
"I was staying over a friends after we’d been on a night out. We went home and went to bed. I was drunk but we didn’t stay out very late and I wasn’t that drunk. At one point I thought I was dreaming that someone was touching me, to then wake up and discover her roommate was raping me. We hadn’t been out with him and I had only met him in passing a few times. I even confronted him the next morning and asked why did he do that...he tried to tell me my friend said he could (she hadn’t). I was distraught and kept thinking “what have I done” over the next few days. It didn’t hit me that I’d been raped straight away. But when I did I decided to report it to the police. The officer advised me against reporting it. His exact words were “to be honest I wouldn’t bother, it’s not going to go anywhere and it’s just going to be harder for you”. So it wasn’t even recorded, despite building myself up to even report it. That was 6 years ago and I’ve suffered with ptsd and wake screaming at night regularly ever since.",,
"i was assaulted one night when i went downstairs i’ve told many of my friends but no adults know"",I was told to shut up , they asked what she was wearing . I could not even seek help cause who would believe me ?,I struggle with depression and self harm and anxiety I lost my self my best friend . To sexual assault but even thought I’m scared and not ready to be heard . Thus is a big step sharing my story .",,
"I have so many shared experiences with the other testimonies on here. So many times I have been in a situation where I said no, and boys wouldn’t accept that. They seem to think that sexual harassment is only done by bad men on the street, not them. I say no to sex, they say please, go on, keep moving my hand or touching me with theirs. This happened to me multiple times. Why is an ignored no in that situation not seen as sexual harassment or assault? I went on a walk with a guy I was talking to. He begged me to give him a blowjob then pushed my head down and forced me to. After I told him to get off he laughed and acted like it was a joke. Told me to lighten up and said ‘well why did you come on the walk then?’. I think at age 15/16 it’s so hard to say no, you don’t want to piss the guy off or him talk shit about you to his friends. Now I know how to deal with those situations (and I think guys are more aware) but this needs to be taught at school, from age 13: a no is a no. Not ‘convince me’, not ‘maybe if you touch me or make me touch you’. We have to make boys aware that doing that is just as much ignoring consent as strangers on the street, and we have to give girls the tools to recognise those situations as unacceptable, and to deal with them in an appropriate way. We need boys (and girls) to know that if a friend has done that, it is wrong. I think [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] needs to act on this because the sex and relationship culture is quite toxic.",,
"Sexual assault/abuse wasn’t something I was really aware of when I was younger. I thought most things happening was just the norm. When I was 14 I was involved in many sexual acts at parties where I now feel like boys felt they had a right to whatever they wanted with you just because you kissed them. For example when I was on holiday once, I was kissing this boy and he kept asking if he could finger me, I said no, eventually we walked back to where everyone was and he just put his fingers up my skirt whilst we were walking. I feel like when your that young consent doesn’t really exist and when I look back now it was all very fucked up. When I was 15 I was sexually coerced into having sex after already having sex twice that day with him, I really didn’t want to have sex again and had made it apparent that I didn’t want to. He went on about it for so long and ended up giving me a choice of sexual acts I could partake in, I eventually gave in. I felt shit afterwards but also thought that it was normal to sometimes feel shit after you had sex. I didn’t realise how much it affected me until years later. A friend of my mums used to always say to me, I can’t wait until your 18 when I was 14/15/16 - one night when I was 15 he was round he sat next to me and put his arm round me which was normal but then started stroking my boob under my clothes, I felt really uncomfortable and ended up leaving the house and stayed at my friends house, he apologised on text and then came back a few weeks later and apologised again, I said it was fine. Later that night before he left he came up to my room to “apologise” again but hugged me and did the exact same thing to me under my top in my bed. I don’t think I moved for like an hour afterwards. I didn’t tell anyone expect my boyfriend because again I didn’t think it was that bad at the time, but he was also 15 at the time and didn’t really react like it was anything. I strongly believe that girls and boys need to be more educated at a younger age about sexual coercion/assault/abuse. Making someone feel bad about not wanting to have sex/ give head or anything else is not okay and it’s not a funny joke. It’s happened to me too many times and I didn’t even realise it was wrong until recently, I just thought that it was my fault for feeling like shit after because I chose to give in to it.",,
"I was 14 in year 9 and a guy I knew not well but was in my classes was behind me I went to a door attached to the staircase where he cornered me and stuck his hand down my tights I tried to stop it but couldn’t, later the school were made aware but the cameras were”off” or didn’t face in that direction I’m 20 now and my first sexual experience has affected me and the fact [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] didn’t care is sickening the guy got away with it...",,
"when I was 17 I was at a summer fair and wearing a loose kind of low cut dress (not that I think what happened is my fault for wearing said dress, I just want to give some context). A much older man (about 55/60) came up to me and asked me for directions. After giving him directions, he said thank you and reached his hand out and touched my breast. At first I thought it was an accident but I felt very embarrassed and left as soon as I could. Only looking back on it do I realise that it probably wasn’t an accident and that we was looking at my breasts the whole time.",,
"I was on an empty tube carriage because I had to be in early for a school trip and there was no one around. A man in his late 40s got on at the next stop and started staring at me and smiling making me feeling really uncomfortable so I knew I was going to get out at the next stop. Then we were caught at a red signal and he started moving closer towards me. I couldn’t even move away because I was on the central line so the carriages are separated. Then he started repeatedly asking me to suck him off- laughing at first but then angrier and more serious telling me he’d pay me. I tried so hard to ignore him because I didn’t know what to do, the train finally started moving again and I ran off.",,
"A boy sexually assaulted several girls at my school. The girls/victims raised concerns of their safety with the school as the boy/perpetrator wandered freely around, despite the ‘case’ being ongoing. The school closed off one tiny section of the school to the perpetrator, in which the girls/victims were effectively trapped if they wanted to feel safe away from the perpetrator. Meanwhile, he had the run of the rest of the school as if he had done nothing wrong. This is hardly surprising at this school. There were several instances of the school telling girls to wear longer skirts because it was “distracting” to male teachers. This and several other instances of victim blaming and failure to reprimand abusive boys meant this school played a huge part in perpetuating rape culture.",,
I was lining up to get my food at lunch and a boy in my year behind me kept talking about my ass and how “it looked good” and i didn’t hear him at the time but then after he slapped my ass and i turned around and threw my bottle at him and asked him why he done that he didn’t say anything and just laughed at me with his friends so when i went to pick my bottle up he pushed me and kept laughing,,
"I was 13. He was an upper sixth former. He was meant to be helping me with my biology revision. He picked me up from Bedford Boys after school and told me we were going to go to his house to revise. He said he wanted to get something to eat first, so we swung past the mcdonald’s and got some food. We sat in the mcdonald’s car park to eat it and we were talking, he asked me very inappropriate questions about things like wether I had done anything with boys, etc. He then started to kiss me, I had never kissed a boy before, and I didn’t want him to kiss me. I pushed him off me, but he said he would leave me in the car park and drive home on his own if I didn’t let him. So I did, I wasn’t very familiar with the area and I lived a while away, I didn’t know what else to do. He then tried to undo my blouse and touch my breasts, I told him no but he didn’t stop. He started to lift my skirt and said that if I didn’t do as I was told he was going to tell my mum that I tried to do all this to him, and that she wouldn’t believe me if I said anything else. He raped me in the back of his car with his hand over my mouth. Then he let me get back into my clothes in the back seats while he drove me home. He told me to lie to my mum or he’d talk to her instead. I was terrified. This kind of thing happens so often at Bedford Boys, I was only 13. He knew better.",,
"When I was 14, I was in a relationship with 15 year old guy. At first, I fully trusted him and loved him as he assured me he would never do anything to hurt me. Later on in the relationship, when it was starting to get physical, he was pressuring me to have sex. We were sitting on my bed, he took my trousers off, I kept on saying I didn’t want to but he wouldn’t listen to me. He started to rape me on my own bed. After that I couldn’t sleep on my bed, I found it hard to sleep without having flashbacks. He made me feel like he did nothing wrong, like it was my fault and I was being stupid for accusing him. He made me feel silent and unheard so I kept it to myself and never spoke to anyone about it for a while because I thought they wouldn’t believe me. I felt so trapped and alone like I couldn’t turn to anyone. I had serious thoughts of killing myself but I didn’t because I didn’t want to be selfish. I was stronger than that and I managed after a year of battling, to get through to the other side of the pain. I feel so much stronger as a person today even though I still struggle without my mental health.",,
When I was in 4th grade my male classmate used to rub my butt when we were in community meetings. Even though I told him I was uncomfortable we still did it. I don’t know why I didn’t speak up about it.,,
it happened in the bathroom with my abuseive boyfriend,,
"I was speaking to a guy over lockdown and we met up when we were back at university. I didn’t want to have sex the first time we met up and I made this very clear to him. We were doing bits/ not penetrative sex and then he just put his dick in me and I asked him what the hell he thought he was doing?? I’d made it so clear and said no over and over again so he knew I didn’t want to sleep with him. I ended up giving in and we had sex and I convinced myself that just by going to his house I was giving him the wrong impression. It took me a couple of weeks to realise how wrong this whole situation made me feel and now I don’t attend the lectures that I know he’s going to be in which is affecting my studies. I’ve told people about this and they made me feel naive for going to his house thinking that we wouldn’t have sex? I wish people could support my feelings, especially guys who think there’s nothing wrong with this situation.",,
"He was my boyfriend. He had run away from home and he was allowed to come to my house else he would’ve had to stay on the streets at night. We slept in the same bed and i wanted to go to sleep as he was vulnerable and i was emotionally exhausted after everything that had happened. But we proceeded to do sexual things which i was happy with but then he kept on asking me to have sex with him. I continuously kept on saying no but he kept on saying “it’s ok, it’s ok i’m not going to cum inside of you” bearing in mind we didn’t have any condoms as i didn’t get any because i felt he was in a vulnerable state and i didn’t want to. I stopped saying no because he was begging and i let it happen. Unprotected. And he felt like nothing had happened but it stayed in my mind and it felt very weird for me to think about as i didn’t want it to happen. I initially didn’t think of it as rape as he was my boyfriend and i loved him very much at the time. I’m very anxious with touch now, i don’t like people touching me unless i initiate the touch first.",,
"I was an only girl in a class full of boys because of the type of subject it was that we were studying, not popular amongst girls. I went to the cabinet to get something and a male class mate hit my backside hard with a tool. When I turned around shocked, him and his friends were laughing at it and I was too embarrassed to react. He also used to come and stand really close to me, close enough that I could feel his breath when I would be stood by myself working.",,
It was my second week of highschool. I had recently gotten out of a relationship. He had been signaling that he wanted to skip PE class with me but I always said no. That day there wasn’t a lot of people present so we had a free day. I decided I wanted to check the cycling room in my highschool gym. He followed me but i didn’t think anything of it. I went into the cycling room and no one was in there. He came up to be and grabbed me by my waist then bragged my butt and demanded that I made out with him. After what seemed like years I finally pushed him off and he called me lame. After school he kept on trying to get me to go with him. I blamed myself for months. Sometimes I can still feel his hands on me.,,
"I was on the ski trip in year 8 (12 yo at the time) and on the last night the hotel had a disco where all the schools were invited so there were lots of people ranging from 12 years old to 18, possibly older. I didn’t stay very long but as I was leaving this Italian boy (idk his age around 17-18 would be my guess) slapped my butt as he walked past me with his friends. I was with someone at the time but they didn’t see and i just froze up when it happened - i was so shocked. I had no clue what to do about it and since it was dark, I didn’t see his face so I wouldn’t be able to identify him or anything so just left the disco with my friend, in a state of shock and panic. I’ve only ever told one person about this.",,
When I was in years 4/5 of primary a boy in the year above me harassed me pretty constantly for 2 years because he had a ‘crush’ on me and I got picked on by people in both my year and the year above. Teachers did very little even though by the end I cried when he approached me as I was scared of the next round of teasing and embarrassment. Led to a lot of repression of anything to do with attraction for many years after as my brain associated crushes or anything like that very negatively. When I was in year 9 he also lied to me about it (long story) and although I didn’t believe him as his story had a lot of holes I said I did as I just wanted to put it in the past and move on. If we’d had learnt a bit more about consent in school (maybe not sexually so much at that age but more just in general) things like this could have been avoided or lessened as I said no to him countless times over those couple of years.,,
"In my secondary school there was a science teacher I had who used to act really strange about me and sexualise me in class. Like making me bend over for pens and treating me better than everyone else, making me sit at the front of the classroom right next to him. I even think he tried to inappropriately touch me once without anyone else noticing. Me and my friends all laughed it off at first but looking back we should have said something because now he’s left and that could happen to somebody else.",,
"It was a non-school uniform day and i was in year 6. i was wearing white shorts because it was summer and these two boys kept staring and laughing at me. one of them even came up to me and told me that my shorts looked a little too short. i was VERY uncomfortable so i told my teacher and she said that i should just “ignore them, your shorts aren’t short”. nothing happened to the two boys and they got away with it.",,
"Girls treated as second-class to boys by institutional culture, teachers and boys alike. To boys, the girls are sexual objects that they are used to encountering at parties (was formerly all boys' school, before girls 'let-in' which itself controversial). Any boy seen speaking to a girl at school is a 'flirt', girls given cruel names. My direct experience being filmed (non-consensual) while in a boarding house by my boyfriend's friends whilst we had sex, who hid camera in my boyfriend's room. Luckily footage wasn't caught, but if it had, I have no doubt it would have been shared round whole school.",,
One time when I was 12 one of my family member came into my room and said want to try something and I said no but he didn’t listen and he started talking to me about s*x and in the end he r*ped me and I don’t talk to him anymore,,
"at the time i didn’t realise what was happening. it was only last year in year 6. It’s also not as serious as others but i would still like to share this. Some of the boys in my class were playing a game. they wouldn’t tell the any of the girls what it was called or how to play it. Anyways some of us were watching them when this boy who always talks about dirty stuff and still does, hit my butt. i felt uncomfortable but didn’t think anything of it. until i started seeing things about sexual harassment or assault online, i realised what had happened. i don’t actually know if this is considered as sexual assault or harassment but still wanted to share it anyways :)",,
"I was 15 and at a house party. The guy who was hosting the party got quite ‘attached’ throughout the night but I didn’t think anything of it. I was laying on the floor looking at the stars with a guy mate and we were both quite drunk. I don’t remember much after that but drifting in and out of consciousness, seeing the hosts face above me and feeling his fingers inside of me still haunts me to this day. I didn’t realise or acknowledge what actually happened until recently. My guy mate did nothing either, just laid there with his arm around me",,
Boys have bet money on who would grab my waist first and said vulgar things about me. They also bet money on who would kiss me first. All without consent.,,
me and this guy were in a middle of an argument when he groped my boob. Told the school & had a talk with the head but he didn’t even get a phone call home other then be told not to do it again.,,
While I was 13 in the boys changing rooms another boy put his finger in my bum because he thought it was funny but it really wasn’t,,
When I was 6 this boy who was 11 (year 6) pretended to be my best friend he would always be with me in break times and lunchtimes one day he started inappropriately touching me and I remember him telling me to meet me in the school toilets I didn’t think anything ov it because I was so young and didn’t understand things like that but now I know what he did to me was so so wrong and it makes me so so sad every time I think about it,,
When I was in year 4-5 I was harrased by the younger years as I started puberty really early. It happened many times but one specific time I remember being pushed up against the metal railings of the school playground by atleast eight younger years who were around year 1-2 and being grabbed on my arse and breasts. I shouted for them to stop but it kept happening. My friends looked on and laughed with the kids while I was in distress. I told the teachers everytime it happened but it was written of as child's play. No one taught these kids what's right and what was wrong.,,
One time a guy who was training to be at cop and is 12 years older then me offered to drive me home from work late at night. on the way he started touching my leg and i kept moving his hand away. he pulled over on the side of the road and asked me to get something from his back seat and me thinking non of it got out the car and went into the back seat to look for it as it was almost pitch black and hard to see. he got out and stood behind me and pulled my pants down. i always thought it wasn’t SA because i never said no because i was scared but it was.,,
"I was standing there eating my walker’s crisps and my friend forced my other friend’s hand onto my arse, I felt so violated.",,
"I was at a (then) close friend’s birthday party when his best friend pulled down my clothes, exposing me to everyone around, and grabbed my boob. The close friend said it had nothing to do with him and refused to stand up for me. He even invited the perpetrator over to our house without asking how I felt for the next year and a half. I felt so unsafe and uncomfortable in my own house.",,
"A guy I was on things with coerced me into doing physical stuff with him, victimising himself and stating that he wouldn’t believe I found him attractive if I didn’t comply. He also said he would think about killing himself if I decided to end things.",,
"""I was 15."",It was my first time. He exploited me, filmed it without my consent, left his mic on so all his friends could hear and was persistent when I told him it was my first time. He then proceeded to show/send the film around the school."",I brushed it off, didn’t think it was a big deal because all the boys told me I looked good. "",I was that I now realise how wrong I was to let him get away with it. Why didn’t I say anything about it?",,
"I was at a Festival organised exclusively for students of the university. I was working at the event in morning and then joined friends. Although I was drinking I was surrounded by friends and was supposedly in a safe space. I remember going outside the event to go to the bathroom and someone got hold of me and dragged me out to this area surrounded by trees. Although it was dark and I couldn’t see very well I did not recognise him. He had one hand ripping at my clothes and the other around my throat. I tried to scream but I couldn’t. I told him I would do whatever he wanted if he took his hand off my throat. I eventually blacked out due to his hand cutting off my breathing. The next thing I remember is coming around and being propped up and wrapped in a security jacket. I was lucky that two girls saw something and went to get security. I do not remember a lot of details, whether from drink or trauma, but I remember the pain from someone being inside and my body going numb from terror. My overwhelming memory is a feeling that I was never going to make it out of that field alive.",,
"When I was younger my ‘friend’ forced his friend to kiss me right on the mouth, in doing that he also forced me I cried for hours later in my room because of how violated I felt, I was 9 and only now realise that that was a form of sexual assault",,
"When i was 8 it was my brothers birthday and we were having dinner in a restaurant. the manager came out with a cake for my brother and as we sang happy birthday the man groped me and put his hands all over my chest. my mum saw after a minute and she froze because she didn’t know what to do. i was terrified because i was never told about anything like this, my dad didn’t believe me when i told him because he said someone like the manager would never do that.",,
"I didn’t realise it at the time but I definitely experienced PTSD for a couple of months after the ***** incident. I dreamt about him constantly, the same scenario playing out in my head over and over again, I kept thinking I was seeing him walking around uni which was bizarre considering he doesn’t even go here, if anyone touched me without me knowing it was about to happen, or a tiny bit too aggressively (for me) I would feel my body freeze all over again and start to freak out (this still happens sometimes but nowhere near as frequently.),Looking back, I also found myself dissasociating for a while, thinking about it properly I think this started literally the morning after it happened. I felt very disconnected and numb to the world around me and also to myself. It felt like I was just watching myself experience all of these feelings rather than actually feeling them myself. This probably subconsciously happened to protect myself and to make me feel like my body wasn’t really my own and therefore what happened didn’t really happen to ME ( if that makes any sense.) Disassociation is probably the most bizarre set of feelings I have ever experienced and I think even more so when you don’t know there is a real and valid medical definition for what it is.,Finally, and I think this is really important for anyone who has experienced any kind of trauma, I often would wake up feeling like I had ‘gotten over’ what happened and have a really good few days or even weeks and feel proud of myself for officially having put it all to bed. I would then feel so frustrated for getting upset about it again when something triggering was said or happened. This is absolutely pointless, it is so draining to keep experiencing these emotions over and over again, but unfortunately there is no timeline for when you stop experiencing the effects of a traumatic incident and it has taken me months to accept that and be ok with it. Your body and mind deals with so much when it goes through any kind of trauma, it is completely normal and expected for it not to go away quickly and that is ok.,Talk to a therapist about it. Write it down. Take some time out for yourself to process what happened to you rather than just jumping straight back into normal life. That was one mistake I made because I was so eager to pretend it hadn’t happened and I was completely fine and so tried to carry on as normal, when in fact something fucking horrific had happened and I needed to deal with it.,Talk to your friends about it when you want to, tell them when something sets you off no matter how small it is because even just vocalising it and saying it out loud can make you feel so much better. I felt like a burden for speaking to people about it sometimes, I was always so conscious that people were finding it boring me talking about it months after it happened but actually, my friends have been so incredible and absolutely essential to me feeling a million times better about it all than I did a few months ago. Sounds like a cliche but it does get better, you’ve just got to give it real time and be patient with yourself.",,
i got followed on my way to school. the man knew i was a child and still continued to follow and catcall me . he also followed me home (close to my house) i didn’t go in of course but my mum was mad and was shouting at him and was going to hurt him,,
"When I was 15 (year 10) i was at a party in the countryside with people I had never really met before. I was well away from home and ended up staying that night. There was a guy there who was in year 12 who attended the same school as me, who I didn't know well. All of the kids were in the front room going to bed. I was laying on the sofa. The boy grabbed me and pulled me up to his chest and locked his arms round me so i couldn't move. I remember freezing up and being so confused to why he did this. He started asking me if we could go into another room, but I was well aware that everyone would notice. I kept denying and saying no, but he kept pressuring for me to do so. I finally got up and went to the bathroom to get out, but it was his invite to follow me. He took me to another room and started putting his tongue down my throat and my pants. I said I was on my period (i wasn't), so he would not touch my vagina. He did. I kept saying no. He then took me to another room where he lay me down on the sofa. He was a lot bigger than me and I couldn't move. He started fingering me and taking my bra off. This was my first proper sexual experience and it was nothing like how I had imagined. I was in complete shock and pain. I remember digging my nails into my hand so hard wishing it could end. He then started humping me and I could feel his boner. I was so shocked I felt like I wasn't in my own body and I couldn't process what was happening. I was in that room till 4AM. The next day the girl who had invited me on the trip, wanted to stay the night again with the boy and i begged and begged not to, but it was out of my reach. I was forced by her to sleep in the same bed as him and I had to endure another night of another sexual assault. She did nothing to help me when I was clearly so uncomfortable. I was coerced and pressured into something that should be consented. Looking back nearly 2 years later, I have never been the same and I've had to deal with emotional pain, stress and trauma. It also took me a long time to be comfortable around any men. I would never wish this upon my biggest enemy and I just hope more boys learn that this is not okay.",,
He was my best friend of nearly 3 years when it happened. I had just been broken up with so i was very emotionally vulnerable and he knew that too but i knew he had started to catch feelings for me as people had told me. We were at a party and he got blackout drunk because he didn’t want to see me knowing i didn’t like him in that way back. Bear in mind we were 13 at the time. My friend was having a panic attack outside due to something else that had happened but i went to help her then i came back inside to the party where i saw him stumble towards me and corner me in a place where not a lot of people could see. He started hugging me which i was fine with as he was my best friend but then it started to become too long and he was massive compared to me. He started to move his hands down my back and i tried to move them back up but he wouldn’t put them back up and he started trying to put his hands up my skirt and into my bra and i was telling him to get off but he couldn’t hear me because of the loud music. I started screaming at him and trying to push him off of me but i couldn’t because he was too strong. He proceeded to do things to me which i couldn’t stop all whilst i was trying to get him off of me and screaming at him. He started pulling my hair and trying to get my on the floor which absolutely terrified me but luckily my friend saw what was happening and got him off me and he took him somewhere else and another one of my girl friends came over and took me to the toilets and we talked and cried and i was in absolute shock. The rest of the party i couldn’t comprehend what had happened and at the end of the party he asked to walk me back to my car which i obviously said no and he gave me a hug and kissed me on the cheek. Everyone said we looked so cute together but they had no idea what had happened earlier on. I was absolutely crushed i felt like nothing. When i got in the car with my mum i just immediately broke down and told her what happened. She asked if i wanted to get the police involved but i said no because i was too scared. The next morning he started talking to me like nothing had happened. He didn’t remember what happened because he was black out drunk. The whole thing was terrible as he doesn’t know it happened and i feel like it’s gaslighted me so much. It took me nearly a month to allow my own mum to give me a hug and i’ve been to therapy for it since.,,
i got sexually assaulted after school on school grounds. I told him to stop shop touching me in my inappropriate places and he kept squeezing them. I’ve got bruises on my body now.,,
I was in year 7 or 8 at an all girls school and a sixth form boy (rugby team captain I think) shouted at me “hey little girl suck my cock” from a window across an almost empty courtyard,,
"I was sexually assaulted by my long term boyfriend when we were 17. There had been other times when I’d felt pressured into it, but nothing as black and white as this.,We were having sex and then we stopped because there was a knock on his door that he had to go and get. I put a shirt on, and when he came back I told him I didn’t want to continue. He kissed me and then flipped me over and proceeded to have sex with me even though I had told him I didn’t want to. He asked me if I was okay because I didn’t look or sound like I was enjoying it, I was on my stomach crying. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t feel like I could.,I told my best friend about it, and he said it sounded like a misunderstanding and that I should forgive him. I didn’t tell any of my other friends after that. I forgave him, but I don’t think he even knew he’d done anything wrong, I was his girlfriend after all.",,
"when I was about 6 years old, my family took a trip to Texas to visit my cousins. My brothers god brother (who was about 10) and mother tagged along with us and that was the first time he touched me. we slept in the same room, but in two separate beds. he asked me if I wanted to have some fun, I said yea but I was so innocent back then that I had no idea he meant anything sexual. He touched me and I’ve never told my family about it til this day. When I was about 9 years old, he did it again. around this time he was about 14. my mom was having a barbecue and of course he came. we were alone upstairs and he begged me to let him do it again. I said no repeatedly but he just kept begging me. this time he tried to do more than touching, but I don't think he knew what he was even doing. he tried to put it in me, but it’s like he couldn’t find any hole, I’m not sure. my mother’s friend (a man) came upstairs looking for me and I was able to get away from him. months later I finally told my mom about it, he denied it and of course his mother believed him. my mom of course believed me, I didn’t see him for a long time after that. I am now 15, he is 18. my brother and him are back cool, my mother and his mother are back friends, and he’s around again. he hasn’t tried to do anything to me since but he still makes me uncomfortable. I kind of feel some type of way that they allowed him back in our lives, and I kind of had no say. this was my third time being molested in 6 years. first by a older white man, later by another kid. some people will say he was a child as well and didn’t know better, but I know when I was younger I didn’t think about sex. I also think he was old enough to know it was wrong. well since I mentioned it, maybe I should talk about what the old man did as well. He was and still is my aunts boyfriend on my dads side. I used to love visiting them because they had a farm. I used to go over there and hand out with my now very distant cousin who lived with them. one morning I was in the bed with my aunt and him and she got up to shower. I remember this day very vividly although I was just four years old. he was showing me a talking fish alarm clock that I thought was really cool. he proceeded to ask me did I want to see something else cool, of course I answered yes, he told me he was gonna show me a “snake” and that I should close my eyes. I closed my eyes and he guided my hand towards the “snake”, when I opened my eyes it was his penis. he told me to rub it and to never tell anyone. I went home this same night, and I used to sleep with my brother and night because I didn’t like being alone. I told my brother and told him not to tell anyone just like the man told me. my brother was about seven or eight at the time, he knew it was wrong and went and told my mother. she sat me down and asked me questions and the next day we went to the police. I am a little black girl and the man was white.. so you know the rest. nothing ever happened. til this day it still affects my relationship with some of my family members, me and my aunt never speak and I just noticed that I hold grudges, lol. She is still with him til this day and I hate her for it. I am not close with any of my family members on my dad side because of this. I also want to say that girls rape too. 1/3 time periods was by a girl, the story with her is weird and is something I can really type in a way you would understand. but I mention this just to bring awareness.",,
When I was 9 my cousin made me do sexual things with her and it made me want to die because I felt like it was my fault.,,
I was violently raped during the summer holidays in 1994 by my uncle at my family home. I was 14. I hid it from my mum and my father wasn’t there. My grades and behaviour changed the following school year when we went back. Nobody questioned it or me. I considered telling a teacher but during that conversation he put his hand on my knee to comfort me before moving it up and underneath my skirt. I’ve never forgotten it. I’d already been assaulted and now someone supposed to keep me safe was doing the same. I never reported the assault but my rapist is serving a life sentence.,,
"At 17 a troll anonymous account was harassing me calling me a slut, telling me I was ugly. Asking if I wanted to meet up and just spewing verbal abuse at me through facebook messenger. I got sent a voicenote which the guy/guys (because I think there was someone in the background) told me they were going to rape me. I reported the conversation to facebook and they told me it didn’t breach community guidelines. I never reported it to the police because if facebook couldn’t help with an online matter what was the police going to do? No one except one friend who it was happening to from the same troll account knows that this happened. We’re in our mid 20’s now.",,
"Male teachers going out of their way to make sport uniform checks. At one stage a male member of staff stood outside our locker room so he could check what clothes everyone was wearing after changing. It wasn't his specific job but he went out of his way to wait there at lunchtimes. He was a teacher that knew lots of us fancied him, who also once told a girl he could see up her skirt while she walked up stairs. We were 15. At the time (~2013) I know I never thought twice about it but looking back it makes me uncomfortable.",,
"The dress codes were used to control us as girls, and encouraged discourse about how Girls must prevent dressing “provocatively” as it encourages male teachers to sexualise us, or make us to blame for sexual harassment. Male teachers would call us out in front of the whole class, shaming us for showing our shoulders, or wearing a skirt that they deemed too short, not specifically defined in the dress code. It made girls feel extremely targeted and uncomfortable, and even the female teachers calling us to blame as we reported incidents of male teachers behaving inappropriately with us. I wish the topic of dress codes was talked more about in schools and not used to blame women, as it leads to victim blaming in the wider world, when it should be men that need to be educated about sexual harassment, verbal and physical.",,
"Someone kissed me on the bus when I was only 11. My family was there but they didn’t see anything. It made me feel so dirty and worthless. When I was 14 I was in a car and this guy was following us, deliberately slowing down so only I could see him (I was in the back seat) and showed me explicit pictures on his phone. He followed us for at least 15 minutes.",,
"Throughout my whole school career I, along with several other young girls, faced a lot of sexual harassment and abuse. One time period that i know was difficult for most girls was year 9 when i think we had all hit puberty by then and the boys had noticed. Everyone knew the queue for the food hut was where you got touched, and it was normalised and some days you jsut had to choose wether you wanted to be harassed, or go hungry. It was mostly just “jokey” touching of my boobs or thoughts but multiple times a boy went up my skirt whilst i was only wearing socks and groped my bum and went near my vagina. His friends laughed, and the teachers that knew this was going on did nothing. I feel sorry for the girls it’s happened to and the ones who are there now.",,
"I was only 9, we were in PE and he touched me, in places where he shouldn't of. I had to laugh it off, i was a nieve innocent 9 year old primary school girl who was so rapidly exposed to this new world of danger and I felt violated. It was never the schools fault and they were the most supportive school ever, i just had never expected it to have happened. Last year he laughed at people joking about unconsensually touching girls, it hurt to say the least.",,
he wouldn’t listen to me and just continued to push me to kiss him,,
a guy i thought was my friend went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and he sexually assaulted me and all he gets is defence and so many people believe “his side of the story” which consists of “it was an accident/ i didn’t know what i was doing” and he told my boyfriend that he had had a bit to drink which he didn’t. he held me down and persistently tried to finger me and rub me and i couldn’t pull him off sad thing is so many girls even defend him and to my knowledge those girls mostly go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and he went [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity],,

I didn't realise this until reading your posts but I went to a party and got totally blackout drunk. I woke up not remembering a thing and being told by other people we'd had sex. The only sign i had of it was blood in my knickers the next day. I always thought it was fine until I read your posts that this isn't okay.,,
"I was in a lesson in sixth form arguing with a boy in the class about an academic point. He attempted to shut down the argument by loudly saying to me, from the other side of the table set-up, “I can see your pussy”. My classmates laughed.,My teacher was right there in the classroom and didn’t say anything, didn’t even react to this. At the time I didn’t even question whether he should have, let alone whether the boy should have said that to me. The vibe of Westminster when I was there was that you just fend for yourself. 100% among pupils, 90% among staff.",,
"In response to these submissions, I know that a lot of the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys are feeling defensive. Thinking that some of these submissions ""aren't that bad"". It's all bad, it's all part of an awful environment that is continually nurtured by no one calling it out. This isn't an attack. We've all had enough, we all need to be part of the solution. Talking to the school. Talking to younger siblings. I know a lot of younger siblings at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who feel pressure to be more sexually active at a younger age either because they want to impress their siblings and their friends or their siblings put pressure on the to be cool. This has caused quite a few years at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] to mature sexually much faster than the year above them.",,
I didn't ask and I wasn't doing anything sexual or even coming onto him in anyway. He ran his hand up the inside of my thigh and up to my crotch whilst we were out with others from school. He knew a liked him and that I wouldn't have the guts to tell anyone. The others saw but they never told anyone. He was in my year group but almost 12 months older than me. My crime was thinking I could wear shorts in the summer.,,
I made friends with a boy from college and one of our mutual friends was having a party I was groped by this boy multiple times I didn’t consent to being touched like that and I told him to stop. I was too afraid to tell anyone because I didn’t think it was as serious as other stories I had heard,,
"From the age of 14 years old the boys would start making “fit lists” that would go around our school, pitting the girls against one another. When the girls started growing boobs, boys in the year would grab you when walking through the corridor and put their hands up our skirts. We were on a school trip and a boy came and sat next to me on the bus and put his blazer over us and when I wouldn’t kiss him or let him touch me he called me frigid repeatedly, as did his friends. I lost my virginity at 14 because I felt a pressure to and the boys would then leave me alone as I started dating someone in the year who they were afraid of. He was also verbally abusive and would call me a slut for talking to other boys and would constantly check my phone but staying with him meant that I was safe from the other boys in the year. There are so many examples of sexual assault, harassment and abuse but I remember being at a party and the boys were huddled together and two of them were making the other boys sniff their fingers and they said they had both fingered one of my friends, were calling her “loose”, I went looking for her and found her extremely drunk and semi-conscious. At another party another friend was extremely drunk and a boy was fingering her publicly and everyone started taking pictures. I then had to get her home after she passed out from drinking and when we went into school the next day, everyone had the picture. At the end of sixth form I had fallen asleep at my friends house after we had been drinking and I woke up to my trousers down and my friend sexually assaulting me. I was half asleep but then realised what was going on and ran out of the house and tried to get home. When I got back to my Mum I had told her what happened and I begged her not to call the police because I was scared. He text me the next day saying sorry for taking things too far. I then told my friends and they all carried on being friends with him and said that they find it hard to be mad at him. He was best friends with my boyfriend and I had to see him at every party, I’m not sure if people didn’t believe me or just didn’t care. This type of behaviour was normalised throughout school, I was one of the lucky ones as it only happened to me once. I believe that this rape culture sets in very early and it sets women up to be abused and also turns them against each other. I was angry at the girls who didn’t support me, sometimes more than the boy that actually assaulted me. I realise now that that isn’t right. If I could go back in time I would stand up for the other girls more because I excused so much behaviour from the boys that was actually a starting sign of something much darker.",,
"I was 14 and sat next to my dad’s friend at a restaurant. He was being friendly and asking me how life was going etc and then I felt his hand firmly on my thigh, rubbing it up and down. I crossed my legs trapping his hand in between by accident, I was hoping it would make him take it off. I’m sure he didn’t mean anything by it and he was drunk but I never want to see him again, I felt really uncomfortable. I told my parents I was shocked but it felt like no one thought it was that bad.",,
When I was 14 I was mentally abuse and raped by someone I was close to.,,
"I was at a party (pre covid) and I walked in with a couple of my guy friends and i immediately saw this boy kissing a girl i knew, i didn’t think much of it until he saw me and my guy friends and he physically dropped her so he could come and talk to us. she was unconscious and he was fingering her, her skirt was pulled us around her waist and the front strap of her top had been snapped so her bra was exposed. i have never bee mitre terrified in my life as i know what this boy is capable of, he has followed me home on one occasion, insistent on walking me home and he ends up sexually assaulting me outside my own house. my guy friends did nothing about it either and they found it funny. i would have done something if i wasn’t petrified it would have been me next",,
I was 7 and all the people in my year had in school doctor check ups. He touched me and made me touch him. I’ve never told anyone because I still believe it was my fault. But I was 7... I still wonder if it happened to any other people in my year. I still have nightmares about it to this day.,,
"I was 16 years old, on holiday and happened to be in the same resort as a boy in my year at school. I had a boyfriend at the time and they were both friends. His family invited me to a party near the resort and we both hung out & had some drinks. During the party we were chatting in the main house and he proceeds to grab my breast, clearly had a boner - I swiftly removed his hand. He then says ‘what happens in X stays in X” (x being the destination) and that my boyfriend never needed to know. He then proceeded to insist I give him head; I refused. Then I ran to the bathroom to call my boyfriend and he proceeded knocking on the door and harassing me whilst I was in the bathroom. Then, after leaving the bathroom I then ran to a room populated by other people and later we left the party all in the same car. He was sitting next to me in the car (his parents in the front) and then continued to grope me and try and put his hands in my underwear in the car on the way back. I didn’t say anything as his family were right there and kept trying to push his hands away. The next day, he realised what he had done and apologised, said he had drank too much, couldn’t remember and begged me not to tell anyone at school. I didn’t - I was too afraid my school wouldn’t believe me and his family were too influential. He then proceeded to be in a position of leadership for the next 2 years at my school and has never been held accountable for his actions.",,
someone got me in the toilets and put something hard in my mouth,,
"i linked this boy at this school and when things were not going well at all , we were ending things basically. I got sent a pic from him in another girls bed which I didn’t really care at the time but then he sent a picture of the girl in her room and she was naked but so obviously unaware he was taking the photo . I’ve never told the girl as it would feel so embarrassing and he really doesn’t deserve to be thought about by anyone. Him and his group treat girls like they’re disposable, passing girls around, calling them loose and easy to their face and behind their backs for ‘agreeing’ to be passed around. They go from a friendship group of girls to the next group of girls when they’re bored or got with all of a group. I think that this group isn’t the only group in the school to have this mindset about girls as I’ve had multiple boys from different groups pop up from this school, insistently asking for nudes or a beat . and when I say no they sometimes spread that I did do it and it’s some sorta trophy for them as well as a way to degrade and call me easy. This school hasn’t been addressed yet but it needs to be.",,
"I had my first intimate boyfriend when i was 15. We went on holiday with my family when i was 15 and he was 16. One of the mornings, i woke up to him forcing himself into me. I asked what he was doing and he said that because we were spooning and i was in that position that he thought it was okay even though i was clearly asleep. He then started crying after i confronted him saying ‘how could you accuse me of something like that’. He fell out with me for the whole day, and i ended up apologising because of how he manipulated the situation to make me feel i was in the wrong. Throughout the rest of the relationship (3years) he would continue to touch me in my sleep, whether it was my breasts, touching my privates and even forcing himself in. Obviously, i would wake up but because of what happened before i was too scared to confront him in case he would fall out with me or threaten to leave me. I just let it happen, and i regret that every day. He would continue to do this for the rest of the three years, and i saw it as being almost normal until i realised after the relationship ended that he manipulated me in so many ways into thinking the rape and sexual assault was okay. It doesn't always have to be violent. Its emotional and scary too. We can’t always fight back, it so hard in the moment especially when its someone you thought cared and loved for you. He would also pressure me for sex, if i said no im not in the mood, he would keep pushing and touching me until i gave in just to get him to leave me alone. He would make jokes threatening a domestic on me in front of his friends and they all laughed along, it wasn’t funny. It scared me. Just because he was my boyfriend, it did not give him the right to take my body whenever he wanted. Its still rape, and i only realised that and how bad he was after i got out of the relationship.",,
"I was in secondary school and started speaking to a boy for a couple of months. He led me on and begged me for nudes every single night. If he asked me during the day and I said no maybe later he would then ask me later and say that I ‘owed him and promised’ and felt bad and ended up sending it. He screenshotted and saved to camera roll and promised he wouldn’t show anyone. Next day the pictures were sent around on the boys groupchat and around the whole school. A random guy came up to me and said he saw that picture in his Spanish class and got hard and had to go to the bathroom to wank it off. I would get comments every day calling me names and a slut, whore, ‘easy’ since this boy was younger than me. The pictures are on many peoples phones and he lied to me that he deleted them because he showed someone them the following day after a month of sending them around so I’m pretty sure their still on his phone and many other peoples.",,
There is a group of guys in year 12 at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who take advantage of drunk girls at motives and generally just display really creepy behavior. I feel afraid to be around these boys at motives and i’ve seen them sexually assault and harass many girls. These guys are disgusting and they deserve to be punished,,
I was sexually assaulted by my best friend (male) and my nudes were leaked around school. I later found out that there was a large group of guys that had a group chat where they would share girls nudes that they had received.,,
I was stealthed by a guy that I trusted (when they remove the condom without telling you) and then after he tried to deny it. I felt so violated and hurt.,,
"I met up with a guy I was friends with and we kissed, I didn’t want to do anything else but stayed at his. I told him I didn’t want to do anything else but I had missed my last train home, we were in his room and I wanted to sleep but he got naked. He then made me put my hand on his penis and begged me to give him head. I said no I didn’t want to and went down to the kitchen. He then en coerced me into giving him a hand job. I felt like it was the only way I could get it to stop. I didn’t tell anyone and I don’t really remember the details it almost seemed too traumatic to ever think of again.",,
"In 2019, I was with my boyfriend at the time. We were watching a movie and he wanted to have sex, but I didn’t. He forced himself onto me and shoved my face into a pillow so he didn’t have to listen to me telling him to stop. I’ve only been able to tell a few people what happened since.",,
"This is nowhere near as extreme as some of the other testimonies but a boy I was with would send snaps to his friends whilst I was in the background in my underwear without my knowledge as well as telling his friends everything we did in bed which got spread around, getting him ‘lad points’ whilst I got slut shamed. [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is just as bad, if not worse; the way I have heard [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys talk about me/ other girls behind our backs is honestly disgusting from making rape jokes (some having actually assaulted girls) to constantly ranking girls based on body and rating them on how much they’d like to fuck them (whilst simultaneously slut shaming many of the girls they had had sex with).",,
I didn't think much of it as it was my ex boyfriend. But I knew he had a crush on me ever since we broke up cuz he cheated on me but he kept making sexual remarks to me and sexually harassed me,,
"When I was at school here (late 90s), one of the boys kept grabbing my bum in lessons. I shouted at him to stop but no-one took it seriously. It took two of the girls repeatedly talking to the teacher and insisting it was not okay before she eventually told him to stop.",,
"recently i got drunk with one of my friends and i was virtually black out drunk, i threw up 6 times that evening so i have very little memory of what happened. i’ve slowly been piecing everything together and i’ve realised that she coerced me into having sex with her because i’m the only out girl she knows and i’m apparently the only girl she’d be comfortable trying lesbian sex with. it’s not something i would’ve consented to if i was sober, or even a little bit drunk at all. i just felt like i had to because she initiated it and i was too fucked to say no. i feel like it’s all my fault though because it’s messed up a talking stage that i’m in because he doesn’t know that i didn’t consent to what happens, he just thinks i’ve cheated. i have no idea what to do with myself.",,
"Sexually assaulted multiple times in and out of school. At times witnessed by the entire class. Many supported me, but enough didn’t. The head teacher told me it was as much my fault as his. ‘6 of one and half a dozen of the other’ to be precise. Nothing was done. I was kept on my own for weeks out of lessons in a classroom by myself. I tried to commit suicide due to the depression I fell into. I wasn’t safe in school. More recently many members of my class have told me they saw it happen and they never spoke up because they knew how corrupt his mum was. (She works in the school)",,
"It was broad daylight, I was walking down the busiest street in my city with my boyfriend right next to me wearing baggy jeans and a jumper. Out of no where some guy grabs my ass really hard and I freeze start crying. My boyfriend asked me who it was/wanted to run after the guy but I said no because ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss’. I still think about that a lot and don’t feel safe anywhere.",,
I was groped by a student in the hallway when I was seven years old.,,
"I hate how every time i go outside in something i feel comfortable in, i get either whistled at or get stared at by old white males. It makes me mad, that i a young female cant go outside without being looked at inappropriately. I just want to live my life.",,
We grow up believing that school is a safe place and that nothing bad will happen to you but that isn’t true,,
Raped twice in my own accommodation by someone I knew when I was black out drunk,,
"We met through a mutual friend and he seemed cool, he seemed hippy and he lived closer to us than our mutual friend so he started to bring us stuff from the mutual. The guy spoke kind of posh but would sometimes put on a voice. We met a lot probably about 20 times at my house. He would wear a blue uniform but we realised afterwards that it wasn’t his real uniform (stolen). He also went by a fake name that turned out the be a movie characters name from a movie he kept recommending but none of us ever watched called American psycho. The guy was always friendly to my younger brother (he’s just a year younger) that we hung out with. It turns out him and my brother were doing shit behind our backs the whole time. It’s not a homophobic thing it’s just he used a fake name and school it’s so creepy I don’t know if anyone has had a similar story. The fake name he used was [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], it’s confusing because my brother says he was always fine with it but when he got found out he disappeared.",,
"I was raped at a party by my boyfriend who had given me loads to drink. I passed out and woke up with him sexually assaulting me. I didn’t properly recognise what had happened to me and never spoke about it to anyone. He was my boyfriend, who became my husband (now ex) so it was OK, wasn’t it? This was over 45 years ago and I understand only recently how I was violated.",,
"An old [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boy groomed me in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when I was 15 and he was 26. Over the course of the next 4 years he raped me three times, gaslit me, shared photos of me without my consent and engaged in extremely violent sexual practices which left me feeling traumatised and worthless. He is now fairly well known working in a high profile media job.",,
"I was sat outside at a wooden table in my school yard during a lunch last year, sat with one of my close friends of the time he started of just by pitting his hand on my thigh but i was obviously uncomfortable and he kept going up my skirt higher and higher. i just froze. all my friends saw and others too but no one ever said anything at the time or after to me or to him.",,
When I was in year 9 I was sexually abused and almost raped by my ex best friend. if it wasn't for my current partner I would have probably been raped. I'm so lucky that my partner was there and saved me,,
"Me and my ex boyfriend were together through school then last summer we reconnected a few years after breaking up and started to sleep with each other again. He had been at exeter uni and recently graduated. One night after being very drunk last summer, I stayed at his and fell asleep in his bed after saying I was too tired to have sex. I woke up about 30 minutes later to him assaulting me but was too frightened to say something at the moment, I waited till he fell asleep and left his house. I confronted him about it to which his only real response was it was ""sad our 'friendship' had soured because of it"".",,
"I was sexually abused by a boy I had a really good bond with when we were friends, in year nine I was blackmailed into sending nude photos because I was being threatened and bullied by him to do so. It was stupid of me to do but I thought it would make him like me as I was so young I didn’t know what I was doing was wrong. He then screenshotted the photo and posted it on social media and I was then bullied continuously everywhere I went, I moved to a different school and everyone had seen the photos. I would walk through different areas of the city and have people shout at me from bus windows and people who were walking past me (these were people I didn’t even know) me being young and dumb I forgave him multiple times because I really wanted him to like me and I thought he did but there was another time when I was at a party and I asked him if he would walk me home because it was dark and my friends had already left we were about 15 minutes into walking home and we had to walk through a park to get home because we lived near eachother. I went to sit down in a shelter on the park because I felt sick and was blacking out due to drinking. It was then he was bending me over and I kept telling him no and he wouldn’t stop until I managed to get the strength to push him off of me that he stopped. Then he walked off without me and left me alone late at night in the pitch black to walk home alone in a vulnerable situation. Luckily I made it home safe and went straight to bed. When we first because friends in year seven when I was 11/12 he would always put his arm around me and touch my chest area constantly and he would do this to multiple girls who would say they were uncomfortable but he wouldn’t stop. Sometimes he would brag about these situations and all his friends would laugh and agree with him. He was reported to the school a number of times and nothing was done. I was told that the school had made a compilation of clips of him sexually harassing girls that lasted up to 10 minutes long. When the photo was sent out the police gave him a caution. Many girls have reached out to me because I spoke up about this and have said they have had similar situations happen with the same person and other students in the friend group. Somebody was sexually assaulted in an isolation booth at the school by the same boy who assaulted me, he had managed to do this and get away with it because there were no teachers in the room at the time and no CCTV was placed in the isolation room.",,
"My friend and I were groped in the lunch line when we were 14. I had just started at the school and I had already heard things about up-skirting which scared me as it had happened to girls in my year - the perpetrators were given a very light punishment and the school didn't deal with it too well. This boy who groped us in the lunchline (he wasn't a perpetrator of the up-skirting) would continually make comments like 'if I help you with the work you have to give me head' and spread lies about girls who he supposedly 'gotten with' when they rejected him. He gas-lit my friend when she didn't want to get with him / send nudes and said she was stupid and ugly for not wanting to get with him. He made all the girls feel uncomfortable. I sat next to him when I first joined the school and he always made inappropriate comments that I didn't know how to respond to. When Everyones Invited first kicked off around March/April, our year level really started to have conversations about stuff that had happened in our school (a lot of stuff worse than that , but this was so normalised ). He pretended to really be on board like he had done nothing wrong. Like it was some trend that would go away - he never learnt from what we tried to call out and educate the boys about; a lot of them fell back to their old ways. He continued to act like that.",,
the boys and girls toilets in my comp we're joined. i was drying my hands and this boy i liked was there as well and he said if i didn't suck his dick he wouldn't speak to me or see me again. i was in year 8.,,
"i was TWELVE walking home from my first term of high school when i was severely sexually assaulted on the main road by a sixteen year old boy from another school. people walked by and did nothing, people drove by and did nothing. when i went to his school with my parents, we identified the boy and the police got involved. one of the first questions i was asked was “but what were you wearing?” I WAS A CHILD. i was in my school uniform. i dropped the charges and i still live with the trauma to this day. why did it matter what i was wearing?",,
I was walking in a park and a group of boys on the swing shouted nice arse and asked for my snapchat,,
"My ex boyfriend took advantage of how nervous I was , trust me I was exremerly nervous and he knew that, and he thought that me saying maybe was a good enough answer and he did it anyways. He knows he shouldn't have done it because when I brought it up he panicked and felt bad, he knows what he did was wrong. It's took me two years to come to terms with this.",,
I was at a local scouting explorer group. I was raped by my then boyfriend at one of the camps. I tried to report it and instead was just sent home and banned from camps for having sex. This year is 10 years since the event. He was allowed to continue scouting with me and actually went on to become a scout leader. I tried to report it higher and higher this year and instead they simply told me I wasn't fit to be a scout leader anymore,,
i was at a family dinner but left to see my friends at the park. one minute i was sitting down. the next he was on top of me as i screamed no. he told me it never happened and i was drunk. the rape kit said otherwise..,,
"After a party I decided to share a cab home with one of my guy friends but he ended up just coming to my house, this wasn’t uncommon and I frequently let guys and girls crash at mine. I set him up in the spare room and we were chatting on the bed. We started kissing but I quickly realised I didn’t want it to go any further, and kept saying ‘stop, this is weird, we’re just friends’. He pulled down my pajama shorts and started having sex with me. I was shocked and just kept saying stop this is so weird, shoved him off me a left the room. I cried myself to sleep. The next morning I didn’t know what to do and pretended everything was fine until he left, and then sat in the shower for an hour cause I felt so disgusting. I was so embarrassed and didn’t tell any of my friends for ages as he had a girlfriend. It took me over a year to register that just because it wasn’t violent didn’t mean it wasn’t rape.",,
"I was at a public swimming pool and a boy i knew was inappropriately touching me without my consent. I was calling for help and no one, not even the life guards, came to help me at first",,
"I was at a school party in a club. I was staying at a friend's house. I knee everyone at the party as we all went to school together. A frond whom I fancied came over and we kissed. He led me outside to carry on. I was enjoying it and couldn't believe it was happening. Then it got heavy. He pushed my head on to his penis I got out then he grabbed me and put his hand in my.knickers and pushed his fist inside me. I'm not entirely sure what happened next but he left me, I was bleeding and in shock. I went to the loo to sort myself out and went to find friends. I darent tell them to begin with. I told them the next day as I was still bleeding. I spoke to the female deputy head who knew who it was before I said. Apparently he's done similar things before. Nothing happened. He wasn't spoken to as far as I was aware. I didn't tell my mum, I left school and didn't tell anyone.",,
"I was at a party with my so called group of friends. 5 or 6 lads, 1 girl (dating one of the guys). Our group wasn’t hyper sexual or wild - we were the studious ones who went on to get top in class and become doctors. Sexual humour was always the de facto go to and fall back, and I was picked on - not maliciously, but I was naive, and they took great pleasure in trying to shock me. At this party, things got out of hand - they pinned me down to the floor, and one of them took out his penis and “windmilled” it round in my face. I felt terrified and sick and couldn’t breathe. I initially had a cushion over my face because he was trying to slap my face with his penis, so I dug the cushion further into my nose and mouth. It seemed to go on forever.,I’ve never told anyone this. I was so embarrassed. Afterwards I felt I needed to laugh it off or else they’d call me out even more a prude and joke on and on. And I haven’t really thought about it too much - I quickly stopped seeing this group of people once I left school and it saddens me that this kind of thing passes for party amusement.",,
I was 14 and was sexually assaulted by someone in the year above me. People in my school knew and majority did nothing and treated it like gossip.,,
"when I was 14 my boyfriend at the time were sleeping in a room full of people after a party. He attempted to have anal sex with me without consent or any warning. I told him to stop and he eventually did, he didn’t apologise and we never spoke about it again. I felt embarrassed that it even happened and that I had to tell him to stop. I haven’t ever really come to terms with it as what it was because it never seemed like a big deal to him at all- not important enough to even ask about or speak about after. This is why consent needs to be taught about PROPERLY AND IN DEPTH. Not by watching a 2 minute video about tea.",,
"Where do I begin. There have been so many seemingly minor instances of sexual harassment and abuse over the course of my life as a woman but there is one time in particular where I was raped while abroad. I was with a friend and they knew some guys from back home who were also on holiday so we decided to meet up with them at a bar. We had got quite drunk beforehand and they persuaded us to join them back at their hotel. I’m not a big drinker but they carried on supplying us with alcohol, even pouring straight vodka down my throat. I was so intoxicated that I didn’t realise one of the guys had taken me into the bathroom and had undressed me and was raping me. When I came into consciousness of what was going on I was confused as I didn’t remember consenting to this but I allowed him to carry on and actually forced myself to accept it. My mind literally said, ’well it’s already happening so I suppose I better pretend to enjoy it and get it over with quickly’. My mind left my body so that I didn’t have to think about what was going on. I went to sleep and I later found out he proceeded to have sex with my friend whilst I was on the bed. He didn’t use protection and we both contracted an STD from him.,I always found this example very confusing and didn’t call it rape for a long time afterwards because I thought I had been okay with it even though it had felt so wrong. The reality was I never wanted to sleep with him at any moment that night, he had been flirting with my friend all night so I wouldn’t have done that to her, but he ended up assaulting me anyway. I’m now finally able to realise that it was rape, not only that but it ended up ruining and ending the long friendship I had with my friend.,I want to share this for all the other victims that have experienced some form of assault but the lines were blurred and you didn’t understand what consent was, or weren’t able to give it at the time. Your experience is no less real or traumatic, whether people believe you or not.",,
"I was 11 at a public outdoor swimming pool, before we got to the entrance a 14/15 year old boy told us he was new to the area and asked if he could hang with our family for the day. After a while of normal playing he swam with me to the shallow end and exposed himself to me, he asked if he could touch my area under my swimsuit and I said no. He convinced me it was normal at his age and I’d just be getting ahead of the game. I believed him, he was rough and I had to stop myself screaming as this was all happening while still in public but underwater. He attempted to take me into the men’s changing rooms but I said I wasn’t allowed as I was a girl. I believe I unknowingly saved myself from being raped in those changing rooms.",,
There was a boy in the year below me at primary school who required additional support. He had a TA that would be with him during class and during break and lunch on the field and playground. I remember when I was in year two me and some friends walked past him and he was getting agitated about something. He ran up to us and threw himself on the ground and was grabbing hold of our legs to stop us walking away. The TA just stood there telling him that he should stop as we were trying to leave but she didn’t intervene more than this. When he grabbed my legs he put his had up my skirt and touched me. She saw him do this and did nothing. I know she saw because my friends said something about it after we were able to leave so there is no way she also wouldn’t have. I knew it was wrong because I was also being sexually abused by a relative but didn’t quite grasp at the time what about all these situations was making them feel so wrong as I didn’t understand and if an adult had seen and done nothing was it actually as wrong as I felt it was?,,
"In my early twenties I found myself the only person left on a night bus and when I rang thd bell for my stop, the bus driver refused to stop and let me get off. He drove the bus down into a dark bus depot and would not open the doors. At this point, I felt my best option was to be friendly to the driver. He eventually opened the doors and I ran away as fast as I could. I never reported it.",,
"Constantly, girls have been taught to control their skirt length not even due to the actual boys but the male stuff in our school. Male stuff have even admitted to the reason we are not allowed to wear leggings is because of the ‘distraction’ they cause.",,
"It happened in the bathroom when i was seven. I didn't know what had happened because we weren't ever educated on sex between the same sex. I had to grow up till now slowly finding out what it is that caused me pain. Now i can't find anything but disgust toward myself. I could have screamed, but i sort of froze. I barely remember it, but i remember being in pain and i still have all the trauma. I haven't told anyone except two friends. My parents don't know why i suffered multiple panic attacks on a daily basis in my old school or why i hurt myself for years. They think i'm dramatising my life. Maybe i am. I don't want them to know. I have no proof of it. I just want to forget it forever. I never even knew the girls name and i only really noticed her once before. Her face is blurry to me now. I just remember she'd say quite a few lewd things to me before.Part of the reason why i don't want people to know is because i am lesbian, and i don't want people to think that that happening with a girl is what affected that. There are idiots out there who would think that. I knew before it, all that experience did was make me scared of people and talking to them. I've been terrified to write this, the school isn't on the list. I feel so guilty for doing this. I really am sorry but my close friend that i trust and respect completely told me it would be refreshing and even if it sounds selfish, it already is refreshing. I'm sorry.",,
"I was 10/11 years old when I was sexually assaulted by my cousin. I didn't know what he was doing at the time, so I let it happen. I knew it was wrong, but didn't have the courage to stop it because I had known and trusted him my whole life. He repeatedly assaulted me every time I saw him, by using a game we played to get me alone and grab my waist, boobs, butt and would direct my face to his penis. By the time I had realised what was happening, I blamed myself for not seeing it before and didn't tell anyone because I didn't want to break up my family over something stupid. After the initial shock of it, and realising what was happening, I started getting panic attacks whenever I had to sit next to a man and eventually fell into a depression, not knowing I was in one. No one knew what was happening, and I didn't want to worry anyone with what I was going through, so I told myself it wasn't serious and that at least he didn't rape me. One time, I had a panic attack in the middle of class and was on the verge of breaking so I asked to go to the toilet and the teacher didn't let me go. I didn't want to tell her I was panicking, and I made sure to not cry, but I remember giving myself away with my voice, but she still didn't let me go. I had to sit in class for the rest on the lesson trying to steady my breathing but it didn't do anything because I couldn't get away from the sound of someone hitting their pen on the desk. I eventually tried giving out small cries of help through my work and behavior, but no one noticed because I was overlooked as just being the quiet/shy one. After I knew no one could help me, I forced myself to get better on my own and starting resisting to him and he eventually stopped after pushing his hands off of me and kicking him away. I was only in year 7 at the time and I didn't know the extent of what happened until it was over, and still took another couple years before feeling completely like myself again.",,
"me along with several other girls were sexually assaulted by a male student at our attending school, after several reports of it, admission finally took action, however the action was very minimal, the male student was suspended for three days and no further action. I personally feel as though this wasn’t enough as this was a meer game for him, and nothing was going to stop him.",,
"My experiences aren't as harrowing as many of these testimonies but I thought it would be worth showing how far back some of these things go and how schools themselves can perpetuate rape culture.,I was at secondary school in the 2000s and I attended [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], an all girl's school. We were subject to skirt checks, told we could only wear white or flesh coloured bras so teachers couldn't see them through the flimsy mandated school blouse. My year group fought for the right to have trousers in the uniform, this wasn't an option until I was 15. In sixth form we couldn't wear spaghetti strap tops because our bra straps would inflame the male staff - something many of our female staff derided as completely unreasonable but seemed unable to change.,Speaking of staff, there was a Physics teacher who'd been in the department forever and every year you'd hear new stories of him being inappropriate with girls: locking girls in the supply cupboard, telling sixth formers about him picking up sex workers, explains that the Science rooms had stools so he could see our underwear. I personally witnessed him commenting on the colour of a girl's knickers when she'd had to stand on a desk to drop a feather and a ball - her side zip was broken and held up with a safety pin and she was unfortunately at his eye height. He was uncommonly tall and would routinely block doorways and loom over girls. He left at the end of my GCSEs only to be brought back as an invigilator. When I took my A Levels , there was a clash between two of my exams. I had to take my second exam alone in a small enclosed space with him. I was hypervigilant but unfocused on my work the whole time. I got a C when I was predicted an A.,We had a talk from a local police officer in Year 9 on personal safety that amounted to being told don't drink or you'll get raped, don't get in a minicab or you'll get raped, don't wear a short skirt or you'll get raped. Real victim blaming bullshit.,Later, I was a TA at a local secondary school after university. As a TA I was subjected to sexual harrassment by the students I was there to support. One asked me if I used a dildo or if I'd suck him off. A group of them shoved a magnifying glass down the back of my trousers while I was scribing for one of them. What I wanted in both instances was for the school to put in place substantive courses to talk to these boys about consent and autonomy and harrassment. All they wanted to do was suspend or threaten them with the police - not do anything that would explain why what they had done was wrong, not provide me with support, not examine whether if they felt emboldened to do that to me, an adult, how they were treating their peers.,I'm now a teacher and it is heartbreaking but sadly not surprising to read these testimonies and see how schools are at best ill equipped and at worst actively protecting and promulgating abusive, violating behaviour. It's not my story to tell but I will never forget how badly my last school let down a survivor in my tutor group by facilitating the breaking of a protection order.,Solidarity to all of you making your testimonies; I am so sorry for those of you who are suffering not just from the behaviour of your peers but the inaction of your institutions.",,
A boy stuck his fingers inside of me whenever I told him not to. Nobody believed me. It’s hurts to talk about. I was in 7th grade I still have to go to school with him to this day. If I tell anyone I thought nobody would believe me.,,
"I was on holiday with a school friend, both our older brothers and their friends. I was 14 and he was 16. I was very drunk and sleeping on the sofa in my bikini after a fun night of drinking, swimming in the pool and just having fun. He was sleeping next to me, and reached around and groped my boobs. He eventually stopped but then I woke up later to my hand wrapped around his dick, I quickly moved it away and tried to go back asleep. He’s still friends with my brother now and I’ve never told my brother.",,
i was raped.,,
Grabbed my butt while telling me I was doing a good job on biology,,
"I was harassed for years by boys in my school. They were a foot taller and a lot stronger than me, surrounding me when I was on my own and making disgusting comments and laughing. They talked about my sexuality, my body, how easy I was, and later spoke about how trans people shouldn't be allowed to vote, corrective rape, and other things. They laughed at my discomfort,This was at the same time as me being in a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship. I was isolated from everyone, incredibly mentally ill, and being raped regularly, but I had to come in to school every day and listen to them make rape jokes. If I got upset I was a ""snowflake"" and ""triggered"", so I couldn't speak out about my pain.",,
I was pretty pressured into doing things i didn’t want to do. ir was so hard to say no because I hated disappointing him but i would cry for hours everytime after it was over.,,
"I had just came out of a club from the centre of my campus, me and my friend were approached and surrounded by grown men asking about us and catcalling us - I tried to leave and they stopped me from leaving! After 5 minutes of being scared for my life I attempted to leave again, one of them turned round and tried to grab my arm to pull me back in but ended up hitting my boob. They laughed as I walked off and I felt so scared that they would follow me to the car.",,
Boys in my school would have bets to see how many girls they could sleep with and pass around in a year...,,
I myself and other girls i know have been called sluts and slags for things they wear and how they act. I’ve heard girls 13/14 get called “big jugs” because of her bigger breasts and i have witnessed others being inappropriately touched. this is just my year group of 13-14 year olds.,,
"I recently visited my boyfriend of 3 ish years at his uni house in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Over the week there were literally two times where i wasn’t with him and both times I was harrassed by older men. The first time, I was taking the trolley back to the front of aldi when this middle aged guy came over and tried to talk to me, i ignored him then he proceeded saying “you’re quite petite if you don’t mind me saying” why tf do you feel like you can say that?! The second time I was walking through town to meet my boyfriend after work and some guy tried chatting to me and complimented me, i ended up being late to meeting my bf because i had to wait for traffic to die down to cross the street bc i didn’t feel comfortable staying on that side of the road. Guys don’t understand that whenever something ‘little’ like this happens, we don’t know if its ‘just another sexual harrasment experience’ or if it’ll end up with rape and/or murder.",,
"It was my first week at the new school, there was many new students, in one of my classes i was sat next to guy, we instantly hit as good friends. I suppose he got extremely comfortable and decided to put his hand on my thighs, i got startled and soon told him it made me uncomfortable, he took his hands off and about 5-10 minutes later, he wrapped his hand around my waste and touched my breasts, i wanted to scream at the very moment but nothing came out, things kept moving and i wasn’t able to open my mouth i was so shocked and terrified that he’d do something to me if i opened my mouth, soon he ended up touching my butt as well, and that’s where i hit his hand. He knew what i was signaling him to do, he told me to not tell anyone or he’d get one of his “girl” friends on me. I’ve yet to tell ANYONE, cause i’m so afraid that i’d get judged .",,
"It was a club night. I was having the best night out of my life. There was this guy who I'd spoken to a few times and we had flirted etc. My friends went home and I hung around for him to walk me home. Next thing I knew I was in the gender neutral toilet being made to perform sexual acts for him and zoned out for what felt like forever. I eventually realised what was going on and removed myself from the situation and called one of my friends who I'd been out with and explained what happened, my friend (male) and 2 of his friends met me, walked me home and made sure I was okay, my friend accompanied me to report the incident at 5am in the morning and for that I am extremely thankful. Unfortunately I worked at the club and the offender still showed up on my shifts trying to play it off like it was nothing. The offender also blamed me after for giving him a STI (I hadn't) and told a different story that was spread around. I chose not to take the case further as there was the devastating media coverage of the girl who's underwear was shown in court at the same time and I didn't want to go through that.",,
"i was 15 . I was in secondary school and at lunch so we were in quite a crowded corridor. There were a couple of boys behind me. One of the boys touched my bum/ upper thighs (presumably by accident). This made me uncomfortable, but what really made me feel unsafe was when the other boys saw what had happened and began to make creepy and sexual comments about me and my body.",,
So it’s kind of simple but it was still very uncomfortable to me. I was in about 3rd grade and this boy in my class had been my rival the whole year. We would like glare each other down and stuff like that. But one day at lunch I was sitting with my friend and he came up behind me and pinched my butt very hard. I jumped up and yelped and the whole table laughed. And although this was quite simple and we were both very young I feel that if I was old enough to remember he was old enough to understand his actions.,,
"I was 15 and at an end of year party at a friends house where a guy who sat next to me in most of my lessons got on top of me (we were on the sofa) and was poking my sides really hard (""tasing me""). This initially started as a joke but it was really painful and I told him to stop multiple times but then he started feeling my boobs from the side. I couldn't believe this was happening as there were people around and I thought I knew him pretty well. Others were laughing and did not tell him to stop even when I started crying. I then had to act as if I was unwell to cover up my tears and finally get him off me. I couldn't put my own arms around myself for months after since I had bruises there (they were blue and I have brown skin so it's hard to see bruising in the first place) and it reminded me of what happened. I didn't even feel comfortable telling friends what happened since it pales in comparison to the stuff they have dealt with. A friend of mine at the party comforted me after saying that she knew something was wrong. Please speak up when you see something unacceptable since it's the only way of seeing any change.",,
At the age of 15 I was forced into sex by my then boyfriend who took my virginity. He was overpowering and got what he wanted and if I said no he was threaten to hurt me. Throughout the 2 years of my relationship I was forced multiple times into sexual acts that I did not want to participate in all to please my ex because of the threats I would face. I am now 20 and to this day he has gone on to do the same thing to other girls in which I have found out about. These experiences have traumatised me and made it hard for me to even get to know another man as I am afraid of the possible pain I could go through,,
Sexually touch multiple times in hallways bathrooms and classes,,
idk if this is exactly what your looking for but I was on the tube and there was a man asking for money. I always feel bad when they get ignored so I gave him some change and in response he leant on me and started kissing me. I should have clocked he wasn’t sober and wasn’t someone I should have interacted with but I was 14 and didn’t know better. He must have been at least 40 and just laughed when I tried to push him away- the whole experience made me really scared of going on the tube for months afterwards,,
"there’s this teacher at my middle school keep in mind I just graduated 8th grade a week ago I didn’t do online classes but I did go in person a few times . I went because I needed to do staar test . My advocacy teacher well call him mr . T , he was a very good teacher, he was fun I admit but when I went to school the 3rd time he kept looking at me and staring it made me very uncomfortable…. On the last day he hugged me cause u wasn’t going to go to school no more and he was holding me really tight and wouldn’t let me go … it made me uncomfortable I wouldn’t say he assaulted me but I was uncomfortable at the time ..",,
"I was in a relationship with a guy. I lived with him for 2 years. He was mentally, emotionally and physically abusive and translated this all when it came to sex. If I said no, which in itself is a valid enough reason, but I would also come up with excuses such as not feeling well or being tired - he saw his status as ‘being my boyfriend’ as enough consent to ignore what I said and just flip me over anyway. I’d spend nights sleeping in the spare room to avoid this, but he just saw that as me needing to owe him more of my time.",,
A boy grabbed my ass without consent and has happened to multiple other girls in our year nothing has been done I was also told that I would be raped and nothing has been done.,,
"was touched inappropriately during a movie time, the teacher didn’t even care because he was a well known kid :/",,
"I was 15, and had sex for the first time with this guy in the year above. I was inexperienced so trusted him to treat me well with it as he had sex lots of times before. before we had sex he told me to close my eyes so i did what he said. little did i know he was taking pictures of me in sex positions and when i said wtf why are you taking pictures of me he told me they were for his eyes only for later when i wasn’t there. i said i wasn’t comfortable with them and he said stfu be quiet and flipped me on my stomach. we had sex then but half way through when i was already in a panicked state from the unconsented pictures i said stop it hurts too much and he said haha that’s what i like, and i said no i’m not joking stop right now and he pushed me forward and continued to fuck me. i said i needed the bathroom after but in reality i locked myself in there and cried for 15 mins shaking, feeling taken advantage of, with the sense that is this what sex is all about. it wasn’t until months later when i realised how wrong this situation was but i still felt worthless and vulnerable.",,
A year 13 boy groped me when I was in year 7 and waking home.,,
"I am a 19 year old mixed race singer that grew up in a very white conservative environment where I was often degraded and made to feel insecure. My first few sexual experiences were with racist male peers that wanted to ‘try a back a black girl”. I was so insecure I simply didn’t think anyone would treat me better, so I believed I had to have sex with them otherwise another opportunity might never come again and I’d be, god forbid - a virgin forever! It makes me cringe and feel so sad looking back that I valued myself so low. They should never have had access to my body or myself. The first 3 times I had sex, the male’s took off the condom without my consent during the sex, even though I had made it completely clear they needed to use protection as I was not on any pill etc. This resulted in me having to get the morning after pill with my mum, mortifyingly, after losing my virginity at age 16. I never said anything to them when I realised they had removed it, and I didn’t ask for it to stop as I feared they would spread embarrassing information about me if I was difficult towards them, such as how I was a fuller figure then (size 10/12 which I believed was huge then sadly.) I believe this is a form of sexual harassment or assault, which I now realise, called ghosting. I just wanted to share my experience .",,
[date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I was with a few mates and was wearing shorts and a normal t-shirt as I’m not confident in myself at all it was all normal we were laughing having a few drinks and then eventually separated we all walked away in separate groups but after everyone went off it just me and a boy who I thought was my friend so we continued drinking and just having a normal conversation and then it all went wrong he started touching me on my inner thought pressing himself against me and kissing my neck I told him I didn’t want it and walked away and then he said it’s not bad you can trust me so I said no and walked away again he then grabbed me by my hand and pulled me to him and started touching me inappropriately I didn’t want it I tried my hardest to pull away and tried walking again I tried calling my friends but their phone was off he then got hold of me again and tried to do inappropriate sexual acts on me which I didn’t want he was forcing me to do it saying do it or your frigid do it or I’m gonna tell everyone your a slag and cause shit I tried running away from him and he found me again and pushed me over and started to grind on me I started crying I didn’t want it I didn’t want him he wouldn’t let me go he was grabbing me by the neck calling me names and pressing up against me eventually everyone came back and asked what happened as they saw me crying and he denied everything and got away with it it still lives me ever since I next saw him a few weeks later abd he was telling w wry one I’m frigid I don’t know what I’m doing and thst I’m a whore but I just carried on walking and then they followed me again so I called my mate and hid till they were gone,,
"This is my third testimony on here. I was dating a guy on and off. He didn't treat me particularly well, but I was young and stupid with low self esteem . Once we had sex and it hurt, and I asked him to stop, stop it hurts! And he didn't until he was finished. It was years and years later when I realised that that was rape.",,
"When I was around 15 I had this guy I really fancied. We used to text everyday and I had the feeling that he also liked me. He always used to make comments about my body which at the time I thought was just flirting. One day he asked me for nudes. I was kinda hesitant but he kept pushing. I sent some in the end because I thought that it would make him like me. After that the only interaction on text we would have was about nudes. This went on for around a year. I felt so ashamed and disgusted by myself. I always felt that it was my fault and my fault only...,I continued to send them because I thought that it would someday lead to a relationship.,I went to school always worried that they would get leaked or added to the shared file of nudes the boys had in my year. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it because there was so much backlash against sending nudes (especially if you’re a girl). I felt horrible because I also shamed other girls for sending nudes...,I finally stopped sending them once I found out that he had done the same thing to many other girls in my year. I stopped blaming myself as well, but it took me 2 years to finally tell someone.",,
"I was at a party and i had quite a lot to drink, this boy started groping me whilst i was dancing so i moved away, then he found me again later and picked me up and layed me down on this trampoline that was in the garden. He started to try and forcefully finger me under my dress and i kept telling him to get off me and stop but he wouldn’t. i had to physically push him off with all my strength even though i was not nearly as strong as him.",,
"I went to this party after work in my shirt and trousers, eventually said hi to everyone and my close friend at the time was very tactile, always liked a hug. But this time it was very uncomfortable and when I was trying to get past him he would block my way, I stood backwards he’d step forwards and so on. He grabbed my by my arm and started unbuttoning my shirt and copped a feel of my boobs. I was horrified. I kept saying for him to stop and he’d just giggle and told me to ‘just live a little’. After that I’d avoided him at school and tried to stay away from him as much as possible. On a separate occasion he’d pinned me to the floor IN SCHOOL in front of people and nobody done anything, people just watched. I later found out that he’d done much worse things to other girls and I’d had enough. I told the school I went to at the time, they simply ignored me and the other girls that had been affected by letting him come to school everyday. Do you know how difficult it was for us all to see him everyday while we struggled to come to terms with what he did? It was awful. It later went to court, me and 5/6 other girls stood in the stand and told our stories. All the cases that he’d been charged with were found ‘not proven guilty’ by the jury and id honestly never felt so let down in my life",,
"I had only met this guy once before but he was friends with a lot of my friends so I felt like I could trust him, I remember he was so persistent with buying me drink and I didn’t think anything of it at first but the day after I met him I had little memory of the night and was covered in bruises which I still have scars from now, when I messaged him after asking if he knew what had happened he said he didn’t know and laughed so I assumed it was just because I was drunk. I met him again a few weeks later in a park near his house and this time drank a lot more, my memory is so blurred from that night but what I do remember is the pain, not just emotional but physical too, the way he pinned me down and I tried shouting but it almost didn’t come out. I’ve never felt weak but in that moment I was completely helpless. Straight after he tried apologising and I was just so confused I knew something had happend but I didn’t understand what until much later when I came to terms with it. It’s still such a scary thought for me and what maybe was just a normal night for him is a moment I replay in my head nearly everyday.",,
"I was 19 and he was 26, I met him while working and really fancied him, I thought he had good morals because he defended me at work when I was getting sexually harassed. Then one day we were in a public building in the evening, and we started kissing and I initially consented to us having sex, but when it began he completely changed. He was violent, and used me, I kept telling him to slow down but when I realised he was ignoring me I froze, he kept pulling my cheeks so far apart that my vulva ripped. I felt relieved when he said he pulled out, but realised he wasn’t finished. I didn’t want him inside me again so I knelt down and then he forced himself down my throat, I couldn’t breathe and began to choke. By the end I stood up and realised I was bleeding and bruised. He said he had the best time. I got upset and he blamed me and said I asked for it. My family and friends believed me when I told them, but unfortunately I live in a small town so I’m at risk of seeing him everyday and we have mutual friends. I still blame myself for not fighting him off.",,
"My friend dated this dude I never like him but after they broke up we found out that he had actually raped a 12 year old girl (he was 14-15) after finding out we cut of complete contact he then proceeded to stalk and harass her after a couple of weeks he gave up tho he was able to somehow get hold of my number he then started do the same to me telling me he was “gonna rape me in a park if I didn’t send him my ass” I told him I was gay but It continued and got worse. After a while I died down and stopped tho I Again later found out while he stopped harassing me he when on to do something similar to another girl but actually ended up raping her, the first time I told the school they did nothing the only time they did something was after he committed rape",,
"me and my friend were drunk sitting with older boys ( he is 18 and i’m 15) and he started fingering me but i was way more drunk than him and he knew that, i wasn’t in any way in the right mind to say stop but i was trying to move and it was very clear i was uncomfortable with the situation.",,
"when i was in year six, this boy had a crush on me. he wouldn't accept that i didn't like him, and him plus all of his friends would holler at me, or make sexual jokes about us two. i was stood behind him, facing back to back as he was sitting at his table and i was sorting out the pencils. he turned around and used a ruler to lift up my skirt. then he called his friend over and whispered to him and they started laughing.",,
"Not as bad as the other stories, and I hate that I have to say that but a guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was once really forceful with me, treated me like a piece of meat. I woke up to him touching me without consent and since have felt uncomfortable and violated. He has also been accused of sexual assault on numerous occasions but no one seems to care.",,

"Working in a [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] as a bartender, pressured into having a drink with an older man after work who grabbed my breasts infront of everyone when I stretched. Caught on security camera, seen by barstaff and customers. Noone said anything about it and he was allowed to stay. Also had someone keep coming back and following me around at work never taking no for an answer and getting progressively more agressive and insistent everytime i said no.",,
"I was 10, and this boy had a crush on me. He was new, but I liked another boy, and that boy liked me back, so we started ""dating"". Well, the new kid didn't get the message. So, everyday, in maths he would touch me under the table. I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all and I would tell him to stop but he wouldnt listen. Once he put his hand up my skirt, or touch me above it, all while the teacher sat at her desk, completely unaware of the situation. And I didn't tell her. I didn't tell anyone. When we were in different subjects he would stare at me across the room and mouth then words "" I love you"". I hated it. And no one knew.",,
"The other day at school some stranger informed me that I ""have a hairy bush"", presumably meaning my vulva isn't shaven. It's so intrusive, and is such a clear way of trying to get power. They said it in a loud sing-song voice, in front of loads of people, so clearly meant to get attention, and embarrass and control me.",,
"When I was 17 in a club underage I bumped into a much older, much bigger guy I knew through sport. He bought me a drink and we kissed. As we were kissing in a corridor near a group of my mates, he kept trying to reach into my underwear. This was in full view of my mates who were pointing and laughing. I kept trying to pull his hands away but didn’t want to make a big deal of it in an attempt to seem ‘grown up’. He was much stronger than me . He was the first person to put his fingers inside me and all of my mates saw. They all found it hilarious.",,
"When I was 16 (I am now 19) I was celebrating the end of GCSEs and got so drunk that I threw up from drinking for the first time ever. A boy I considered a friend carried me to the bathroom stripped me to my underwear and put me in the bath. I then threw up on myself again and remember my head slipping down into the water. The next flash I remember is him carrying me into a spare room taking off my clothes, getting on top of me spreading my legs whilst the whole room span around me. I was too sick to move and remember him pushing himself inside me saying “fuck it’s so tight”. Remember him pushing my body into lots of weird positions headi n the pillows with no control. Woke up confused why i was naked why my vagina hurt. I was a virgin - he never admitted it I didn’t realise I got raped until at least a year later. I now struggle to have sex with my boyfriend and often disconnect from my body have vivid flash backs and on the whole can’t connect to sex",,
"I was 13 at a party, blackout drunk and unable to speak or register anything going on around me when two guys began taking advantage of my state. They passed me around, feeling me up and groping me before I slowly began to regain consciousness and realise that they had started fingering me, I’m not sure for how long, though they were unaware at this point that I was conscious and knew very well that there was no consent.",,
"I kissed a guy in a club and at closing time he said his halls were near where I was staying (I was house sitting an empty place) so we could walk back together. He then said he had lost his key so could he come in and sell on my sofa. Naively, I let him. I got us drinks downstairs but he immediately picked me up and carried me upstairs looking for a bedroom. I tried to hang on to doors etc but he was strong. He pinned me down and forced oral sex on me. The next few hours are blurry but he managed to penetrate me at one point. I managed to lock myself in the bathroom later. He apologised and went to sleep, then left the next morning.",,
"I joined a very well known school in the north of England in 1993. There were 12 girls in my year and about 150 boys. As we arrived for interview, we were marked out of 10. To my knowledge, there was no sexual violence, but girls were encouraged to behave in an unladylike manner. If one had not got a boyfriend one was frigid. The idea was to kiss a “quota” of boys through the time there. There were regular skirt lifting exercises. There were rumours that many of us did not wear knickers to school. The girls were regarded and treated as less intelligent. All very difficult to pin down and very much was inferred rather than said, but it was deeply sexist. There was no pastoral care. It gave many of us a lack of confidence to say “no” so we just went along with it. I have a daughter. I NEVER want her to feel as though she can’t say NO!",,
"""As a girl at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], it was so normal to see a girl's worth be defined by their attractiveness/sexual activity that I hardly questioned it. Looking back, it was really twisted - all sorts of """"fuckable"""" rankings, ratings, and lewd comments tossed around. It's worth noting that this was not only from the Sixth Form boys, but also from younger years too, I even remember being called a """"filthy slut"""" by a boy who looked like he was in year 7/8 on my way to Biology, while all his friends laughed. Even if it was just a dare, it's clear to me now that this kind of humour was symptomatic of a misogyny-normalising culture.,At [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I was sexually assaulted by a boy in my year, and I kept it a secret. I think the biggest reason for my silence was a lack of education. I didn't know what """"sexual coercion"""" was, and I had this idea that if the incident didn't involve the stereotypical elements of violence and a back alley, then it wasn't sexual assault. As a result, I blamed myself. I blamed myself even though he encouraged me to drink, and he waited until I was almost black-out drunk, and took me to an isolated park where I felt vulnerable, and pressured me. I told myself I should have protected myself better, I should have guessed his intentions, I should have drunk less. I wanted to pretend it never happened, meanwhile all the blame and trauma ate me up from the inside for years, and I'm still battling it.,A question that haunts me is """"what if he genuinely thought that my timid compliance counted as consent?"""". I doubt it, but I can't dismiss the possibility.,All of this often leads me to wonder how different life would be for myself and countless other victims if proper education about rape and consent was given to teenagers.""",,
"I was on the tube comming home late, a significantly older man in a dirty tracksuit kept touching himself whilst looking at me, he proceeded to ask questions about if I was alright and how old I am and that I shouldn’t be comming home this late, he comes closer and brushes his leg in front of my face and asks if I give head, continuing to touch himself further, I was about to start crying but didn’t want to seem weaker, so I stood up, cussed him out and left the train, never in my life was I scared more, i cried the journey home, when I told my mum, she just said that men are like that and there’s creeps everywhere and next time not to wear shorts, THIS CANNOT BE NORMALISED",,
In year 7 I was sexually assaulted on the way home from school by two boys that I was friends with. I was playing games on my phone at the time and the two boys kept trying to get me to pay attention to them. One of them said if you don’t pay attention to me I will touch your boobs. They both proceed to do that,,
"When I was 14 I had a few drinks and ended up getting quite drunk. My friend helped me upstairs to bed so I could sleep and I don’t know how long I was there for but when I woke up I was topless, I was still wearing a skirt but a boy, who had been a friend of mine for a couple of years, had his hands in between my legs and my knickers were down to my ankles. When my friends asked me about the night I told them what happened and they just said “oh he’s like that, he’s really touchy feely”. i had never had any experience with any boys before. None of the people that knew about it have ever mentioned it again and still remain friends with him.",,
"At my primary school, most boys in my class would constantly look up girls skirts and harass them about it. I sat next to one of them in class and he used to put his hand up my shorts and rub and touch me inappropriately (including my genitals), I never said anything about it because I didn’t even realise anything was wrong with him doing that to me (even though I was uncomfortable), my teachers never found out and as far as I know, no other people from my school have talked about it. It really affected me, even if I didn’t realise it, and I’ve recently began talking about my experiences with my therapist, I still feel as though it’s gone unheard and that it doesn’t really matter anymore because it’s been three years.",,
"it had happened earlier this year in 2021. [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. i had a best friend, he was a guy, and we were super close. but things got heated between us and we decided to stop being friends. and one day he had texted me and asked me if we could meet up in our school hallway, and i did thinking he wanted to talk abt being friends again. but when i got there he has started assaulting me. he had grabbed me by my throat and dragged me around yelling at me and calling me terrible names. so i eventually had gotten away, and went back to class. he texted me later ans told me he was sorry and asked me if we could meet in our spot, a spot where we would hang out. so i said yes, and after school i met him there. it was a small bathroom in a seminary building. and he had been waiting for me in a stall. and as soon as i got there he proceeded to hit me and push me up against the wall. he then proceeded to touch me against my will. he got bored of me and left. i had come out about it the next day because i knew i had to get a rape kit done or they wouldn’t catch him. i was in 8th grade. barely turned 14. he was a freshman. he got sent to live with a relative in florida and they dropped my case. i won’t ever get justice for what he did.",,
"I was groped multiple times by the same stranger the first night I went to a frat party in college. I didn't bother to report it because I didn't know who it was, and there wasn't really anything that could be done about it. I just hate how ingrained in our society things like that are, that we just accept them as a fact of life.",,
"This isn’t as shocking as some of the other ones, but it’s still worth a mention. There’s this guy who i was very close friends with for a few years, who always got away with a whole load of shit. He would comment on mine and my female friends’ bodies, making sexual jokes about us and at times even insulting how we looked, which had a very damaging effect. He would rate the whole friend group based on their features and assets, and would enjoy being generally misogynistic and sexist (he was also racist and xenophobic but that’s a whole other issue). He always got away with his shit because he was a good friend who had a certain charm about him. When he was drunk, it turned from ‘jokes’ to harassment. I remember we were at a party where he forced me into the bathroom and locked the door and tried to force himself upon me, getting upset when i refused to kiss him back. Also - he had a girlfriend at the time in the other room. When he got really drunk he would hug you and make it so you couldn’t escape. His favourite thing to do do his female friends while drunk was hug them so they couldn’t escape and kiss them down their neck. He would hug you so tightly whilst trying to kiss you, even when you were purely platonic and had no feelings on either side. I got so scared of him i refused hugs, even when he was sober, out of fear he would try and touch me up. Another time when he was drunk, he straight up shoved his hand down my friend’s top without consent, and up another girl’s skirt. I still get scared when i see him around, scared he will somehow make a comment about my body or try and feel me up",,
"I was “dating” (child version of dating aka holding hands) this guy when I was year 7 who had an unfortunately sexual last name. Guys in my class would consistently make lewd comments about it along with graphic hand gestures about what I could do to him, even going as far as printing out a picture of him and writing super perverted comments all over it and giving it to me in a lesson. It was horrible and even though at the time it was something I had to brush off it was mortifying, especially when you’ve just gotten to a new school. Oh yeah, and it was still bought up years later even when the relationship had ended.",,
"I woke up in the early hours of this morning, with a close friend of mine who I had been friends with for 4 years and hadn't seen in a while, with an arm and leg over me and grinding his penis into my back and butt. I froze, I wasn't sure what was going on, why he was doing it and then when he had realised I was awake he moved off me and whispered into my ear ""sorry about that"". I left the room in a panic and locked myself in the toilet whilst I woke up and realised what had just been happening. How does a friend think this is okay? Can he really be a friend if he does that? What else has he been doing whilst I've been asleep? Have I just properly experienced my first assault? I felt disgusted, my friend kicked him out and I've put all the bedding in the wash. I'm not okay, it's fucked up.",,

"I was barely 14 and was at the guy I liked’s house. I had only ever kissed boys before, and only known this boy for about 3 weeks. We were sat in his living room with a drinking games book, just reading the different games. He started going through the stripping/sex ones and pointing them saying ‘you’re too frigid for this’ ‘you’re too frigid for that’. At the time I didn’t even know what sexual harassment was, so I just was embarrassed and didn’t want him to think I was frigid. I sat there near tears and never mentioned it again. After 6 months of him making manipulative jokes and hints about sex or what other couples were doing compared to us, I lost my virginity to him on my 15th birthday week. I regret it so much, and still blame myself.",,
I and several other people were sexually assaulted multiple times by the same person over the course of our time there (which still continues through sexual harassment) and when I went to the principal he was only punished by a rest of the year suspension well I was told it was my fault for not saying no or hitting him when I physically removed his hand from my body multiple times.,,

As i lent over the desk, one of the loud boys from my class put his body close to my backside. Keeping in mind i would always wear my blazer that covered my backside, and wore trousers all throughout secondary i was violated like that. I couldn't bring myself to tell my friends what had happened for fear of being judged or being told to not lean over to grab paper like that. ,Another instance was in year 9 in my computing class another one of the loud boys from my year group kept touching my thigh as i was sat doing work and tried to grope my chest if i remember right. He definitely did continously touch my thigh in class. I told a close male friend in my class about it and he encouraged me to report him. I reported this to my head of year at the time and she took it very seriously. He wasn't allowed to do work experience at a nursery and i was given an option by my year lead to take this to the police. I chose not to for fear of harassment from the loud kids.""",,

"Too many of my friends (including myself) have been sexually assaulted, harassed or objectified by [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys. I dated a boy in the year above me from there when I was 16 and felt manipulated and coerced into doing a majority of things with him. He pressured me into having sex in the back of his car in a public car park which, after a lot of fighting back, I was able to argue my way out of. His response was that I was being ‘frigid’. As someone with a younger family member at the school I can already see his attitude towards girls his own age changing and that’s something really scary to watch. During my time at school I knew a lot of boys there who would encourage that sort of behaviour towards women and it’s made worse by the ‘lad culture’ and arrogant attitudes a majority seem to be supportive of. Change needs to come from within and it needs to be spearheaded by those in charge.",,
I was sexually abused by a 17 year old when I was eight. He touched me in my private parts and tried to touch himself while touching me and tried to kiss me.

I came to a boarding school to have a place to feel like home because at that time I didn’t feel safe or comfortable in my house but soon after I arrived it was like everyone had agreed that i was going to be the target of all their harassments. They would grab me if i walked past them and make disgusting comments and remarks. They would ask me out as a joke which completely destroyed what little self esteem i had and now if anyone says anything nice to or about me at all i just assume they are lying and secretly hate me. They would expose themselves and when I reported it again and again i was told that there was no proof and that they never do it around teachers so i am probably makjng it out to be more than it was. was ELEVEN when this started and the one chance i had to feel truly safe and protected for the first time that i can remember and now i feel terrified whenever i pass them in the halls three years later even though they have dialled it down i still find it hilarious how when we have talks about sexual assault i have to sit there and listen to them talk about how they would never want thaf to happen and how the thought of it disgusts them when they have not yet taken responsibility for their own actions.,,
"In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] (I was 13) i was sexually assaulted by this boy who grabbed my bum and tried to put his hand up my skirt multiple times and then boasted about it. I reported it to a few different teachers and my HOY and nothing happened. I decided to post it on my story and to spread awareness about sexual assault but i just got replies of abuse from boys saying that its “peak” to expose him. I even got told that i should’ve enjoyed it. The whole thing became a joke to boys in my year. Also, boys making sexual jokes to girls is too normalised its actually disgusting.",,
"I was at ASDA doing the daily shopping for my mum, and as I went to pick up something I had dropped a man appeared behind me. He repeated the words “Look at me”. Not thinking much since whenever I wear tight clothes men act like pigs, I just left feeling horribly uncomfortable. Existing ASDA he followed me. I just walked faster (he left his basket in ASDA without buying anything). Now I’m halfway near my house and the man stopped me again. I said “Leave me alone please, I don’t know what you want but I cannot help you” My heart was racing, I was terrified. Now I’m on my road and I kept looking back to make sure he’s gone and thinking I got the all clear I went to my house. Just as I was about to get my keys out he says “Hello, let me see you” He kept repeating it and he was staring at my legs (I tried hiding them with my shopping bag) by then I was crying and telling him “LEAVE ME ALONE, I don’t know you leave”. He told me he had seen me walk at times and that he lives around the corner (he didn’t) and asked me if that was my house I told him It was my cousin’s (lie) and that I’m 13. He then decided to leave apparently telling him to leave me alone and no isn’t enough. I couldn’t sleep, I had nightmares, I kept beating myself up because I didn’t take a picture of his face or go to someone, but I didn’t know he was going to stalk me or had stalked me before I even met him. I have been stalked all the way to my house at the age of only 13 and I’m terrified. Even now when I look back at it I want to cry. I wish I could tell the police but I’m scared they won’t do anything of it because it happened some months ago.",,
I was hanging out w one of my best guy friends and he had told me that if i didn’t do stuff w him he would tell everyone one of my secrets. i told him no and tried to walk away. and he forced himself on me. the cops did nothing about it.,,
i had sex with this guy once and was consensual but we were quite drunk so i don’t think it worked. Then other time i went to his house (completely sober this time). We were in his room kissing and doing stuff and i told him to put the condominium on. As it was my first time having sex it was super painful and I was saying that i didn’t want anymore and i didn’t like it. He took the condom off and when i told him to put it back on he refused. Fingering hurt the most and he was stronger than me and i kept trying to push him off but i was weak. And i started crying and shaking but he would stop penetrating me and he even said “ If you did it now it will be easier for next time.” He knew I was a virgin and he came in me and says “your on the pill right”. There was so much blood everywhere and i was in so much pain mentally and physically. A few days later he told me he might have STDs do i spent a lot of time in sex clinics but thankfully i didn’t have any. When i went to see my gyno she said there was a tiny rip (which must’ve been from him),,
A boy started massaging my shoulders I told him to stop and moved away yet he followed and continued. He stopped after a while but I wasn’t comfortable with it,,
"Last year I was out drinking and I went home with a guy he seemed nice, i slept with him, but the next morning i woke up to someone inside me, it was his mate who I’d never met, I managed to get him off me and ran out, i always blamed myself for getting to drunk but I can’t get it out of my head, i feel dirty just thinking about it.",,
I was 12 years old. I was 12 years old when I was asked for nudes and to meet up for sex from my classmate. I posted a picture on my instagram of me at the beach in a pink 2 piece swimsuit. A normal swim suit any 12 year old girl would wear. I was confident in the photo until I received a snapchat notification from my “friend”. He complemented me in the suit. I was flattered until he told me to show him what I looked like without it on. I said several times I was uncomfortable. He begged multiple times until I had to force myself to send him pictures. It was hard for me. He even forwarded the photos to his friends and told me it was my fault. 6 years later I can not get it off my mind. Ive been hurt since.,,
"I had been seeing a guy for just over a week and I met up with him on a night out. I was too drunk so he reassured all my friends he’d take me home and look after me. We went back to his room and he kept pushing me to have sex, saying he would “only put the tip in”. I kept saying no and eventually he gave up, and so I went to sleep, only waking up when I realised he was raping me and I had absolutely not been in a state to consent. I didn’t tell any of my friends because I didn’t come to terms with the fact it was rape for a long time and when I finally did I was so guilty I couldn’t tell anyone.",,
"Last year, one of my male best friends since literal birth assaulted me and I can’t help feeling like I let it happen. He kept coming up next to me when we watched movies and acting weird so I’d get up and move but he’d just follow. Eventually he worked up the courage and tried to reach up my shirt I tried to push his hands away but he kept coming back, I tried to say stop but I think he thought I was joking and he groped me. He then tried to reach into my pants at that point I pushed him off me. My parents keep inviting him over and I don’t think he thinks he did anything wrong.",,
There have been so many stories about [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I’m still here.I love this school but it’s clear there’s a problem. There were times I wasn’t allowed to leave a room until I gw someone as it was ‘unfair’ if I didn’t. All his friends get involved until you agree. So many people at so many parties. It’s unfair if you gw someone and don’t give them a hand job - when you’re 14. And it’s unfair when you’re 15 is you gw and don’t suck them off. So you do and they run downstairs and tell every boy at the party every detail. All girls are called easy or frigid and no in between. Pick one and youre stuck with it.,,
"I can't remember how old I was, but definitely under 16, when someone I got the bus with (Boy 1) told me him and his friends had been talking about me at a party he'd had at the weekend. Laughing, he told me that one of his group (Boy 2) fancied me (though we'd barely spoke), but because he was ""ugly"" and I don't drink alcohol, one of the other boys (Boy 3) had suggested giving me something or getting me secretly drunk so that Boy 2 could rape me. Boy 1 was laughing as he said it, and the fact he told me had, at the time, sort of reassured me that I was ""safe""- but I never felt safe around Boy 2 again, even though it was Boy 3 who has said it; Boy 3 was a good friend of mine too. I thought it was disgusting at the time, but the laughter and casualness of Boy 1 kind of negated how bad it was. I was really angry with Boy 2, and scared of him for years, even though it wasn't his suggestion. Boy 3, the one who was supposed to be my friend, was actually the worst one, and yet he faced no consequences for saying that.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by this guy 5 times. The first couple I didn’t think much of it, I wasn’t educated on this topic. I realised what was happening but was too scared to say anything as he was quite abusive previously. Once I came out with the story I got a lot of people telling me I was lying. I don’t want anyone to have to go through this but 99% of females have already.",,
"I was bullied relentlessly from year 7 largely with sexual comments and body shaming but with some online and physical violence. This was mainly by boys but girls joined in and nobody defended me. I talked to behaviour leaders but nobody ever did anything so I stopped saying anything because i was scared of retaliations. Other girls did this too and found they were just pretty much ignored. I was regularly given rape threats. They were just thrown around like they meant nothing. Girls at the school are body shamed, labelled and compared. Boys think it’s ok to loudly give their opinions about how girls look and make threats and comments even in classes and nobody challenges them. Girls don’t defend each other and sometimes join in the kill. There is a culture of silence protecting perpetrators and their groups of friends defend them and revenge attack if a victim tells.Toxic culture. I know of a number of cases like mine at the school.",,
"At [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], boys make constant derogatory and sexist jokes about girls. Boys brag openly about who they’ve slept with and happily slut-shame girls. I remember one girl was used by a group so they could all ‘have a go’.",,
My boyfriend would always make me have sex or do stuff with him because if I didn’t he would get angry and argue with me. He emotionally abused me so to make him feel “happy” I would do stuff with him even if I didn’t want to,,
Multiple boys at this school coerced girls for nudes and then leaked them. When I was 15/16 a guy convinced me to send him a striptease video. Months later I find out most Year 11s at that school have seen the video. I didn’t want my school to find out because one time a girl got suspended for sending nudes. Luckily one of my friends persuaded him to delete the video. I knew if anyone found out I would have been in trouble as well.,,
Sa got my butt touched without Consent and the school didn’t do anything about it after I told them,,
"There was a boy that used to sexually harass almost all the girls in my year, he would make horrible intrusive and violent sexual comments about us and even about our younger sisters. He would do this constantly in lessons and distract the whole class, myself and the other girls in my classes didn't feel comfortable or safe around him but sadly he did it so often we almost came to accept the harassment as normal. The most unforgivable thing was that he would harass us within earshot and eyesight of the teachers and none of them ever addressed what he was doing, none of them ever asked if we were alright. We couldn't report his behaviour as the school never took action in these situations and if it got out that we had reported him, the boys of our year would have defended him and made our lives hell. It was after leaving the school that I came to realise just how damaging his behaviour was and how much it affected me as a young girl.",,
I was in a club in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] on New year's Eve. I hardly ever wear a skirt or a dress but I did that night. A man in the club grabbed my vagina and I felt him touch my skin on the inside of my underwear. I felt absolutely violated. I spat in his race and ran away but the feeling of someone touching where they did not have concent has never left me.,,
"gropped by a group of boys in a locked room, just me and them.",,
Sexual assault and harassment has been reported many times to our teachers but nothing was ever done. It was emotionally and mentally draining as well as scary to be walking in a school with such disgusting people.,,
I was just starting secondary school at this point and I remember very well the lunch queues at school were horribly huge to the point that teachers had no control of this huge school pushing in this line for a whole hour. It was a fun experience to say the least but what went on during these pushes is awfully weird to think about. It was normally for boys of any age group to grope the asses and breasts of any girl student. As people were being thrown left right and centre of these queues it looked like a good enough excuse to do stuff like this. It was completely normalized until I got into around year 10 and this no longer happened to me personally but in fact now I was witnessing it. Young year 7 or 8 students being touched up under their skirt by year 10 students is something I’ll never get my head around. To know they felt a power over these young girls (and myself) is something I don’t like to even remotely think about let alone talk about.,,
"The boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] are only part of the problem. The other half of it is the institution. I remember after repeated SA/SH incidents happening during class, I complained multiple times as well as my parents writing in. The school did nothing, and instead victimised him by saying he had “issues”. This was incredibly upsetting, and lead to me hating the lesson time in the class. The school’s solution was to move me to a different class. This impacted my knowledge/grades in this class, and I find it upsetting how the school did nothing to prevent this when it is supposed to be so “forward thinking” yet protected someone who was preventing me from getting an education in that class to the best of my ability.",,
"Nothing too bad, but just to show how much rape culture and female objectification has become normalised. I regularly go out running. On more than one occasion I’ve had men hooting at me whilst they drive past me and laughing uproariously when I’ve checked behind me to discover nothing there. It’s never happened to any men or boys that I know, but I’m not the only girl who’s had this. Every time this happens to me, I feel invaded, and this behaviour is something considered more innocent. PLEASE PLEASE, to all the males who do this - JUST STOP. Girls and women are not objects, we are thinking and feeling people. The fact that I wear a skirt and long sleeve top is irrelevant but it just further proves that slut-shaming is baseless. No one can say that I was wearing something provocative. It is the fact that I am visibly female that causes this behaviour, as it is with serious crimes. Thank you everyone for hearing. And to all the girls who have suffered - I’m sorry, I stand with you, and I’m sending you love.",,
"Reading the testimonies I am saddened to realise that things haven’t changed since the 1980s. I was at a co-educational school then where boys outnumbered girls by 4 to 1.,My chemistry teacher thought it would be hilarious to put my name instead of slag in the word equation to describe the blast furnace. That’s what passed for a joke.,Against this background of general sexism it was quite normal to be cat-called or criticised for looks or breast size. I was sexually assaulted on two occasions by the same group of boys who jumped on me and groped me when I walked into a classroom at lunchtime. They had planned it, they were in a huddle when I walked in the room and before I knew it there were hands on my breasts and trying to get up my skirt. I was convinced it was my fault especially when it happened the second time. I told no one because I knew they’d say that I shouldn’t have gone into the classroom.,Years later, when I walked into a crowded lecture theatre at uni, it was ok for a male student to make a loud comment about my nipples but not ok for me to tell him equally loudly that I wouldn’t tolerate his sexual harassment. Apparently he was having a laugh and was a nice guy and I was being unreasonable.,These might seem small things but they shaped me and influenced me for many years.",,
"I was sexually assaulted in school and the school have been notified of it and the person has been brought to justice.They SA me and 3 other girls ,I was on the way to the girls toilets when this boy touched me and called me names and then on the way home from school I went to the park and he groped me and while I was kicking at him he said he knows I wants it ,he is now not in school and is in trouble with the police I’m not sure what punishment he has been given but I will be updated next week on what will happen to him ,thank you for this website it has helped me realise that I’m not alone in any of this",,
"When I was around 12 years old, I was walking home from my local train station after going shopping with a friend. It was summer time so I was in shorts and a long sleeve shirt. I was walking outside my local GP when a group of 15/16 year old boys walked past me. One of them turned and slapped me on my bum and all the others started jeering. There were multiple grown men and women on the street and not one of them helped me. I ran home crying and didn’t wear shorts again until I was 17/18.",,
It was during the half term and we met up with some friends and two girls we met up with were high . We made sure they did not hurt themselves as there were 20 of us in total boy and girls ( mostly girls ) after 14 people left one of the girls who were high proceeded to come out of a direction I was not facing and tried to kiss me as I swerved away she put her hand down my pants. Since then I don’t feel comfortable to meet up with girls in parks without parent supervision,,
I go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] the culture is disgusting last year me and my best friend were sexually assaulted numerous times by the same other pupil at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in lessons throughout the course of a term. Because we happened to be sat next to him in separate lessons. The guy would molest and grope us throughout many lessons under the desk it was very distressing/upsetting. The guy was a weirdo/creep and I was embarrassed to think I didn’t stop it at the time. I told my best friend and he happened to have the same experience - with the same person. It is one of the many reasons I feel uncomfortable at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and struggle with my sexuality.,,
Ive been harrased by one guy who keeps on catcalling me and slapping my behind and makes inappropiet jokes about me i have told him to stop but he wouldnt listen and he told me i was overreacting and how it isnt serious.,,
"My ex boyfriend was my neighbour in a student area we lived in at uni. He used to stay at mine most nights. One night he came round after a night out. He had had a lot to drink and started kissing me when he got into bed and I kissed him back. He then got on top of me and held me down. I was telling him I didn’t want to have sex and I wasn’t in the mood and for him to get off me, but he wouldn’t. I tried pushing him off and he still persisted. It wasn’t until I was in floods of tears that he actually got off me, albeit begrudgingly."",I did not deserve it.",,
There was a boy who wld run his hands up and down ur thighs under the table whenever u sat next to him. He’s done it to literally every girl I’ve talked to. Only now did we clock it was wrong.,,
"I was raped twice by my then 'boyfriend' in the bushes at the far end of the school field. The first time I gave up strugeling and saying no when I had managed to at least get him to wear a condom. The next time I remember was rough and painful and it made me bleed. I think I was 15 at the time. Sex was something that I just as excepted happened to you no matter what you did, I never explicitly concented to any sex with him, and often I would tell him no and try and stop him, it started when I was 14. He was also physically, emotionally and financialy abusive and controlling.",,
"There's a boy in my year. No one really likes him because he's loud and annoying but everyone just let him do what he wants. Including being really touchy, especially with girls including me. He makes comments and my body, he tell me about thing he want to do to me after ive told him many many time to stop and when i get upset im being sensitive because its ""just a joke"" I'd walk away but every time i do he grabs my arm or my shoulder or my chest :/",,
"On the way to school from age 11 to 16 I knew if I was in my uniform I should stay away from men on public transport if I was not with a group. Travelling on the bus one day I had a grown man seat himself beside me and slip his hand under my skirt whilst saying I was so pretty, I saw a friend walk up the stairs to the top deck and I almost yelled her name and she came over and I went away from the man. I was 12. But it was my fault according the my school. I reported it , to warn other girls at my school , and we then proceeded to get the same assembly every year about our skirt lengths being the issue, our earrings and makeup being provocative. The police complained to our school about the way we were dressed. We had a series of men flipping up girls skirts on the platform, and we were blamed.",,
I was 16 just finished my gcses (18 now) and I was invited to my male classmates house because we were good friends (previously dated but nothing at all happened then) and I was having a rough time with family. I went over and we drank some alcohol which I consented to but I reached my limit pretty quickly and became quite tipsy practically drunk. He suggested we play a game which resulted in me being topless then he kissed me which was my first kiss. After that had went on for a bit he had taken out his p*nis and told me to put my mouth on it and I said no so he then said just put your hands on it and I said no then he grabbed my hand and put it on it then he guided my hand over it so that I was pleasuring him. He then pushed my head down onto it so that was performing oral s*x. After that he was complimenting me and coercing me into continuing these acts with him and I did because I thought I had to and was scared of what the consequences could have been. We did not have sex he just made me continue those acts. At the time I thought it was normal and that it does take a bit of convincing to do sexual things but later learned that you shouldn’t have to be convinced into it. Especially as I was drunk.,,
he said we were supposed to watch the night sky. he lied and raped me. everybody called me horrible names!! bullied me not knowing the full story! he told everybody like he was proud of what he did.,,
"I liked this guy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and we were talking for a bit when it got a bit more intense. He wanted to have sex for so long until one day when the chance came and I said no, he guilt tripped me and said we wouldn’t speak again if I didn’t say yes then and there. Anyway only 2 years later I realised after it had happened I remembered I was crying the whole time and he didn’t stop when I repeatedly asked him to. I liked him so much I thought it was normal, but it was totally without consent and has messed up all my subsequent relationships and relationship with consent.",,
"i was 13, we grew up together. one night whilst we were on holiday, my friend, him and i decided to get drunk. i passed out and only found out the next day that he took advantage of me. his sister told me. he fingered me whilst pleasuring himself and then proceeded to give me oral sex. i never consented. i told my mother and she asked if i wanted to press chargers, i did not because i didn’t want people to think i was lying. to this day i don’t feel comfortable around him even though i’ve forgiven him.",,
in primary school a boy who was my friend touched my lady parts and lifted my skirt up then years later descibed my underwear and all the school done was said dont do it again,,
"I'm a boy and got with a girl at a party when we were about 16. At first it was consensual but I was drunk (she was drunk but much less drunk than I was - she was tipsy and still fully aware of everything that was going on while I was not) and when we went upstairs I passed out on the bed. When I woke up about 5 minutes later the girl had pulled down my pants and was trying to give me head and then have sex with me. At the time I was too drunk to realise what was going on or try to stop it from happening but now I know that it should not have gone on. I never spoke to her about it after because I felt like, if I was a boy, getting head and having sex would just have been considered a good thing and something to be proud of not something that had happened against my will. Although the majority of sexual assault is perpetrated against girls there are instances where the boy is sexually assaulted / taken advantage of by a girl and it is important to recognise this",,
"I attended [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The atmosphere in my college was misogynistic and intimidating. In the first few weeks the boys drinking society (dominated by boys from private schools) held a dinner in the college formal hall where they would invite the 'best-looking' fresher girls. They would openly boast about trying to get them as drunk as possible, and then they would go back to somebody's room for more drinking. For the initiation to the girls' drinking society girls would get totally drunk and go into the college bar wearing suspenders, a short skirt and a bra, and get boys to sign their bodies in marker pens. On two instances in my second year boys followed me home and forced themselves into my room, and refused to leave because they didn't want to walk back to their rooms. I woke up during one night and found one of the boys sexually assaulting me. I just lay there, I was too scared. Afterwards I told a few people about it and I was told not to take it too seriously. The drinking societies at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] created an extremely hierarchical, male dominated social scene that tainted all other areas of student life. It was the most miserable three years of my life.",,
"A few weeks ago, I was walking with a friend and we started getting yelled at by this large group of men. When we crossed the road to avoid them, they continued yelling at us. I couldn’t understand what they were saying because there were so many of them but I was scared they might follow us. I tried to laugh it off but I keep thinking about it and how messed up that was. We were children and they were grown men.",,
a boy in my year put his hand up my skirt and would not move it. the school did nothing to help and told me to stay quiet about it. this boy has done similar things to other girls in our year and again nothing happened. the teachers again told us to be quiet and the boy got no punishment. we were also told he had the right to his education and is safety is important,,
"When I was in year 11 I had my first boyfriend- he was in the year above and one of the ‘really nice guys’. One night he came to my house quite late- he had been out and I had just been at home and he was pretty drunk. We started watching a film and he kept trying to get with me which sometimes I did but he kept trying to accelerate it. He tried to finger me to which I said I didn’t feel like it- I hadn’t drunk anything, my parents were at home, he was really drunk and acting gross and I just didn’t feel like it. This happened multiple times where he kept trying to finger me and I kept saying that I wasn’t in the mood (he would temporarily stop then try again like 5 minutes later). Anyway after about five times of this happening I just let him finger me because it was too uncomfortable saying no again. I remember it hurt so much (I wasn’t turned on or anything so it was pretty forced on his behalf) and I remember just looking up at the ceiling crying waiting for it to stop. I never brought it up with this boy and we stopped going out not long after that. It angers me so much looking back on it. I’m so aware of the fact that I never felt very able to bring it up at the time because I didn’t think anyone would think it was a big deal and because I thought it was just something shit that I had to get over. It was really horrible behaviour that should have had some consequences. Also, the perpetuation of the whole ‘nice guy’ thing is so shitty because it makes you feel like you have misinterpreted their behaviour or made something out of nothing because they are just ‘so nice’ that they couldn’t possibly do anything like that. But from my experiences and lots of my friends experiences it’s often the ‘nice guy’ who does this stuff and basically always gets away with it.",,
"I always felt a little wierd around this one teacher, all the girls did, with quite a lot of the male teachers actually, but we kept it between ourselves, we didnt wamt to cause any drama or rumours, that's why i didnt tell anyone when he touched me in certain places, and said certain things to me. I am just so hapoy he's gone.",,
"I had been talking to this dude for a year or so and he had treated me really well. I hadn't seen any red flags and I was happy with him. He had the idea to skip class so we can talk and just hang out together. So we went to the old changing rooms where no one went anymore. He had started kissing me and trying to go further, I was telling him to stop but he wasn't listening. I was powerless in the situation but continued to fight back. He didn't stop and he continued until he raped me. He said that i should just ""appreciate that he even wanted me and did it to me."" I didn't go home that day until late at night. I haven't told my family about this. They only know about my sexual assault from 2019. But the dude that had raped me, he did it when i was 11. So in 2016. I was in year 7 and had just started at the high school. I've now finished high school and I never have to see him again since he will not continue going to the college i will attend. He is one year older then me.",,
"I was 13, he was 14/15. We had planned for him to lose my virginity at a party that night, but I got so drunk I was passing out. I had drank more that evening than I could ever drink as an adult now; vodka, cider, shots, alcho-pops, other spirits … I was so wasted. I could barely stand. He took me to a park and he had sex with me on the grass. He didn’t use protection and I barely new my name. It’s taken me almost a decade to realise that even though it was planned, I could not give consent that night because of how under the influence I was. He sexually assaulted me and that’s the start and finish of it all.",,
"This literally happened to me when I was 13. On school grounds, he pushed my head down toward his crotch and I just frozen up. It started a whole swath of false rumours of much more extensive things, with graffiti on school desks etc. Teachers did nothing to intervene or ask about my welfare. Was just made to feel embarrassed and ended up going home for a couple of days (from boarding school)",,
This boy I was seeing was really drunk after a night out and I didn’t want to have sex with him. Butt he ended up making me threw me on the bed and I hit my head on the side then when I kept struggling turned me over. In the morning there was a bit of blood on the pillow from my a cut on my head.,,
Basically when I was in year 7 I had a crush on some kid and he saw me walking home from school and ran over to me and put his arm around my neck I thought it was weird but I carried on walking he then asked me if I wanted to go to his house and I told him sure let me ask my mum so later that day I went to his house and we played on the Xbox but then he asked me if I wanted to play truth or dare I said sure so we started the game but it seemed a bit off because it said kiss the person on the right so I didn’t want to seem weird so I did which was the kid but it took a whole new turn and it started saying stuff like suck the person d*ck and I said I didn’t want to but he said I’m a weirdo if I don’t so I done what he asked but he kept asking for it and then a week later I came to his house again and we went to his room and said watch this and he unbuttoned his pants and started w*nking I looked away cause I thought it was weird but he told me to watch he kept doing things like that often and then he would grab my ass and try make me sit on his d*ck I didn’t want to but he would hold me down all the time and sometimes he would pull my hair if I if I struggle a couple months past he carry’s on doing stuff like that but then on the way home from tescos he says let me touch your v*gina and I didn’t want him to but he kept begging but I walked away saying no so he grabbed my hand and pulled me back bent me over and tried to hump me I didn’t like it but I couldn’t stop it and then he started trying to f*nger me from outside my clothes but then the next day he walked me home and said do you want to come mine tonight my friend is here and i said ok just cause I thought he wouldn’t touch me if his friend was there but he did he made us all play dirty truth or dare so he said pick dare cause you haven’t in a while so I did but it said he had to touch my b**bs but I didn’t want him too so I tried to leave but he said I’m ruining the fun and if I go he’ll tell everyone I suck d*ck for free and that I’m a sl*g which hurt me deep inside so I stayed so then he pulls up my top and starts to touch my breasts he continues to act like this until I go into year 9 I’m in year 10 now but sometimes it pops up in my head and I wonder why can’t I tell anyone I feel like sh*t but the same happened to my mum so my dads in prison but my family didn’t believe her and so my family don’t love me cause she got my dad in prison so like I said I wonder what if I speak up and my family disowns me because of it so I’m deciding to keep quiet unless anyone else from my school does,,
"So when I was in school not to long ago I sat next to this guy in history, I thought nothing of it . He messaged me for a day , claiming to be drunk (he’s 15) he then continued to tell me to break up with my boyfriend ( who I’m still with ) and said how my legs were really nice . He didn’t stop . He try’s speaking to me to this day",,
"When I was 17, I moved into a hostel (family issues). There was a worker there who tended to help me a lot, which was great for me to progress, but he was a little too forward with stuff. He 'protected' me from others as I was really young there. Once I moved out to another place (then 18), he helped out with the packing and moving across to my new place. There, he started to hug me and talk in a more 'open way'. About a week into being there, he picked me up in his car (this is technically allowed depending on circumstances) and we drove off to a field. We talked and then had sex, and he then drove me back. I thought I really liked him, but I felt disgusting every time he touched me. The last time I spoke to him alone was when he took me back to his place, and I stayed the night there. After that, I felt horrible and couldn't bear to do it anymore. I then moved into my own home, and refused to tell him where I was. My current partner knows of this and as to why I never spoke up, I knew I would be looked down upon and no one would understand what happened during those times. I know he's never said any of this to anyone, but I found out he got fired for trying to get with another girl from the same place who actually raised it. It feels more like I was manipulated than anything, even if my story doesn't look it, it definitely feels it.",,

At a very prestigious boarding school whereby members feel they have the right to comment on my sexiness. Makes me feel very uncomfortable and violated,,
I was at a birthday party when this boy restrained me by embracing me from behind and squeezing my arms against my chest. He continued by putting his hand in through my dungarees and then put his hand in my pants. I was begging and pleading with him to stop and let me go but he wouldn’t. Luckily someone came and saw what was happening and intervened. He was kicked out of the party but then waited for me to leave. He then tried to force himself into my uber but the driver wouldn’t let him. I know I’m not the only girl he’s tried to assault.,,
"It happened around [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and as much as I tried to convince myself it didn’t affect me it truly did. I was in year 10 at school and there was this boy who people in my friend group were friends with, he would always make comments about me inappropriately and had slapped my butt with a ruler so I already was cautious about him. We’re at our lunch break and in front of everyone he starts groping me. Your always told about what you should do in a situation but when it actually happens it’s totally different, my mind froze and went blank I just panicked and I remember thinking ‘this cannot be happening why me’ I walked out of his reach but still in the group so he would stop, which he didn’t. The worse thing was is that nobody helped me they all stood there laughing as if it was a joke, I was obviously very uncomfortable but I had to act as if it didn’t affect me. I thought it would stop but it kept happening practically everyday, I would be so nervous just standing there and purposely try to not be seen by him. In the morning I would not wear a skirt just in case it happened. And again each time it happened nobody helped me or asked if I was okay, I felt so humiliated as he was touching me in my private area in front of all of my friends, I vividly remember the last time he touched me as it was the most intense, it was harsher and lasted longer as he fully was touching my vagina through my underwear .And some of the boys in the group must of knew it was bad as they asked me if I had snitched on him cause of what he had been doing to me which made me certain that I couldn’t tell anyone cause I would be made fun of. I remember when this happened I tried to forget about it as when bad things happen I usually don’t remember it vividly as if my brain tries to forget it as it upsets me so much, but it’s really been getting to me lately I can’t get it out my head how it felt for everyone to watch me get touched and laugh at school. I’m not sure if I ever will tell anyone maybe one day but I just hope that more people understand how damaging sexual assault is it took me a year to realise this counts as sexual assault because of how confused I was of it, please help someone if you see it or even just ask if they’re okay",,
I was raped and sexually abused by my father as a child.,,
"When I was 14, a man grabbed my breast from behind on a tube station escalator. Earlier on the train, I had caught his eye by mistake whilst I was looking around the carriage. So I thought it was my fault. So I didn’t tell anyone. I already felt strange about my body changing and this made me hate myself more. I didn’t wear anything tight fitting until I was in my twenties. I have never let men touch my breasts, it feels too strange. I couldn’t cope when the midwife tried to help me breastfeed when I had a baby. I have never been able to feel comfortable with sex. I am now nearly 50. I could only even tell anyone about this decades after it happened and only then realised it was not my fault and that it was a crime. I’m not saying that this event was the reason I have struggled with things. But it certainly didn’t help!",,
"I took a bus to school everyday and people in older years would socialise with the younger years because the bus was small. One day I was alone at the back of the bus with a guy two years ahead of me, I was 14 and he was 16. At the time I had never even held hands with a boy romantically, never mind doing anything else. He made me sit on the inside seat so that I couldn’t get up and walk away and covered his legs with a coat. He held my wrist tightly as I tried to pull away from him making my hand do things to him that I didn’t want to do. I only got away because we reached my bus stop and I was left with bruising on my wrist. He was the type of guy who could talk his way out of anything, I didn’t think anyone would believe me if I spoke up so I silently endured two more years on the bus with him until he left. I still have trust issues near any guys to this day.",,
"I was 16/17 at a New Years Eve after party. My 'friend' messaged me around 5am seeing what I was up to. I replied saying I was super tired, just wanted to watch netflix and sleep and get away from the afters. He said I could watch TV at his because he was tired too. When I got to his he took me into his bedroom. I asked where his laptop was and he looked very confused. I said ""how else would we watch Netflix?' He again seemed very confused and replied 'Oh yeh... I guess we can watch something on my phone'. I was in my pyjamas and didn't think anything of it because we had been friends for a couple of years. After 10 mins into an episode of Big Mouth he started kissing me. Initially I didn't reject it. After a couple of minutes I rolled away and said ""I'm really tired and honestly, I just want to watch Netflix'. He said okay, and I thought that was that. 5 minutes later he starts kissing me again, this time lays on top of me. He then puts his hand down my trousers. I immediately push him off and tell him 'I don't want to do that'. He then tells me that ""he's really coked and needs to release his energy'. I tell him 'that's not my problem that you're coked' he then says that I 'should take some coke so that ( I ) can have energy to have sex with ( him )' i reply 'no I don't want to have sex or do anything with you I just want to watch netflix and sleep'. He says 'ok fair enough'... THEN he lays back resumes the episode of Big Mouth, rolls over switches off the light then rolls back on top of me, aggressively kisses and grabs my boobs. I then l say "" i said no "", turn on the light, grab my things and get a bus at 7am back home across london on New Years day. The next day I texted him and told him I felt super uncomfortable and that his actions should never ever be repeated on anyone. If someone refuses sex or any sexual act that doesn't mean that they should try harder. He did in fact apologise. I told him that I didn't forgive him because he asked me 'not to tell any of our friends about what happened because he didn't want people to think badly of him'. I DID tell many of our friends and all my friends decided that overall he's a 'decent guy' so chose to not talk to him about it.",,
"I was part of a support base for neurodivergent people in my school. I had just gotten back from a geography trip and a 6th year offered to help and so I let him. He touched me inappropriately instead of helping me with my worksheet on the trip. This went on for 2 hours. I burst out crying telling it to a teacher and she told me I was overreacting. As did the other teachers and my parents who were informed about it. I was 14 at the time, he was 18. I was told I was overreacting and he was told he was doing good.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by a guy whilst drunk at a party and I was not the only person he sexually assaulted that evening. I still get anxious about it over a year on. Many people continue to defend him - being drunk or a ""nice guy"" is not an excuse for sexual assault!",,
"Had a crush on a boy, we hung out after school before a halloween event. We walked the halls until we were alone and he walked and hugged me from behind. He asked me if I “felt it?” and i got off. He then brought me to a secluded corner and groped my breast. I backed away and he said “come on”. He seemed like he wanted to kiss me but i didn’t let him. luckily some of our mutual friends were walking our way and I felt relieved. I was very uncomfortable in the moment but thought i was nothing at the time but then i kept thinking about it the rest of the day and i got really upset. I was a sophomore (second year), i believe i was 15 and he was a junior (third year) that stayed back, he was maybe 17 or 18.",,
A group of boys group chat was called ‘Therapists’. I naively didn’t realise they thought it was funny as it meant ‘the rapists’ until after I found out. The name wasn’t inaccurate.,,
"Once, when I was 13 I drank with my friends as young teenagers do. I was intoxicated to the point that I lay half asleep on my friends sofa. I boy from school took the opportunity to have sex with me. I didn’t have the strength to push him off so I just lay there helplessly while telling him he shouldn’t do this. After this happened, I begged friends for support and I was called an attention seeker and a liar. Staff at my school were made aware and I was forced to sit in a room while staff told my parents that I was having reckless underage sex. The support staff knew the real situation from messages a student had shown them of what had really happened to me. Meanwhile the boy was applauded by the same people who exiled and belittled me.",,
We were in class one day and a boy in my class was going on about a class he wanted to make for school it was called rape club and it was about how all the boys would get to rape the girls for the period of time I thought this thought was absolutely disgusting,,
"I was speaking to this boy for a few months (16 years old) and I am 13 going to be 14 next year,I felt that I need him in my life and we I always went to his house while his nan was at bingo every Sunday. I went round there one Sunday with my brother and my brother had left to go to the local park with his friends,yet me and the boy were sat in his room,I begged my brother not to leave but he still did,the boy ended up getting very touchy,and started putting his f*ngers inside of me,I was scared,he then went on to put his di*k inside i begged him to stop but he still done it I felt disgusted in myself for letting him do that,but he was an older boy who was on top of me,stronger than me,I had no way of getting out..",,
"I was in the lower years of secondary, year 7 or 8, in DT class and due to a seating plan organised in alphabetical order I sat alone on a table with two boys who were friends with each other. I was a very shy kid so I never really spoke to them but they would chat to each other constantly through each lesson. I also found them intimidating as they both towered over me being rather short at the time, were very loud and also very popular in school. One lesson they began to argue about who had the biggest dick. I tried to ignore them and get on with my work. One of them then went and got rulers out of the shared equipment tray and suggested they measured them right there right now. I was really embarrassed at this point and gave them a distressed look which they saw. The same boy then stated that it wouldn’t be accurate unless they were hard so they both began to masterbate occasionally making eye contact with me and grinning. I was mortified. I very visibly uncomfortable and they must of seen that but that did not stop them. Once they were hard they stuck the rulers down their trousers to measure and then spent the rest of the lesson arguing and “bragging” about it. Every lesson I had with them after that I would move my chair as far away from them on the table as possible and spent as much time away from the table as I could get away with. However there were similar seating plans in other subjects too which meant I still had to spent a lot of time with them still, which from then on I found very uncomfortable. I didn’t tell the teacher because how was I supposed to explain that to him? I was already a very shy and I didn’t know the teacher well and the teacher was a he. I didn’t tell any other teachers because again how was I supposed to explain that? I told some of my friends at the time but none of them knew how to respond except to be discussed. I told my parents but they just laughed and basically said “boys will be boys” (though upon bringing up this story years later they became upset and said they should not have reacted that way and that it was very wrong.)",,
"I’d been pestered by this boy to come round and do the dirty for a while now. I’d made excuses constantly but one night I was drunk and at midnight he messaged me to say that he’d pick me up. I agreed. He parked us in this car park and told me to get in the back. At this point I was having second thoughts but I went along with it. We started kissing which was fine but he started biting my boobs and it was awful I told him not to but he persisted. The sex sort of began and I changed my mind I told him to stop but he thought I was playing “hard to get” or something stupid and started to choke me whenever I tried to speak I was literally trying to fight him off but he was a lot stronger so I eventually just gave up and did what he told me. At the end he acted like that was a normal sexual encounter. I didn’t say anything and he dropped me back off at my house. I told my friends about this happening but they, to this day, believe the guy who claims that I’m lying for attention and he “didn’t even finish”.",,
"A few months ago I got very drunk, I passed out and someone I know, who I thought was a really nice person, assaulted me. Till this day I still don’t know exactly what happened, and I don’t think I ever will. He has claimed he was really drunk and he doesn’t remember a thing. He then tried to get in bed with my friend soon after, luckily she was sober and able to get him away. When I told figures of authority, I was repeatedly asked why I was so drunk, and was what I wearing. As a result, I have lost a lot of self confidence, and I have so much anxiety. However I have had the most amazing love and support from my friends, and I could not be more grateful for them. Anyone who has suffered, PLEASE reach out.",,
"he coerced me into having sex with him. he said i was a tease and he would be unhappy if i didn’t. that i was boring, a prude. this went on for 45min of him trying to get me to do and everytime he said no he had one more reason, one more insult and one more manipulative comment, i did it because i was scared he would hate me if i didn’t, that he would hurt me either mentally or physically. i have never felt more vulnerable and it was so painful",,
"i went out with a friend who was meeting up with their bf. he brought along his friend and they were trying to get us to get together. he was really nice at first but as soon as my friend and their bf went off thats when things started going downhill, we went on a little walk to give them some privacy and he kept leading me further and further away but i didn’t think much of it. by now we were in a forest and there was this massive wall. i remember him taking me over to it and pushing me up against it. he started to kiss me and i kissed back but he kept going and after asking him to stop he didn’t listen. he was pinning me against the wall so i couldn’t move. i was getting more and more uncomfortable and i tried to push him away but he wouldn’t move. he started touching me in places i didn’t want him to and thing escalated from there. when he stopped he just walked away and i was left there crying my eyes out having to walk home in the dark. i called my friend so many times wanting them to pickup but they didn’t and every time i tried to speak up i would get interrupted till i decided it wasn’t worth it. but now I’ve decided to speak up and i hope nobody has to go through anything alone",,
"I’m not sure if this counts but back in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] i believe i was sexually harassed by a fellow pupil in my year in the hallways, i didn’t report because as i stated before i wasn’t sure if it was valid or not and i didn’t want people to think i was seeking for attention. After the incident i felt sick to my stomach and disgusted with myself and began to ask myself how i could let something like this happen to me.",,
"The thing that makes me most sad is how I treat myself. I have been chucked out of people houses at 5am because I wouldn’t sleep with them, called frigid, called easy and been felt up numerous times in my sleep. All of these people have been friends and I continue to call them such. I still hug them and ask how uni is and reminisce on holidays etc. Reading all these stories make me realise that I am allowing myself to underplay what has happened to me because I have accepted that boys will be boys. Why am I scared to call them out? I struggle to understand myself even as I write.",,
Somebody touched my boob and pressed my head into their private parts,,
In sixth form a lot of people started getting in relationships and having sex.

"so yesterday we had an assembly on the fact that our school is on the list of names, and saying how shocking they thought it was that people could behave that way. Which was an amazing way to move foreword and understand the rape culture and demolish it. but then my head of year clicked onto the next slide that read “have some self respect” and then the second bullet point on the slide was “don’t let anyone force you into doing something you don’t want to do”- In a conversation about rape and sexual assault. And i’m really mad about it. When I was being raped I didn’t think oh yes. let’s “have some self respect’- let’s let’s not let this happen so I can maintain my ‘self respect’ I shouldn’t have to- it shouldn’t have happened because HE should’ve known better. I couldn’t believe it as I sat there and listened to all of the 14 and 15 year old boys in my year hear that if a girl is raped it is because they have ‘no self respect’. When you are being raped you have no power in the situation and I feel like the school is shaming us for allowing it to happen when in fact it is their fault for allowing there to be a rape culture inside their school. I really just needed to share this because it made me so mad and I don’t want to explode when I go into school today and see everyone who was told that I have no self respect because of something that I couldn’t control.",,
I was walking to the yard of my school going home when a guy from my school follow me and kept groping and touching me and making me uncomfortable,,

I attempted to call my friends multiple times to come and help me and he was aware that I was trying to get help to get out of the situation yet continued harassing me. He then assaulted me and I felt as though I was completely helpless and vulnerable. After the situation I told me friends what had happened that night who made me aware how out of order his behaviour was. I confronted him and his response was “you wanted it thought.”",,
"On a night out at warehouse project me, my boyfriend and his friends were walking through a largely all male crowd during the octavian performance. all of a sudden a feel someone grope my bum from behind and i turn around to see a group of boys looking back at me had no idea who it was. the worst thing was i purposefully wore tracksuit so that i’d be less likely to be groped but it still ended up happening. i was crying in the emergency tent with my then bf and wanted to go home but he said we had to stay because he ‘wanted to see skepta’ and has paid for the ticket... we ended up staying and i felt pressured to ‘not let it ruin my night.’ exact same thing happened to me the next week at another event.",,

"I was 15 and a virgin. I had been dating this boy 2 years older for a few weeks when we planned to have sex. When we got to his house I said to him ""If I change my mind is that okay?"" and he said of course. When we got to his bed I told him I didn't want to do it anymore. He wouldn't give it up. He kept asking and asking and I kept making excuses until I finally said okay.",,
"In yr 9 my boyfriends best mate came up to me at a party while drunk and kept flirting me and touching me gently. After telling him to stop he got aggravated and began to full on grope me and even got into his underpants and started grinding on me. The worst thing was that when my boyfriend came I cried out for help but he just got into his underpants and started grinding on me from the front. I was so appalled that I just fell and started crying. My (should I mention) long term boyfriend just laughed and started moving my head nearer to his genitals. Reflecting now it was absolutely animal like and disgusting. I’m telling you, the atmosphere at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is horrific.

"I go to an all girl's secondary school. I had a girlfriend, who I thought I loved dearly. My parents did not know about our relationship so I had to manage all of this on my own. I was sexually assaulted on dozens of occasions, with her ignoring my tears and my pain, eventually convincing me that this was just how sexual stuff works (as she was the more experienced one). I naively believed her and put up with this for 6 months. I eventually broke up with her, and I thought it would be okay. Then l started hearing that she was telling other people that I was the perpetrator, not her. Retelling my story with the roles reversed. All of my friends knew, none of them told me about what she was doing or tell her that what she was doing was wrong. in addition, they all knew what she did to me and how it still effects me to this day. And they all pretend it didn't happen and are all still friends with her. Before I left, I was terrified of making new friends because of the lies that were told about me. And people have no idea of what she's truly like. To this day, I am still terrified of my ex girlfriend and what she may be telling people about me, and what she may do to me of she finds out I did this testimony. I live in fear and anxiety, unable to open up to others or even give my dad a hug because of my crippling fear of physical affection as a result of the assaults.",,
"Hi, I think I was assaulted by my 13 year old cousin when I was about 11. We were playing truth or dare and he dared me to follow him into the back room so he could show me something scary. I assumed a spider or something. He made me take of my dress and kiss him. I wasn’t wearing a bra at the time. I was a very earlier bloomer so I had cleavage. I told him I wasn’t wearing a bra so I wouldn’t take of my dress. I agreed to kissing him though. Which makes me feel like it doesn’t count as assault. I thought because WE ARE COUSINS that he would kiss my on the cheek or something. I don’t really know why I was so distracted and preoccupied I wasn’t really thinking but he kissed me right on the lips, I tried to pull away but he wouldn’t let me and kissed me further. He put his tonnage in my mouth and I tried not to throw up. I managed to pull away finally unlocked the door and went downstairs to the rest of the family and I never spoke about it again. it makes me SO uncomfortable to this day. Don’t really like being around him by myself. It’s been 3 years since.",,

I was on a train late at night after seeing my boyfriend. I was in a train carriage alone with this guy who was at least in his 30’s. He turned towards me got his thing out and started wanking. I got off the train straight away at the next stop and he got off with me. I changed trains and he followed me. It was a long ride home and he just sat on the train following me for about 30 minutes until he gave up and got off.,,
"My boyfriend took drugs and stayed at my home. He waited until he thought i was asleep to initiate sex with me. I lay there and let it happen. It took me months to admit to myself it was rape. I felt as though it wasn’t his fault because of the drugs. I blamed myself, more than i blamed him.",,

I never believed that he was capable of it and didn't believe myself.

"I was raped by a friend from a nearby boys school. We were in our final year, 17 years old on an (underaged) night out in London with a group of friends. I had recently broken up with one of our mutual friends. I don’t remember anything after arriving at the nightclub until being in a phone box with the police speaking to me. Two uniformed police officers asked if I knew this man. I couldn’t speak and I was confused - what man. I looked to my right and saw this male friend and then looked down and saw my tights and knickers around my ankles, my dress up around my waist. I was terrified. The police could clearly tell as they kept asking if I knew him - not if I was okay or needed help - just did I know him. I nodded or said yes but couldn’t find the words to say anything else. It must have been obvious I couldn’t speak. I don’t know how to explain it; it was like I had no free will or thought to do anything other than answer their questions. They made us leave the phone box and I kept looking around for their help but they walked away. Then he started to rape me again in the street. I think I must have shouted as they came back and told us this wasn’t allowed. One of our other friends in the club then took me to hospital. I don’t remember being there or what I told the doctors or nurses but nothing seemed to materialise. I was never contacted for any follow up so can only presume I didn’t tell them or they didn’t realise. When I got back to boarding school on the Sunday night I called the male friend who had done this to me to try to piece together what had happened. I was in total denial it was rape even though I knew it was not consensual. His words were “from the moment I saw you [that night] I knew I had to have you. It was like a game.” He also admitted to putting drugs in my drink (they were all casual drug users). The worst thing about the whole event in some ways is that I was so desperate to feel less disgusting and less used that I ended up starting a very brief affair with him; we slept together twice more and each time I’d have flashbacks to the phone box but I was desperate to make it feel consensual. I told the school and nobody did anything.,I wish this was a one off but there was an awful rape culture amongst these boys. In years prior, boys in that friend group had put their penises into the mouths of sleeping girls at a house party and tried to force them to give them head and, when they woke up, kept their hands on the backs of the girls’ heads. It’s horrific looking back but we had no idea how toxic this was, let alone that it was rape. I wish we’d known better and understood how to exercise our rights.",,
"When I was in my second year at university I went home with a man I met at a club, and we starting having sex. During this, I started to feel tired, we had both been drinking and I wanted to stop as I wasn't feeling well. I asked to stop and he didn't. I asked again and he continued, he was on top and much stronger than me. I started to cry, but he didn't stop until he had finished. Afterwards, he cried and said he couldn't believe he had done that. I was horrified, I didn't know what to say. I tried to forget what had happened the next day, and didn't tell anyone for long after it happened. Its only really recently that I've started to admit to myself that I was raped.",,
"Last year I was raped by a boy in the year bellow me, I was a virgin at the time and never spoke to boys at “parties” but this time I did and was lead into a room and the room was being “protected” by boys in the year above me. The boy did not take no for an answer and would just continue to push me over a bed. He did not stop until people walked in and saw me over the bed. No one knew it was inconsequential until I told my close friends months and months later. I have never wrote this out before in my life and it hurts believe I let a person do this to me.",,
"It’ll be just a normal day in school, wearing the school uniform with the pe hoodie on top. Most of the boys would ask you what you was wearing underneath or ask for nudes, they pressure you into sending them and if you didn’t you was a “pussy” or they’ll just stop talking to you and suddenly bully you. Most of the time they’ll be people in the same year. I’d get added by people on Snapchat from school and most was older years and they’d threaten you if you don’t send, or even if you didn’t agree to it. Some of them would talk about how they wished to do stuff to you",,
"I went to the school for under a month as an exchange. Within that month boys were joking about how they wanted to get with me which others responded to by suggesting they drug me. The school responded to this by apologising to me, however excused their behaviour by telling me that they weren’t used to my Australian content (me in a bikini) and that they just perceived me as fresh blood.",,
"There was a boy in my year who would make girls feel bad about themselves no matter what they did. To him, they had always done something wrong or something to be ashamed of. He would make jokes in the common room and because this usually happened in the common room with a lot of people around, it was always brushed off. I know that his comments impacted a lot of girls. I am sure he knows who he is but sadly I highly doubt he would apologise to anyone for his comments.",,
"Chatting casually at the end of a lecture a friend of a friend mentioned he had the same essay still to finish, so we agreed to work on it together. As soon as it was just the two of us, I let myself be talked into getting 'just the one' drink first (sounded better than the essay). He got me a pint of super strong (7%+) cider even though I said no, just lager. He then secretly got us a second round under the guise of going to the bathroom. Should have been a red flag really, but I just took it as shared friendly work-avoidance. Finally went back to his to work, but after a short time he was like 'you have loads more left to do than me and I don't want to spend my evening watching you finish this essay, let's watch a film; you can do the rest tomorrow'. It was getting late so I ultimately agreed. We were barely through the opening credits when he was already trying to put his hand up my shirt and kiss me and I suddenly realised I'd been a naive idiot and this is what he had in mind all along. I left, ended up being late handing in the essay, and for the rest of the year he ignored me completely even among mutual friends. It's not the worst thing that's happened, but it stuck with me because of the manipulative way the whole invitation to work together was a cover for a long predatory con, where his way of getting sex was pushing boundaries a little more at every step - and his response to being turned down made it crystal clear it really was just about that from the start. I had a high alcohol tolerance for a girl, so the super strong cider he was plying me with probably didn't make me quite as compliant as he hoped, and I think about how many other women he has in all likelihood tried to coerce similarly who might have different stories.",,
"I was year 7 so about 12 years old and I had just moved up to high school without any friends, so when the gcse students were teaching a class and one of them asked me to help them I didn’t think there could be bad people but we got into a store cupboard for a supply and he started backing me into a corner and forcing himself on me, I couldn’t get away and no one could hear. It was only a few minutes but it felt like forever",,
"My ex raped me on my 20th birthday. I remember telling him to stop and I was crying and he wouldn’t. I ran off afterwards then he “cried” and made me apologise to him for making him look like a bad person. Thankfully he is an ex and out of my life for nearly two years now however he is still trying to stalk me, contact me, follow me. Even going to lengths as to ask his friends to talk to me on his behalf or create new accounts to follow me on. I can only hope he won’t ever do it to another girl",,
"The popular Boys always inappropriately touch girls ( putting their hand up Girls skirts , touching their waists , grabbing their asses , taking photos and doing things from behind them wjen they don’t notice etc )",,
I was sat in a lesson in a seating plan. I was next to a guy who I really didn’t like and felt really uncomfortable around. I would never speak to him. One day we were watching a video in a lesson and he started touching my thighs. I slapped his hand away then 2 minutes later he did it again and whispered I know you like it. I was so scared and he kept moving his hand higher and higher up until the video was over. Later that night I was sent a video which his friend recorded of it and he said I know you wanted more and would not leave me alone. I blocked him online but I was still in class with him every week and I never told anyone because I was scared people would think I was being dramatic and that it wasn’t a big deal.,,
one day i was washing my blazer in the bathroom because i got ink on it then out of nowhere a girl comes in and turns the light off and starts touching me up i tell her to stop but she doesn’t and i try to push her but cause the light was off i couldn’t see. to this day she harasses me asking to jump to see my breasts bounce or she try’s to touch me.,,
"my boyfriend at the time forced himself on me multiple times, i told him no yet he still continued and i ended up freezing and letting him do it because he wanted to. other boys sexually assaulted me, sometimes during lessons yet i didnt think much about it as it wasnt rape. i was 15",,
"All my school life i have been sexually harassed by multiple students. They would touch me in inappropriate places and if i told them to stop, they would carry on and laugh at me. My friends tell me i should be greatful that i get this attention, but it’s unwanted attention. They don’t understand how horrible it feels for people to think it’s okay to touch me wherever they like.",,
"When I was about 17, I went to a club in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was with some friends and there were lots of old men around for some reason. One of them was groping my friend so I moved myself between him and her. He then proceeded to put his hands between my legs from behind and grab my vagina through my trousers. I spun around so fast and started screaming at him and shoving him. I asked why he thought it was okay to do that and was almost hysterical. He pretended he couldn’t hear me and ran off into the crowd and I was the one who was bad because his friends told security so I had to just calm down and walk away. It’s something that I took in my stride but I just worry for my friends who wouldn’t have stood up and just taken it.",,
"many at times boys has gone round and felt up girls at party’s or even at school, at my school girls can not wear shorts as it makes male teachers uncomfortable here is an idea don’t look. i was raped at the age of 8-10 every summer by many teen boys every summer with out doubt i get sexually assaulted after the news of the police and the vigil and broke down in tears. we are not safe, police, teachers and boys don’t care. “boys will be boys” said to me by my teachers at school. I WILL NOT BE SILENT",,
"On the way back from lectures I was followed home by two men. It was midday and I lived ten minutes from campus. I knew I was in danger as they had seen me behind them and doubled back to follow me as I turned the corner to my road. One of them crossed to the other side of the street and the other walked increasingly quickly behind me. Luckily, someone on my street opened their door and the guy behind me slowed just enough that I was able to get my key out and reach my door. As I opened my door and got into my house he pushed the door to follow me in, but luckily I was able to force it shut. It chills me to think what might have happened if my door had been further away, if that person hadn't opened their door, if my door hadn't had a latch lock.",,
"when i was in year 3 i was secretly friends with one of the popular/well known boys in my class. Everyone in the school was in assembly apart from me, this boy and a couple other people. We were playing hide and seek when he came up behind me and started grinding against me. i was startled and didn't know what to do. i had a crush on him and thought that this was him liking me back. This progressed to him taking me behind a shed and forcing his hands down my skirt, and then my knickers. i had asked him to stop multiple times. He didn't. He told me to relax and that it was normal. i felt extremely uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. This then progressed to him forcing his tongue down my throat. This would happen almost everyday. I was/still am bullied about my weight and i was scared that if i anyone found out that he would say i'm lying and bully me as much as everyone else did. i had told a few people who i thought were friends about what was going on but they never did anything about it. They just ignored it. It all got worse when one day we were sent to the office to get something and were going down a flight of stairs when he forced me to give him head. It was taking a huge toll on me and all of the abuse went on for about a year and a half when i finally snapped. Out of impulse i told my sister what had been going on and she told my mum. Who then told my Primary school. At my school we had a place called 'the family room' i spoke with a teacher who i already got counseling from. She asked me what happened, so i told her. She spoke to the boy and then she told me what he said. I had apparently asked for it. I was the one who started it. It was all because of me. I was told that they would speak to the police. And just like that it was forgotten about. in the space of 2 days all my trauma was forgotten about. They never spoke to the police. I never received counseling to do with the sexual assault. sometimes i think. Maybe it was my fault. Maybe i did ask for it. Its hard for me because whilst everyone in my age group is having sex, having boyfriends, i don't think i will ever be comfortable around a boy ever again. Talking about sex makes me feel a different level of uncomfortable. I never spoke about the issue with my parents afterwards. I don't want to. Its embarrassing and don't want them to feel uncomfortable knowing what happened to their once happy, unproblematic baby girl. I think about it alot. it makes me sad because i think that if it didn't happen i would be a different person. A happier person. A normal person.",,
"I went to a school in central Essex from the late 80s to the mid 90s. It was considered normal to male sexist and sexual comments and jokes, and that went as far as guys touching girls. We were expected to laugh it off, and as part of the ""lad culture"" then it was normal for guys to try it on. IT wasn't limited to school, it was part of the wider culture. You just got used to being touched up all the time, and if you had an issue with it, everyone would see you as the problem. As we were leaving the school, I had a boyfriend who was going to study aboad for a year. I agreed to sleep with him before he went, and then he would stay with me and we'd continue to be a couple when he got back. When the night came - it was a Monday, I remember it well- I decided I didn't want to and said no. He cotninued anyway and forced himself on me. I was scared. This is what girlfriends let their boyfriends do, wasn't it? When he finished, it was like nothing had happened. I felt guilty about making it difficult for him. I guess I still do at some level. It turned out that when he was away, he was writing to me but with lots of other people. He didn't so much as dump me as write to me about his new girlfriend who he'd been with for a while by then. I've never told my girl friends about what he did as I thought they'd blame me for leading him on or not being clear enough with him. They know something happened. I still have nightmares about it. One of them asked me outright recently and I still couldn't say yes. I'm scared of ruining his reputation because he made a mistake but more than 25 years later, it still haunts me.",,
"I was SA by a classmate (then, bf). I had to sit next to him in class every single day for a year afterwards because we were made to sit 'boy-girl-boy' in order of surname. My behaviour spiralled, I was slut shamed by the school for wearing a skirt. He was made Senior Prefect. Previously to this I was bullied by another schoolmate and when I told the school, multiple times it was ignored so I didn't think this incident would be any different. Years later and hours of therapy, I am doing better but the school does not take any accusations of bullying seriously, it slut shames girls, and it does not create a safe environment for students to speak about their abuse. I am 1/3 in my friendship group who experienced SA by a classmate. The laddish behaviour and 'boys will be boys' attitude is celebrated in this school.",,
"A few years ago when me and one of my friends were both 12 we to a bat mitzvah, they usually finish quite late this one finished at about midnight. When it finished me and my friend went outside to wait for my parents to arrive to pick us up when an old man uproched us and stood right infront of us. I think he was drunk and he was saying ‘I’m going to stab you’ and ‘I’m going to rape you’ thankfully my mum arrived just as this happened an she jumped infront of us and the guy walked away but I was still so frightened and scared about what had just happened. A few years later I was walking in a park when i saw a man sitting on a bench, I was hesitant to walk past as I usually try to avoid walking past men but I continued anyway. As I walked past the man lifted up his jacket that was on his lap and exposed himself to me. I’m 16.",,
"my ex boyfriend was really manipulative, but i let him get away with it because i liked him. one day he came to my house and kept trying to touch me, even after i repeatedly said no, he kept trying. i even offered him something else, and till this day i feel angry with myself that i thought i owed him something for saying no.",,
"Throughout freshman year, I had multiple instances where boys would grope me and touch my boobs and ass. When I repeatedly told them to stop, they would just laugh and keep on going. I asked bystanders and their friends for help, but they would just stare at us and say “its fine just let him.”",,
I was in grade 8 when it happened. I live in a boarding school that separate girls and boys side but then one night me and my friends decided to play games together and it was too late for the boys to go back to their side(2 boys and 3 girls including me). There were a boy and a girl up the bunk bed and 3 people were at the bottom bed me the guy and my friend. This guy he was in the same grade as me he lifted up my shirt including my bra and did things to me while I was sleeping. I didn’t feel anything because I was tired that day and I am a heavy sleeper. In the middle of the night I felt something so I woke up and I saw him on top of me still lifting my bra doing sexually actions then I said stop but I went back sleep thinking he would. One of my friend saw the whole thing but didn’t stop him. The fact that she sat there the whole night watching was messed up to me. One of the girl up the bunk bed knew the girl manage to tell him to stop but he didn’t. Few days after it happened the girl that was up the bunk bed told me it was an sexual assault and we should report it to the school but at that timeI didn’t know or having an understanding of what sexual assault is actually like so I didn’t do anything. She was the only one who really was trying to help me out because it wasn’t okay later we reported to the school and they did do something about it for a month. They kicked him out of boarding and make sure I was separated from the boy. I felt safer and my mental health was fine because I still didn’t have a clear understanding of sexual assault. However my parents didn’t wonder if I was okay they only focus on the fact that I made trouble breaking the rules in boarding. Till this days he still make jokes about it saying things such “ your chest got me in trouble multiple times already” this happened in an international school people are still friends with him and some ignored of that it happened but it disgusts me.,,
A boy I sit next to in class touched me under the table and grabbed my wrist and made me touch his penis. I couldn’t move he had his hand tight around my wrist and I couldn’t vocalise it to anyone. All I could do was sit there and wait for everything to go away.,,
"I was on a bus that I always used to get to school, the shops, home etc. I was sat at the top of the bus when a man came up and sat behind me. He didn’t say or do anything for a while but I was quite uncomfortable with his presence. He then sat next to me and proceeded to put him hand up my skirt. My school skirt. I was 15 years old and have never been the same after my privacy and consent was invaded.",,
"Ok so it wasn’t rape, it was sexual assault. And it happened to multiple people who never told anybody but their friends. This one dude who is known as “a star athlete” came up behind me and grabbed my butt. I gave him a shocked look but decided to think about what I could do to return home the “favor”. I decided to wait until gym to tell his mother who was my substitute at the moment. She ended up fussing him out in front of all of his friend and he sent me a whole paragraph practically begging me not to tell my parents or the administrators, as it was the week before the last football game of the season.",,
"I was really drunk at a party and this boy had kept saying he liked me. I didn’t want to get with him, but his friends kept coming up to me and pressuring me to do so, but I really didn’t want to. In the end I felt so guilty that I did it and I’ve regretted it for ages",,
"I was raped by someone on a sleepover who knew I wasn't interested in them sexually because I had politely told them I wasn't interested when they came on to me - they DEFINITELY weren't my type and I was waiting for someone special to lose my virginity to. I woke up to find they had climbed on top of me, put me inside them unprotected and was grinding so hard that it hurt. I pushed them off and went home. Everyone later gave me a pat on the back like it was some sort of accomplishment, that it had been going on for at least 10 minutes before I woke up. They had told everyone we had sex like it was totally normal. I WASN""T AWAKE! THEY WERE REVOLTING! I was viciously ridiculed on the first mention of what actually happened so I had to stay silent that I didn't want it and it was forced by upon me. I was in pain and had chronic fear about STIs, getting tested and that they had stolen something from me so so cheaply that I was holding close to my heart to share with someone who actually gave a shit about me - and they knew about this. To this day I can't talk about this to anyone, they don't take it seriously or they actually think there is something wrong with me. As a man, it has affected my trust in women. I will probably have to be silent for the rest of my life because the world doesn't care and will never care and every avenue for help is ridiculed too so I avoid that too.",,
This wasn't such long ago but I was taking a train every day to get home since we live about 1hour and a half away during those times a man on the train would ask me personal questions and tilt his phone camera down at my knees I wasn't sure if I was right about him recording me but as I looked up at the window behind him I could see he was on the camera app. This is not the only time I have been touched on the leg and cat called many times. This isn't exactly rape but some sort of assault.,,
"a guy added me on snapchat and i added him back due to it saying we had many mutual friends. the first thing he did was ask what i looked like. i send him a photo and he said “wow your really hot” i then asked him what he looked like and he sent me a photo, i realized the photo looked grainy and odd but i ignored it. we told each other our ages and i told him i am 14 and he is 16. he asked if i wanted to play a game and i said sure. we were playing truth or dare for a but when he dares me to send him a photo in my bra when i explicitly said i wasn’t doing anything sexual. i used the excuse that i was somewhere public and couldn’t and he kept asking me when i was going to get home. i always have suspicions when it comes to adding people and so when i felt weird about this i took a screenshot of his photo and reverse image searched it. i found the photo on google and on a few pinterest pins. i told him he didn’t fool me then he i added me, don’t trust people, you never know who they really are.",,
"[name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] SA’d me at a school dance. Was exposed, the school knew about it, but still let him back into the school.",,
It was the second time I’d met up with this boy and I went over to his house. We got quite drunk and he kept trying to touch me. I was trying to push him off and tell him to stop but he wouldn’t. He eventually pushed me down on the bed and raped me. He was being aggressive and choking me even though he could see my discomfort. I came out with a few bruises from how hard he’d been pinning me down. After it had all happened he even asked of I wanted to see him again later in the week like he hadn’t just completely taken advantage of me.,,
"I was 19 when I got into this relationship. Everyone loved him he was a fireman and everyone thought he was amazing. As a boyfriend he would cheat on me and he was emotionally abusive and would say if I didn’t have sex with him then he would get it else where. When he was trying to have sex I would say no and he would continue taking my clothes off and touching me. I would just lay there because I thought as his girlfriend that was my obligation. One day I said no and he held me down and said “sometimes I think I could just really hurt you.” All because i would say no to sex. I eventually got out of the relationship, 2 years later I seek help through a therapist but the pain never goes away.",,
"It was [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] 2019, my boyfriend of 6 months had broken up with me a month prior. I had heard a lot of rumors telling me he had already moved on and was seeing someone else. I felt the pressure to do the same. During lunch periods at my high school the auditorium was empty. A guy who was interested in helping me ‘move on’ said we could meet up in there and mess around. Initially i had agreed but the day of i was very anxious and didn’t want to go through with it. i was too scared to say no for the fear of him being angry at me. when we met up, we started making out but i was quickly overpowered and he had pinned me to the ground. he continued to touch me and do things that i had not consented to. that was the most terrifying moment of my life. i couldn’t move or speak out of pure fear, i felt paralyzed. if it wasn’t for the bell signaling that i needed to go to my next class i don’t know what would’ve happened. after that i had a panic attack in the bathroom and wanted to burn my clothes. it took me weeks to come to terms with the fact that i had been assaulted. something happened that i did not want nor consent to: that was how i knew it was assault. i never came forward and i probably never will, but i feel a small sense of peace knowing that i can at least say this somewhere and no one can invalidate me. after that incident it was very hard to go back into the auditorium and i never wore those clothes again. i can walk into my school without feeling nauseous, but i will never feel safe there again.",,

People used to stand behind girls in lessons and dare each other to touch her bum without consent. They found it funny. Girls were made to feel like it was a good thing because it meant that they were wanted by boys- in reality it was really really bad. Those girls were also slut shamed as a result,,
"In Year 6, I had to stay behind while everyone else went to assembly, so I was stood waiting for a teacher with my back to the line of children filing out. Someone slapped me quite hard on the arse.

I was assaulted several times at work I was afraid and wondered what this man would do next if the assaults would become sexual. Despite submitting two grievances against this very senior member of staff nothing was done to address this. In fact he turned to psychological bullying . I left after two years because I had enough and found my work life increasingly difficult. The company made me sign a disclaimer to not disclose this information. This was part of a reduced notice period. Therefore I trust this is an anonymous declaration .I was not alone because in this work situation this man continued to touch other women inappropriately. After talking to other members of staff he had acted in this manner over many years. Nothing was ever done to address this. Thank you for forming this website to allow our voices to be heard.,,
A classmate just kept touching me I told him to stop but didn’t I eventually walked away.I’ve only told some of my friends,,

"I was 13 at the time and I was in my lesson. Two boys made a joke about me. The joke went: “one girl walked into a bar and sat on the stool, she was fine and ordered a drink. (My name) walked into a bar and sat on the stool but she slid down it because her vagina was too loose as she’s a f**king slag” I was speechless. I told my teacher who told me to tell student support. I told student support and they asked me why I was so upset. For around an hour they continued to ask my why I was so upset about it, it was just a silly joke after all… they even asked me if I was having trouble at home and that was the reason I was so upset- which I replied to as “no I’m upset about the joke?” Nothing was wrong with my life at home. The next day I’d told some friends what had happened. The head of behaviour for the school came and got me out of lesson and told me I needed to stop talking about it now and let it go. I still haven’t let it go.",,

"I was on holiday on the way home from a club in the car with him, his parents and a friend, there was no space for me in the car so his parents just suggested I perched on his lap, so I did thinking it was no sexual suggestion to him considering he was 3 years older and in a relationship as was I at the time. He pulled me back from the very edge of his knees onto his groin, and began to grope and indecently touch me. It was incredibly painful and I felt so violated, considering I thought I had made a friendship with him on this holiday, I evidently misjudged his character. I froze, I couldnt move myself as he held me in place and felt couldnt say anything considering his parents were in the front seats on the car. He later realised that I didnt want it and blamed it on the 10 shots he drank that night. Was never recieved any sort of grief on his behalf, only defensiveness",,
"It’s frightening to hear about how normalised sexual assault has begun, so much so that i too have brushed off serious experiences (like being groped and shoved around by my boy mates as if i’m a toy) as “not that bad” or “just the usual”. All in the space of one day, I've been whistled at, had my breasts grabbed and been upskirted. I now am highly scared of wearing a skirt (one of the things that i feel confident in) in fear that it will happen again but i won’t be so lucky to have “only been groped”",,
I used to hang out with this kid that was my neighbour. We were around the same age. He didn’t grow up in a very stable household. His mom would often beat him and no feed him for days. He would sneak inside my house just to eat sometimes. We would usually hang out after school. When we hung out we usually plays sports or went on walks or played video games in his room. But one day we went outside to the back of his house. He wouldn’t tell me why we were going out there. Then we sat down and he proceeded to go on him phone and search something. About five minutes later he showed me. It was yoga videos. It wasn’t that bad so we started to do the yoga. It seemed fun at the time. But then he started going deeper into adult websites. He forced me to watch. He blackmailed me to stay and watch the videos with him. I didn’t like this. After the first one was over he put his hand on my thighs. It made me uncomfortable. I told him to stop and to please take his hand off of me. He didn’t do I got up and went home. I don’t care if he was going to blackmail me or my family at this point. I was not going to be touched by him. After a couple week I brushed it off. Then we started hanging out again. When we were outside he would squeeze my butt and my breast. I told him to stop because it made me feel uncomfortable but he just yelled at my to stop being so innocent. So I went home and I still see him every now and then but I don’t hang out with him. And I know that he has done that and much worse to other girls. One of them being my best friend. We both despise him now.,,
"this happened to me quite recently like 2 weeks ago. I was really close to a guy in my year, he used to date my bestfriend lets call her girl 1 so i was always around him. after they broke up i was there for both of them incase they needed anything this is when me and him became closer and started talking and facetiming all the time. A few months later me and my other bestfriend lets call her girl 2 went to his house he told us that other people were coming round so we said ye thats cool we will stay the night if thats okay with his parents. We all got drunk and he decided to take advantage of me which i didnt like but i just gave in, he put a blanket over me and started to get closer this is when he started to finger me which i was shocked by because i did not think he was that type of person but i let it happen which was stupid of me and to this day i feel humliated i let him do this to me. it got to later that night when we went to the living room where he sat down close next to me and put a blanket over me again, i asked him did he want me to give him a hand job he said yes and gave consent i did say to him if he doesnt want me to i won't. Then he procceded to finger me again in front of my friend she was sat on the same sofa as me and she felt extremely uncomfortable because she was just sat there looking at him putting me through pain. We all then drank more alcohol and then he asked me if i wanted to go upstairs i said yes because i was tired and just wanted to go to sleep, girl 2 was sleeping downstairs just after we went upstairs. When we got into the bedroom i got onto the bed and layed down with my legs closed, he then asked me if i wanted him to eat me out at this point i was really drunk so i just went with the flow and said yes but gave consent for him to do so, he was doing it and then asked if i wanted to have sex with him i said yes giving consent again which was fine. Then after i fell straight to sleep. The next day i woke up thinking that he would have put atleast something on my bottom half but he didn't, at this point i was then wondering what happened last night, i was caught in the moment, i just wanted to to see my friend at this point, but i was scared to move unless he said something at this point i didnt know what to do so i just stayed still and did nothing feeling upset. he woke up finally and i put my clothes back on and ran downstairs where girl 2 was. I genuinely thought he was a lovely boy, so loving and caring, he was there for me throughout alot i used to tell him everything even private stuff none of my friends or close friends knew i trusted him so much. after this i went home with girl 2 and it was all fine. she kept asking me if i was okay and i carried on saying i was fine. Then he asked me the next day if i wanted to come back, i said yes but i also messaged him and said i just want to be friends and not do anything he said ye thats fine. So I arrived at his house the following weekend when he told me before others were coming again and they didnt so he asked his cousin if he wanted to come over with his girlfriend and they were so nice. We went to his shed where we did beer pong but with vodka and captain morgan, which i felt a bit tipsy after because there was quite a bit in the cup. He then asked me if i was okay i said i was fine and asked to go inside he said thats fine so we did. Then he put a blanket over me infront of his cousin and started putting his hands in between my legs and i was pushing them away the closer he tried to get to my private parts and he then forced his hand back, i allowed it because i didnt want anything bad to happen to me. He then was trying to put his hand down my trousers which i wasnt allowing because i just wanted to be left alone, i said NO he didnt listen to me and still carried on doing it, I said NO more than once and still proceded to do so. Before hand he made cookies which had cannabis in and they were really strong i didnt think they were going to hit me as much as they actually did after this i was gone. i was so drowsy, my eyes were blood shot and i just wanted to sleep, then it got to 11pm when his cousin left with his girlfriend i was still awake by then, after they left i did go to sleep because i was tired. He put a blanket over me and a pillow under my head but i just wanted to sleep on my own, his mum told my mum that we would be staying in different rooms but that didnt happen, before i went to sleep i felt his hands on my legs again and i didnt like it at all i just wanted to move somewhere else just to get out of the situation i absolutely hated it. He then started to force his hands closer and this point i just had no effort to move them because i knew what was going to happen. I fell asleep and it was the next morning he was still touching me, i remembered though throughout the night he woke up a few times and asked me if i wanted to go upstairs i knew what was going to happen again so i said NO which he accepted and i was shocked but because im a light sleeper thats why i replied. He then left again for a while so curled up into a ball where he couldnt touch my legs at all. When i woke up i was in tears so scared because i just wanted to be with Girl 1 and Girl 2 but they werent anywhere near me so they couldnt help me. i then told one of my close boy friends and he tried to help me baring in mind his mum works at the school so at this point i knew the school were going to find out some way because she was going to say something. This boy tho helped me so much he calmed me down and comforted me i was so thankful. After a while i texted my mum and asked her to text his mum to take me back earlier because i could no longer be in that environment. i was petrified, anxious, mad at myself. i dont know why i put myself through such pain and why i went back i will never do such thing again. Thankfully this has been taken to the police where they have dealt with it but it made no impact on the boy at all he had been externally suspended for one day. i just know for future never to trust boys again.",,
"from when i was 3 to until about 10 i was sexually assaulted by my father. it was almost every single night. he would come upstairs to check on us. it happened to 2 of my other sisters too. i finally told one of my friends and he was arrested. my mom is still pissed off that she was left with all of us kids and constantly says she was hurt worse than us ""because she was married to him and loved him"". he's out now and my mom somehow cheated the system and he lives right next to us. she tells us to tell people that we dont mind that he lives there and she tries to brainwash us and says if i am good about my dad then i can get a dog. i cant wait until i can leave and never see any of them. two more years.",,
"When I was 11 all of the boys in my class went round and took pictures of each other's 'rape face'. They then culminated it into and album and sent it to all the girls in my year. At the time I didn't know what rape was, I just felt uncomfortable. When I got home I looked up what rape meant in the dictionary. I was so scared going into school for the next few weeks in case any of the boys in my class would try anything on me.",,
"When I was 14/15 a bunch of boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] would ask girls they were linking/ talking to for nudes. The girls would send nudes under the context that they could trust the guy and that the nudes weren’t going to be shared with anyone. The boys would then take photos of these girls nudes on another device (without permission from the girls) and they would then go to school and ‘trade’ these girls nudes around their year. They would ask other boys in their year ‘if you send me that nude, I’ll send you this nude’. All the boys would then have this large collection of girls nudes which they called a ‘wank bank’. This all happened with no consent from any of the girls. Some of the girls didn’t even know the boys whose ended up with their nudes on their phone. When the girls confronted the boys on this, they blamed the girls and branded them as ‘sluts’ and that it was their fault for sending, not taking any blame for what they had done. They also mocked the girls when they tried to stand up for themselves and refused or lied about deleting the photos. It just goes to show how all these privileged private schools boys have such entitlement to think that they can control girls and act in any way they seem fit.",,
"when i was in year nine there was a creepy teacher who would always keep me behind after lessons for no reasons at all. other girls also felt highly uncomfortable being around him, which made it worst when the school made him mine and other girls form tutor. there was one distinct event where i was walking up the stairs and he was behind me and when he got to the top he laughed and said you better roll your skirt down. this made me so incredibly uncomfortable and from then on things didnt change. whenever he walked around the classroom he would look under the desks at girls legs which many noticed to be unusual. after a while it got too much and i personally complained to the pastoral care teacher hoping that she would change something. unfortunately she did nothing, instead blaming me and saying that i took everything the wrong way. this all eventually caused me to leave the school, he’s still there and nothing has been done",,
when i was 17 i had slept with a few people and got a name for myself. at a house party a boy brought me into a room with him and asked to have sex with me and when i said no he told me ‘well i know you’ve shagged all these people so what’s wrong with me why won’t you shag me that’s so rude’ and started s guilt tripping me making me feel horrible about myself telling me ‘if i shagged this person i may aswell shag him too’ and locked the door and wouldn’t let me leave untill we had sex. i felt so dirty and used. i’ve not had sex with anyone since because i felt so grim about it and it’s been 3 years,,
"We had a big assembly with all the girls from my year and the year below, we were told our skirts were too short but we were told by our male headmaster and he said we were distracting male staff with our short skirts!",,
"I’ve had multiple occasions of being pressured and mistreated by men. First was when I was 13 years old and I was hanging out with a guy a year older than me in my neighborhood, like I usually did with two other friends. They weren’t there that day. This guy wanted to walk by the river so we started walking through an alfalfa field to get there before he shoved me down and started feeling me up and kissing my neck. This was my first time ever being touched by a guy and he was squeezing hard everywhere and ignoring my “stop” and “no’s”. Luckily I was able to get him off of me in a couple of minutes by kicking him in the crotch and ran home. I was too afraid to report him to the police because he threatened to tell everyone I was lying. The most recent incident was with an ex a couple years ago. He was my first everything and I thought I was in love. After cheating on me and being abusive we broke up, he got mad when people found out about it so he sent my nudes to everyone in town. My ex bestfriend who I hadn’t talked to in years got them from a random number and reached out to me about it. He threatened me off random numbers for months so I had to change my number. I couldn’t show my face for so long and I still get panic attacks going into that town. I’ve developed many health issues from the things that have happened and struggle daily to stay at a survivable weight.",,
"I'm not sure if this is severe enough to be posted on here, but as I was walking home from school, I passed a group of boys in the year below me. As I leveled with them, they asked if I had an Only fans (despite being well under 18) and asked how much I charged. They continued to ask questions about if I had one and commenting about it even as I was walking away. I had to pass them again the next week, and this time they were much more open with their behaviour. I was wearing my PE clothes and one of them kept looking back at me. As I approached them, I heard one of them say ""you know she can hear us, right?"" Which set my anxiety off big time. As I leveled with them again, one of them said: ""you know what, I'm just gonna stare at her arse"". Passing them was horrible because I could feel their eyes on there the whole time. When I was in front of them, the one who was speaking continued ""not like she has any"" in a malicious tone. The rest proceeded to laugh. I now don't like leaving early because I fear that I'll bump into them.",,
"My first boyfriend when I was 15 was mentally abusive and extremely controlling, he would always threaten to kill himself if I stuck up for myself or made him sad/angry in any way by not doing what he wanted. I lost my virginity to him, I loved him, and consented to sex many a time. But he kept pressuring me to do anal, every time I said no I do t want to. And over the year relationship ship he just kept begging and pressuring. One day we were in his room getting down to it, and me pushed me up against the window sill which was next to his bed, knelt behind me and said ‘go on let’s try it, you’ll like it I know it’ll make me happy’ I said no again and he started putting his fingers in. I tried to wriggle away but he held me firm and whispered in my ear go on do it for me. We don’t have to do it again if you don’t like it. So I gave in and said fine but if I say stop stop. He put it in I immediately didn’t like it and said no stop, he carried on and pushed me against the window. I remember the View of his garden the curtains were open. I said stop the curtains open everyone can see, he said so let them. And carried on until her finished. I felt so sick and I comfortable but felt scared to push him off and make him mad with me through fear I’ll make him mad or that I was just being frigid. It wasn’t until 9/10 years later, after watching 13 reasons why and seeing Bryce Walker force his girlfriend to have sex I realised I was raped. I never understood you could be raped by your own partner. To this day I have never been able I try anal again, I get flashbacks at the thought and feel ashamed and disgusted.",,
"I went to a boys house, I trusted this boy. He tried to kiss me but I wasn’t ready, when I refused he yelled at me and forced me to kiss him. He continued to group me and touch as I cried and begged for him to stop. After some time I got the courage to tell me counselor. She didn’t care. To this day I beat myself up over what I should of done and how I let him do it. I was 12.",,
I was walking to the bathroom and I seen this boy who I was friends with at the time and he called me over and then he pined me to the wall and started touching me all over my private parts and I was telling him to stop but he didn’t then my friend walked near the cut and he seen her and let me go and acting like he wasn’t touching me or anything happend,,
When I was in year 5 a boy in my class used to put his hand under my skirt and touch all up my leg to my private parts I didnt think anything of it then but now I know,,
I had a guy for years bully me and then start to try to finger me in class I never felt so uncomfortable in school and he would grab at my self harm,,
"I was in 1st grade at the time, 5 years old at least 1 month before my 6th birthday. He got closer and closer until he was inches away. I told him no because i felt uncomfortable but he kept putting his hands on me. I was sitting outside my classroom because of a misunderstanding I had with my teacher. She told me to stay outside and wait until she came out, when he saw that i was alone he took the moment to sexually assault me. While I was being raped I froze, I couldn’t move, speak or even think. All I knew was that I was scared and very uncomfortable. All the school did was change my class and he got away with it until he moved away from the school. He was also a student at the time. The school offered help from the psychologist and she did help in the best way she could. Teachers judged me and would talk in the corner while looking over at me. I never heard what they talked about but I knew it was about it. I still haven’t quite recovered from it and it’s been a very long 11 years since I was raped.",,
"When I was 13, my friend posted me and tagged me on her Snapchat story. A boy had searched up my username and added me, and we talked for a bit. Had a nice conversation, told me he went to the school down the road from me, and we had a great talk about all sorts of different middle school topics. Then, he asked me for nudes. At the time I had a boyfriend (who ended up r*ping me as well) and I said no. He insisted, and I kept saying no. Finally, he sent me pictures of his own. I told him I would block him if he didn’t stop, to my surprise, I learned he was 21. He then sent me a screenshot of my own address which he found by looking at my Instagram, finding my parents, then address searching them. He told me if I didn’t send, he would come to my house and make me regret it. I could see his snap location as well as right down my road. I still am scared hell do something and I think about it a lot, years later.",,
"I really don’t know where to begin, there are multiple events in my life that have changed my behaviour and attitude to sex which has resulted in issues with my marriage. Firstly, I was adopted into a loving family, they also had adopted a son. I remember he used to come into my bed and touch me and force me to carry out sexual acts on him. I never told anyone as I did not want to break my parents hearts. Secondly, I was camping with a friend and an older man who was or should have been in a position of trust had invited us to stay in his tent rather than go home! As we were sleeping he put his hands into my sleeping back and began touching me, I was only 14/15 and thought that if I just pretended to sleep he would stop! He didn’t and eventually I had to leave the tent and mumbled something about going to the toilet! My friend came out and she knew something had happened as she had heard ‘sounds’. We never told as we had put ourselves in harms way through our choices. This has affected who I am today and I’m relationships and attitude to sex.",,

(she told many people this) i didn’t realise what he had done until weeks after i blamed it on myself....",,
"my story isn’t as bad as some of the ones i’ve read on here. when i was younger i never really realised how men stared at me or touched me for slightly too long, the comments they made seemed weird given my age but i didn’t rlly think much of it. now i realise it all the time and the other day i opened the door to a gardener and realised he was looking at my tits rather than my face. i remember last year i was on holiday and i started to properly realise what was happening around me. in the space of two days i noticed 3 old men staring at my tits and then at the beach another older man filmed me in my bikini, i heard him talking so i assume he was on ft with his friends but i’m always so scared it could have been recorded and it’s still on his phone. i’m sure he was filming me cos i saw the phone following me exactly and caught what he was saying but i still question myself. it happened last yr and i’m only 15. i grew up super insecure and this lead to me seeking validation online. the first time i started talking to older guys was when i was 12 and the guy was like 17. i still talk to older guys now and am often pressurised into sending nudes. it’s starts off innocently but it gets serious so quickly and before ik it i feel obligated to send. i think the oldest i’ve send to is 19 and i know he wanked to me which makes me feel so dirty. recently i was talking to this one guy and he kept asking for more and more serious images. i blocked him after the night i sent but he still dms me regularly on insta to bug and harass me. i feel like my worth is only equal to the pleasure i can give men and this leads me to sexualise myself online making it hard to form genuine connections with guys . ive also chosen to send before which means i doubt myself when i’m forced into it- sometimes i feel like it doesn’t count cos i’ve chosen to send to other guys before.",,
"When I met my ex-boyfriend he had just had a rape case against him dropped due to a lack of evidence. Of course I believed he didn't do it, but slowly he started treating me in all the ways he denied treating her. He did so many disgusting things during our relationship, but his attitude towards sex, rape, and my body was the worst. It started with him saying that I couldn't keep coming round to his house and not have sex with him (I had never had sex before). Then it became pressuring me to have sex with him in my house (which my parents weren't ok with, and neither was I). When I didn't want to he'd get so angry, often to the point that I'd give in just so I didn't have to be scared any more. Over time his insistence was less coercive and more physical, with him holding me down and claiming he couldn't hear me say no, cry, or ask him to stop. I couldn't believe what was happening, and didn't register most of it until he had gotten between me and most of my friends. I saw him support his friends who had been raped - he definitely understood what it was, but didn't actually care. He even pretended that him cheating on me was actually him being sexually assaulted the same way I was years ago. I worry so much about the girls he will go on to hurt, but after seeing so many friends not get their rape cases to trial I don't have much hope of him seeing any punishment.",,
"Throughout my time at this school I was constantly harassed for pictures and videos from a group of boys who I thought were my friends. I felt obliged to send them in fear of no longer being included in the ‘friendship group’. The boys would then show each other the things I sent them and laugh about it. One night at a party I invited my friend to a party. That night she was sexually assaulted by one of the boys. When I returned to the school after that party, the boys called me into a room and intimidated me to make sure I did not support my friend with her police investigation. There was no support from the teachers, not even one conversation to support the people involved. I wish I had the strength to stand up to those boys.",,
I was really drunk and he took me to bed and gave me water...I thought he was just being nice. I woke up and he had his hand up my skirt. He did that knowing that I was unconscious. No one believed me at the time and everyone made jokes about it so I was forced to laugh it off. I was made to feel guilty that I had gotten myself too drunk and that it was my fault.,,
"I was 15 year old boy leaving my work experience placement at a primary school, for my lunch break a van with two males in their 20’s followed me and kept whistling at me and yelling sexual remarks towards me and honked at me to scare me. They lost me and then they found me again at some traffic lights and honked at me again an whistles back again, I gave them what they wanted and just blew a kiss at them idk why but seemed like reasonable a way in my head to get them to fuck off. Then I lose them again and then finally they saw me for the last time they honked and called me a “fag*t”, what kind gentleman they were.",,
"Throughout school (yr 5/6) boys would consistently grope my bum, thighs and breasts. One boy was notorious for positioning himself under a bench to grope people in our year. Another time a boy groped my breasts in front of people and everyone laughed it off. Boys would also crawl under tables to intentionally look up people's skirts (mine included). This happened often and we did not have the education to understand it was wrong.",,
A guy has a video of a girl giving him head and she has no idea he filmed it at the time. He still has it and has shown people.,,
"One boy I broke up with decided to make a rumour that people could pay me for sex. I guess he thought it was just a funny joke, however I was sexually assaulted because of this. People came up to me expecting this to be true and when I said no they’d try and force themselves on me. The school basically did nothing, and the boys who spread the rumour got a slap on the wrist at most. I couldn’t report the people who approached me in fear of being attacked again. It turns out I wasn’t the only one either.",,
"I have experienced and received numerous sexual comments about my body from a group of 13-14 year old boys and some in the year above. whenever I tell a teacher they all have the same response which is “ ignore them” “there just boys” “boys will be boys” but some teachers will tell them it’s not ok and do the bare minimum but the boys just laugh it off and don’t take it seriously and they don’t understand how uncomfortable they make me feel. I am also part of the lgbtq+ community and when these boys found out all they did was shout homophobic slurs to me and sexualise me and it’s makes me so uncomfortable and I know it doesn’t happen to just me lots of girls my age at my school have experienced this, it’s disgusting. But the biggest problem is the teachers and how little they care about the comments they make ,even if there small they still have a big impact on me mentally.",,
"When I was in year 9 at my first year at boarding school a boy would repeatedly ask me for nudes, I sent them to him. without me knowing he kept them on his phone - when I refused to send them again he would guilt trip me and then as I consistently said no it turned into black mail saying that he would show other people or tell other people what a slut I was, I tried to block him on socials ect being stuck at school the whole time it was something that I couldn’t get away from, for a long time I couldn’t tell anyone as I was so embarrassed to be slut shamed even though it wasn’t my fault, I found out he had done in to at least 4 other girls in my year, and the only comfort I ever got was knowing that they were in the same boat I was in.",,
We had this thing called slap butt friday i think you know what’s that all about but everyone was slapping everyone’s butt all the time sometimes some of the boys even grabbed the girls boobs.,,
When I was 15 I had my first boyfriend and to be honest I just thought sex just wasn’t for me (I’ve realised now at 21 it wasn’t the sex but I was just with the wrong person). I had a very low sex drive and was frequently pressured into sex with my boyfriend but I was too young to understand so I let him. I would lay in my bed and let him do what I thought he had to and when he left I felt disgusting. I would have to ask him before going to sleep to please not try to have sex with me because I was tired and I often woke up to him on top of me trying to have sex. With distance and support I have realised this was never normal and am getting support to recover from how it made me feel. I’m still struggling to blame him and accept it as “rape” or “sexual assault” because he was my boyfriend and I felt I owed that to him. But I am getting there now.,,
Was touched inappropriately by a student that i didn’t know.,,
"I was raped at a college party. I was drunk and went to the toilet with the boy who was my friend at the time, he was also drunk too and i thought i was doing the right thing making sure. He locked the door and i was saying “not looking not looking” whilst covering my face and looking towards the shower. It happened so fast the way he came over and pushed me against the sink. i was 17 at the time, it absolutely destroyed me. I told my parents 4 days after because the amount of abuse i was getting from the entire college we went to was becoming unbearable. the Police took my statement then dropped my case. i had evidence against him, bruising and tearing inside my vag*na that he caused, blood on the bathroom tiles from me and still i was left face down in the dirt with ongoing PTSD and nightmares every night. i’ve had 3 councillors and ended up in hospital once after trying to take my life. I was placed on the High Risk Safeguarding watch, basically the highest priority student in college for me to walk into him twice within the first week. i went from a full time student to having to pull out of college entirely because i just wasn’t safe, him and too many other people hated me for it. i spent 8 months with the police for them to turn around and say the CPS won’t believe me and dropped my case. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE!!! i have relived this day EVERYDAY for 3 years and he walks around free and happy",,
one time i was at school in the changing rooms getting changed for games. one of the female teachers came and sat opposite me and just watched me whilst i changed. i noticed so i took my stuff and moved somewhere else. she followed me and sat down where i now was. i asked her if i could go to the toilet because i felt uncomfortable and she told me that we’re all girls here and have the ‘same bits and bobs’. i had to change infront of her.,,
In high school freshman year I had a very emotionally and physically abusive boyfriend. one day tho he touched me in an inappropriate way. When I asked him to stop he still continued. I was in the car with my mother in the front seat the whole time but I was too scared to say anything. When I had confronted him about it later on he first tried to gaslight me. When that didn’t work he told his friends and made it seem like I “wanted it”. I was called things like whore and slut and homophobic slurs (im bi) for weeks. And even when I had told my school they didn’t do anything about it. And believed him over me. I was 14..I just wanted him to stop..,,
"When I was 14, one of my friends would repeatedly send me sexual imagines and content, and would threaten me with rape and ask me to engage in sexual acts, even after I had said no.",,
"When I was 15 I went with a friend to a park to meet these guys (I had never met but she was friends with them). Pretty quickly after meeting them one of them asked to go on a walk around the park and thinking it was harmless, I agreed. I remember him asking me a question and was so disinterested in the answer he stuck his tongue down my throat. I later learned from his friends (in a jokey, “boys will be boys”, non-critical way) that “the walk” was a tactic he used to get with lots of girls - he even had a specific name for this “tactic”. He led me into the forest area got out his dick and put my hand on it. I said I don’t feel comfortable doing this and he consistently said “please just quickly my dicks already out” etc. So I gave in and gave him a hand job. Didn’t realise this was sexual coercion at the time. I felt so disgusting about myself, less so about him. Later on when it was dark and the park was empty (we were there for a while) he sat on a park bench and told me to give him head. I said no, I don’t feel comfortable with that, we’re in a park. He pushed me down and said “you’re on your knees now so you’re already half way there, you might as well.” Those words always stick with me. I did it. And again, I felt disgusting about myself. I didn’t talk to him or see him again for a long time (so long that I tried to let go of this memory of him and his words, face and actions) he was brought up occasionally and I heard he liked to call me not by my name (maybe he couldn’t remember it) but instead as “the busty one from the park”. I left that night feeling violated, but I think most of my anger was towards myself. Asking myself why I didn’t walk away or go home or tell my friend how it felt. The only explanation is I didn’t feel like I could - I wish more men would understand that assault is more nuanced than the trope of the “stranger dressed in black lurking in the alleyway” (although of course it can be that too). It is more often than not with people who the victim is acquainted with and so you naturally question how the intentions of the perpetrator could be bad when he is someone you know. And walking away rarely feels like an option - not only because of the physical dominance which is being enforced but also the paralysis of fear which makes you feel unable to “fight back”. Have you ever been so frightened that you are stilled, silent and you feel like your body goes numb? That’s how it felt. About a year and a half later and that night was “forgotten” by everyone there. I’m not sure I even spoke about it much. I internalised it to the point where I could hardly see the bad side in him and only a constant belief that if anything it was my fault for not walking away. I tried to convince myself that he was young and he didn’t mean harm (clearly a manifestation of the “boys will be boys” bull shit) and I was young so I didn’t retaliate - “I didn’t know my worth back then so didn’t intervene” I would tell myself. Retrospectively a very problematic coping strategy but one which, on the surface, seemed to work for me. I went to my friends house (year and a half later) and he was there. And I didn’t mind because I didn’t associate him with that person who assaulted me - in my mind I had excused what he did, repressed it (again a necessary coping strategy as I felt like I had to “get on” with my life and succumbing to the reality of that situation, I knew would take its toll). A lot of alcohol later and we were playing strip truth or dare and games like that. This escalated to more sexual dares etc. I did not kiss him at this point. Not until we all went downstairs into a small room. And we were all kissing each other. Was an extremely strange experience but we were all drunk at this point. Some friends went upstairs and it was me, my friend and him left in the room. At one point I was kissing him and all I could think was “I hope my friend doesn’t leave the room because I know what he would try to do and I don’t know how I would stop it”. I looked to my side and my friend had left. I remember being so angry that she had left whether justifiably or not. He was blocking the door and next thing I know he was on top of me trying to take my clothes off. I wasn’t kissing back, I was scared. He got his dick out and pulled down my trousers going to put it inside me. I said NO. The fact he would have done it unless I had interrupted terrifies me. He once again used those words he had used 1 and a half years before “but we’re so close we might as well”. No way I said. It was made difficult to run out of the room considering he was blocking the door and on top of me so I couldn’t move easily. People say “why don’t you scream?” But you are frozen. You don’t feel like you can. That sense of entitlement to your body that he showed made me feel like “you know what maybe he’s right - maybe my opinion on whether or not we should have sex is his and not mine” (once again, internalised victim blaming which I have since tried my best to dismantle). We didn’t have sex - if we had it would have been rape. But he did make me give him head and that IS sexual assault - even if it took me a while to realise the severity of this situation. I remember being angry at my friend for leaving the room, knowing the history. Angry at myself. But only later, once I dismantled all the victim blaming I had received (and women in general receive every day!) and once I had replayed the situation many times in my head did I realise just how ugly he was and just how violent his behaviour was. A year and a bit on from the most recent event and 3 ish years since the first time, I can say that this has hugely impacted my life since - in the way it makes me constantly question my self worth, the power of my opinion and my voice (since he clearly didn’t feel it was necessary), the way I view myself as inferior in relationships, the way I often find myself falling into the trap of thinking the only gratification I can give men is my sexual appeal, nothing more. I want people to FULLY understand that kissing someone doesn’t mean consenting to everything else. I also want people to know that sexual assault is so complex - so many times I’ve convinced myself he’s not awful and what happened was bearable, survivable as I try to keep up a tough skin and tell myself “at least I wasn’t raped” - I think that’s a coping mechanism which I created to make myself feel less violated by what happened - so I don’t have to confront that pain. So many times I’ve told myself that what happened that night was my fault for knowing how uncomfortable he made me feel and yet allowing that to happen once again. Men like this aren’t easy to spot - on the surface he seems funny, nice, dresses normally, he even frames himself as a feminist, posting something on Instagram the other day about how to make women feel safer in the wake of Sarah Everard’s murder. Does this show the extent of performative activism and his attempt to frame himself as a “nice guy”? OR perhaps he genuinely is not aware of how what he did was wrong and how much of an impact his actions have burdened my life. Both are equally terrifying conclusions to me. It’s only after finding out I’m not the only girl he’s sexually assaulted, even hearing an account from a close friend of his behaviour towards her, that I began to fully believe that what he did was disgusting and give myself the space to feel it and be vulnerable about what happened. I worry about the fact that if I can internalise his treatment of me to the point where I doubt whether he is even a “bad” person, then what other trauma from this situation am I carrying subconsciously?",,
"I was at a small gathering at my friends house with about 5 close boys and 5 close girls. We were all young so about 14/15 and my friends family were away so we were all drinking. I was by far the most drunk and was barely able to hold myself together after being sick so much so my friends put me to bed and just carried on chatting on the floor of the bed room. This is the last thing I remember of the night due to passing out from being so drunk. When I woke up my friends were all laughing and giggling asking me if I remembered being fingered by one of the boys. I remember just thinking they were joking. Apparently one of the boys looked under the duvet where the boy had climbed into the bed with me and noticed what he was doing. I remember not being able to stop thinking about it for the next month, like as soon as I was alone it was all I’d think about. To make things even worse one of the girls at school who was friends with the boy had pictures on her phone of me and the boy in bed and was showing people , laughing about it. Then about a month later I was with the same group from that night and I remember everyone thinking it was hilarious to nickname the boy a rapist. Even he would laugh and shake his head when he was called it. Safe to say I’ve cut both the boys and girls from that group out of my life nowadays.",,
I was groped by a man on the tube a few years ago. It was in a busy carriage so he tried to make it seem like it was an accident but when I edged away he just did it again. Now I wait for several trains to go by before I get on the tube because I’m scared it will happen again.,,
"When I was in [University name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] a boy who I was regularly sleeping with raped me one night. I felt incredibly sick and ill - he said, make yourself sick so I can have sex with you. I felt like a body. I was passing it and he just put himself in men anyway. I woke up to him inside me",,
"I was 13. It was school sports day and I was sitting on the school field with a friend, watching the track events. A boy snuck up behind me and grabbed my arms behind my back whilst his friend put his hand up my skirt and into my pants. I was squirming and kicking but I couldn't free myself of them. The boy with his hand in my pants, said something obscene (which I still feel too humiliated to repeat, many years later) and then they ran off laughing. I was angry, humiliated, mortified. I remember gazing at the ground, not daring to look up and see who might have witnessed the assault.",,
"Very recently perhaps a few days ago, a couple of me and my friends went to this boys house. This boy was very drunk and started trying to finger me whilst trying to get me drunk. I repeatedly told him no but he wouldn’t stop. I couldn’t do anything about it.",,
"During my study abroad, I was raped. I was drunk, and walking home alone, and a friend offered to walk me back. He met me nearby, and I can remember thinking how kind it was. He didn’t take me home, he took advantage of my drunken state. I passed out, and in the morning he was just sat, looking at me. I grabbed my stuff, tied the ripped strap on my dress back up, and ran. I didn’t even put on my shoes. I had glass in my feet by the time I got home, I can remember the blood going down the shower drain. I spent two days wrapped in my duvet on the bathroom floor, unable to even get up. I spent years telling myself that I should have got a taxi, that I should have not stayed out too late. Knowing it isn’t your fault is good, but if you don’t feel it deep down, it may as well make no difference.",,
"I was seeing a guy who had lead me to believe that he really liked me. He invited me to his flat so we could decide what to do that evening as he lived in the city centre. I'd suggested to go for food or cinema. He picked me up and carried me to his room and laid me on the bed. He initiated and I felt compelled to agree given that he was forcing and pining me down. He said he would wear protection and I saw him get it out of the drawer and open it and put it on. I pleaded for him to stop but he didn't. Afterwards he said that I would need to go into the bathroom to tidy up as he had taken the protection off. He never told me. I then had to go to the health clinic to make sure I had not caught anything. A few weeks later he posted pictures of a girl on his social media naked whilst she was sat down from the back, the next night he took a picture in bed with another girl. I admit that I was naive. I never consented to him taking off the protection. In some ways was this rape?",,
"""I am a male. As a boy I was a victim of sexual harassment by men on numerous occasions. At 15, sitting on the tube in the very late hours of the night on the way back from my then-girlfriend’s house, I was intimidated by two men in their twenties, who stood in front of me, stared at me and spoke loudly to each other about how I was a pretty boy and that they wanted to fuck me. All the while they were staring at me and touching their genitals over their clothing. I was terrified.,I was also groped on numerous occasions by men at festivals. Going to a festival as a boy I never thought this would happen to me, so when it happened, I was petrified. I felt a man press his penis against me from behind. Too scared to turn around, I edged forward. Finally gaining the confidence to turn around, I locked eyes with a man in his early thirties. He gave me a cold stare and a chilling smile.,One time sitting on the upper deck of a bus at the age of 16, a man around 40 years old walked to the back of the bus, sat in the middle seat of the five at the back, pulled out his erect penis and started masturbating. I couldn’t believe it and could not look at him directly because of this disbelief, but I could see out of the corner of my eye exactly what he was doing.,I am heterosexual, but all of this sexual abuse from men led me to an identity crisis about my sexuality. I had crippling anxiety and depression at the age of 15, and thought about killing myself on multiple occasions, because I felt I completely lost a sense of self. On the one hand I knew I liked girls and that I did not want to be romantically involved with or have sex with a man; on the other hand these violations made me see myself as an object of male pleasure. I had no confidence, no self worth, and a constant fear of being groped, touched or commented on.,Every single one of these things happened when I was a child. Only once I grew and became confident in my own strength and stature was I freed from this abuse. These men were disgusting pedophiles. Because of them I am still overcoming deep-rooted sexual anxiety.""",,
"I was raped at an 18th birthday party about 3 years ago. It happened at the back of the garden and another boy saw it happening yet did nothing to help and just laughed. Bare in mind it was extremely obvious I was not consenting to what was happening.,I eventually broke down and told my parents who encouraged me to go to the police which I was absolutely terrified to do and it took every piece of courage to do so. I did it as I was so terrified of another girl going through this. After being told by the police that I would have to give up my phone and laptop for up to a year in order for them to take the case further and being asked extremely intrusions questions repeatedly, I withdrew my claim. This is something I deeply regret but I know so many people go through.,I am now focusing my dissertation at uni on rape and sexual assault in order to attempt to understand why someone would be driven to do this to someone else. I was deeply traumatised by the incident and also by my experience with the police. This was over 3 years ago and it’s still something I think about most days yet haven’t spoken about it since I last spoke to the police.",,
"My school is awful at handling bullying, this area included, boys in my year use so many awful terms, such as 'slut' and 'whore' to describe the girls, and some won't take no for an answer when one of us aren't interested. They spread rumours that aren't true just because we damaged their ego by saying no.",,
"This isn't as bad as a lot of the other stories but it's affected and stuck with me still. When I was 13/14 a guy in the year above me started messaging me and strarted coercing me into sending nudes to him. When I said I didn't want to he kept asking more and more. When he realised I wasn't going to send he started asking for just me in revealing clothes and saying that was fine it wasn't anything bad. Also that I was going to give him blue balls if I didn't and that it would be my fault for turning him on when I hadn't sent anything sexual at all. He tried getting me to send more and more of myself and saying it would be my fault but I didn't really know what that meant, I was too young to think it wasn't my fault at all. Without asking me he sent me many dick pics, videos and explicitly saying all these things he wanted to do to me and it made me feel sick every time. This went on for a while and I was scared to block him because he could see me in real life or rumours would spread and I didn't want that. When I finally did, he found all my other social media accounts by stalking me online (one if them was inactive and didn't follow any people or have followers) and made me feel like I had to unblock him or people would find out that I'd sent him any kind of picture (which I never wanted to in the first place). This went on for a few months until I finally told someone but this was the start of me feeling anxious for every time I leave the house (amongst the catcalling and stares from men for to long) and talking to any guy that seemed remotely interested in me. Now, I think being sent a dick pic or anything like that without consent just something I have to deal with day to day as completely normal as a lot of guys do it.",,
"I was held down in the back stage of the auditorium, elevated on a prop couch sitting on several feet of metal stage risers, I was screaming, begging for help the entire time, only at the end did someone walk in, resulting in me getting thrown off the couch, several feet onto the concrete floor, the thud and my screams being the only noise in the auditorium.",,
"in my sophomore year, i met a boy. we hit it off very well and i thought he was the one after being with so many toxic men. turns out i was wrong, three months in, he gaslighted me into thinking i was wrong when i refused to give oral s*x. he continued this for 5 more months and would get mad when i said no. i broke it off finally and he continued to torment me and tell others i was lying when i told my story.",,

We sat there and he said he wanted to eat me out. In my last relationship, I was sexually assaulted when I was sleeping and I was still healing from that. I told him I didn’t know. He kept begging and I kept saying I wasn’t ready. But he didn’t care. I can still feel him pulling my pants down. I should’ve fought but all I did was freeze. I started crying and I just wanted him to stop. I told him to stop but he didn’t until i could pull my pants up. I just sat there so ashamed and disgusted afterwards.",,
"I spent two years at a private school which, at the time, accepted girls for A levels only. Those 2 years were horrendous. The first time the 'new girls' arrived in the school dining room, we were given marks out of 10 based on our 'hotness'. From then on, it was constant comments and hassle about our appearance, clothes, and behaviour. I stopped going to eat in the dining room as much as possible - two of my close friends became anorexic. I felt so ashamed of myself for not looking perfect, and still have issues over my appearance. A few days before I left, I remember sitting on my own in the sunshine when a group of boys walked by and started barking at me - I was ""a dog"". It didn't even cross my mind to tell anyone, friends or teachers, because it was so normal and I felt it was my fault anyway. Those two years of verbal abuse have left me so angry and upset.",,
"my boyfriend got high and wanted to have sex. i didn't even have time to say no. by the time i had a chance to say no, i was scared he would react badly. i stayed quiet during, and cried myself to sleep after that while he carried on touching me. i don't now how long that went on for but in the morning he couldn't remember any of it. where do you even go from there??",,

I woke up the next morning with a dirty sock in my mouth, naked on an outdoor deckchair. The boys had thrown a towel over me which was covered in their cum and i had three cigarette burns on my thighs.

A boy 2/3 years older than me repeatedly tried to finger me even asking ‘why are your legs crossed’ when they obviously were to stop him. He zipped down my jeans and out his fingers in me. I giggled and pushed him off jogging back to my friends. I turned it into a joke. Thé next day at school people knew but didn’t understand. I was slut shamed the whole day and told to have some self respect. I found out my mum had told her male friend and called me a slut. She doesn’t know I saw the messages.,,
"""Once in a club, these older men in their late 20’s kept asking all the girls in sight to kiss them and would keep harassing them if they said no. One of the men acted nice and kept apologising for ‘his mates behaviour, he was just drunk’. He suggested we go back to the dance floor to get away from him but as we were walking, the ‘nice’ one grabbed our bottoms and then we lost him in the crowd. ,Ive been to multiple parties and seen subtle but detrimental behaviour on countless occasions such as a friend lying on the sofa sleeping and a guy suggested to the boy sitting beside her that this was a good opportunity to ‘give her one’. And they laughed. These ‘harmless’ jokes are precursors to truly horrific crimes like rape and assault. ,I have seen numerous men throw themselves on top of girls out in pubs or bars, complete strangers, sometimes without knowing or even talking to them first. They think it’s acceptable as everyone’s ‘drunk’ or they’re ‘just having fun’. Every single time the girl tells them to back off, voices that they’re uncomfortable and every single time it’s the girl having to adjust or change their behaviour by leaving.""",,

Afterwards he tells me to come meet him in the park, so I run there. I really liked him and the only experiences I had with men were a boy forcing me to give him head and a really sweet guy who just did stuff to me but was very sweet.

A boy I dated kept a list of girls names on his phone that he had got with or slept with. He showed me the list and he had ranked them all from ‘best to worst’ and written the amount of times he’d got with them. He pointed out the girls who he thought were better looking than me (they were older and popular so naturally I felt threatened) and made me feel like I had to prove I was worth his time which was completely messed up. He used the list as a way to emotionally manipulate me into doing stuff with him which I later really regretted and I have no doubt I’ve just ended up on that list like all the other girls.,,
"Just over a year ago, I was at my friends house after a party. Lots of people stayed the night after. I was sleeping and woke up to someone who i thought was my friend raping me. I froze and didn’t know what to do, everyone else was asleep. It was all very sudden and I only noticed a couple months after what had happened to me. I didn’t tell anyone until roughly 6 months after it happened. I still see the guy who rapped me, at school constantly and i want to speak up so badly but i’m scared. I felt so weak about not using my voice but it terrifies me that men are not held accountable as much as they should be. So I didn’t report it because i didn’t feel like it was worth going through the trauma all over again. I went on like nothing had happened and have only recently understood that i was at no fault in that situation. Women and girls are constantly asked what they were wearing or the context of the situation, to then victim blame us instead of evaluating the real issue that boys who rape or sexually assault girls, should be the only ones who should feel weak and disgusting.",,
"I'm a 14 year old boy and I was raped. I was out with friends and we were having a good time and there was alcohol involved. I got pretty drunk and one of my friends kissed me which I wasn't too bothered abkut as it was just one drunken kiss. But the second time I met her, I was once again drunk, and she proposed that we have sex. At first I was all for it, because I was drunk, but just before it happened I changed my mind. I told her I didn't want to and that I had changed my mind but she pulled me back and forced me to do it. I was distraught and kept trying to make it stop and even putting my clothes back on didn't help as she pulled them off. I'm not peticularly strong so there was nothing I could do. The worst part was that my mum walked in on us, and the look of utter disappointment on her face sent me into a massive panuc attack. Later on my sister assured me that everything was ok and that it was just a mistake that lots of teens make, but I didn't tell her that it was rape. Skip a couple weeks and I wasn't doing well at all. I had tried to tell my friends about it but ended up just saying that we kissed. And then they started accusing me of sexuall assault becasue i could've stopped her kissing me. And this rumour then developed within my school and now almost everyone is calling me a rapist. This all happened a few months ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I have no one to talk to or trust in or outside of school, but I know the rumour is only going to get worse if I don't say what really happened.

My freshman year I was walking through the hallway in my school. A group of a seniors and a few juniors started making comments about me which started off as compliments. I said thank you and went on with my day. The next week I walked past two of the the guys that were in the group. One of them was known for getting with freshman so I ignored them. When I walked past he grabbed my butt and pushed me into a locker. When I turned to say something before I could speak he called me a whore and his friend called me a passed around ass treesh. I was a virgin and still am. Never had a first kiss never dated anyone. Situations similar to this has happened to multiple girls of all grades. Nothing was ever done about it,,
"When I was 14, I was sexually assaulted by a boy who I thought was my friend. He tried to remove my clothes, and got his dick out and tried to force it on me. A few months later, at a party, I was pressured by literally dozens of boys from his school in a gang effort to make me forgive him because he ‘didn’t mean it’ and he was ‘a good guy’. I was then the subject of rape jokes for years after. He has lead a predatory existence ever since, behaviour which has always been excused by his school friends. It was a horrendous 'lad' culture - many of my friends have similar stories at the hands of these boys.",,

At school on Monday, I found out from reading messages between a girl (who was a close friend at the time) who was good friends with the boy that ‘he had done something bad’ (he literally wrote this in a message, therefore knew he did NOT have consent) and he had fingered me. I felt so violated and it’s taken me a long time process that it was assault.",,

He did not relinquish my space much but eventually, he moved to his own bed.,I was utterly exhausted and felt trapped.,I wasn't in a position to leave in the middle of the night, no where to go, no way to leave and would need to have the confrontation of leaving and trying to gather my work gear...,I turned my back to the wall and backed up, wrapped my sheets around me and pulled my pillow to my body to put a barrier. I just lay there in the dark.,I must have enthalpy drifted off.,Because I came round to the feeling of a hand under the sheet, on my chest, moving the sheets. I sat bolt upright and I'm pretty sure I said ""what the fuck"",He moved back very quickly and said ""we're late, we need to get up, was about to come wake you up"" (we weren't and I know what he was doing),I took my clothes and all my stuff and left the room and walked to the nearest general toilet in the bnb and got ready there.,I didn't even know how to broach the night as we were working together and staying alone for at least a week.,I didn't even get that far as he asked how I slept. I utterly panicked. My throat closed. I said I was out for the count due to my evening medication (usually this is true but I don't take it when working away and staying with anyone, male or female as it is a major risk to be on a strong sleeping medication (for migraine treatment)),I asked why he asked.,He said my phone went off a lot in the night and I should perhaps turn it off.,I said it was an emergency system designed to protect my home (I have a security alert system when away but it's often set off by neighbours and local foxes),I won't be turning my phone off at night.,It was clear I was on the back foot and not entirely sure what had played out.,He then asked if I'd be interested in us getting together at some point in the future.,I flatly said no thank you. I was not interested and was pretty sure I'd not given any indication that I would be.,We were stuck working together and staying together but I made up a story that my aunt was local and my niece was away so had offered me a room and I really wanted to see them.,I took my things and stayed there.,I told a friend what had happened and she was angry and furious.,I think I cried.,I still had work booked and it was likely we'd be working again together if the rota fell as it did.,I made arrangements to request separate rooms, each time I attended to find a shared room. (Due to some error, availability, cost etc. ),I did two more bookings, this time I brought a sleeping bag, left the room to change in a toilet somewhere in the hotel, and it clear I was now using a sleep tracker with camera on my phone, and also asked him to stop walking round in just his t shirt and pants.,I dealt with two more bookings and quit that agency as they wouldn't change the accommodation rule (and I didn't feel I was powerful enough or had enough proof to explain why and accuse him. If honest, I felt naiive and partially to blame for agreeing to the accommodation set up for him to do that. I also didn't call him on it at the time and I don't know why.,I certainly didn't want him on my bed, or his hands on me but I also don't know why I didn't shout fuck off. I felt terrified and alone and paralysed and stupid.,I no longer work that rota and similar bookings I always boom my own accommodation, at my expense when everyone else is covered but I'd rather lose money than share.,I still get flashbacks of not being able to move and still question how I was woken, what was he doing... was I overreacting, why did I say I'd taken my meds and was out... why did I not call him on it, why did he ask what my night was like knowing full well what he was doing.",,
"i have this guy friend who is in my class. since i’m in ninth grade now we have known eachother for about 3 years. he was such a sweet understanding guy until he started hanging out with the popular kids. i remeber the first time, it was in year seven. i was sitting in science with him and he started to touch my thigh. i pushed it off and didn’t think much because we were quite close at the time. over time it got progressively worse. in year 8 he would always touch me. i would tell him to stop but he wouldn’t listen. it got better though in year eight because i found out that he liked me. he became the once sweet and caring guy again just to win me over. i was dating someone at the time and i clearly didn’t have feelings for him and so i made it obvious. we completely stopped talking after that and honestly it ruined me. i don’t know why. it’s so hard, even when you know that the person had done something so wrong but you still can’t keep away from them. i’m in year nine now and he has become such a dick. we had this walking activity for this fundraiser and i was walking infront of his group of friends. i was minding my own business when all of a sudden from behind he said “yo, *my name* you look thicc asf today!” and the whole group started snickering and looking at me like hungry dogs. i was so embarrassed but i decided to put up with it. the other day we had clsss together and he was sitting next to me. he kept repeatedly touching me even after i had told him to stop. there you have it. i was sa by a classmate, in my own school. i didn’t think much but after putting two and two together i realised that it wasn’t normal. he has only done it to me and i feel so low because i have been there for the times when he has tried to commit etc and all i get is him literally sa me. it makes me sick because i feel like a puppet who is just used for his satisfaction. now he bullies me and the other day he wished for me to get gang raped by multiple black dudes. like wtf. i was so ashamed of what he has become. he said it infront of everyone. all the other girls and boys think he’s a sweetheart. but to me he is the puppet master and i am his puppet.",,
"at a once party when I was 14, I ended up getting really drunk and this boy friends kept telling me to go upstairs but I was so out of it I wasn’t really listening so he helped me upstairs where his friend was waiting in the bedroom. I don’t really remember much but I could feel it and see the blood when he was done",,
I was running around the field for soccer and boys just stared and started to cat call all of us.,,
I was 16 and passed out drunk on a guys shoulder at a party and after I passed out he came onto me and started kissing me and touching me - I only knew it happened when someone told me,,
I was blackout drunk. I didn't remember at first. I don’t even think he knows what he did and how he ruined my life.,,
When I was 17 I was manipulated into sending nude photos and videos of myself that I wasn’t comfortable with by someone in his 20s who also happened to be a secondary school teacher. When I turned 18 he came over to my house and ignored me when I told him I didn’t want to have sex. His response was ‘you wouldn’t have invited me here if you didn’t like me’. He then raped me. I didn’t realise it was rape until I spoke to a councillor months later but I still didn’t report it because I hadn’t explicitly said the word ‘no’ and I thought that meant no one would believe it was rape.,,
the school made it compulsory for us to wear leggings when we were wearing skorts/shorts that were part of the sports kits because apparently it was ‘too distracting for the male staff’ if we had our legs on show,,
I was just 15 on a camp for a week and had a thing with a 17 year old in the camp next to us. We'd get with at night in his tent and he repeatedly tried to convince me to let him take off my top and bra and finger me. When he had taken off my bra he wouldn't stop when I felt uncomfortable. I felt sick for months thinking about it.,,
Some boy in my year was texting me asking me to do explicitly things and then tell him about it. It really freaked me out so I told my friends word got back to him and he told all the boys that I was a liar and was just looking for clout and I had to block him on several social media’s as he consistently tried to contact me and tell me how I need to own up to lying and how I was making him sound like creep. Still now he tries to get me to say it was a lie and tries to do the same to many other girls,,
"We had a party night attended by the house master, perhaps even organised by the school. I was warned that myself and one of my roommates were going to be targetted by a couple of boarders from a different boarding house with date rape drugs. I wasnt aware such a thing existed and attended the party regardless. The only thing I now remember from the night is waking up in my own school bed with one of these blokes on top of me having full intercourse. I then passed out again. This was not a person i would have had consentual sex with. I did not consent. I was drugged. I was raped. I wish I'd reported it the next day but didn't know how to.",,
When Me and my friends from the age of 12-14 a group of boys in our year group would constantly walk up behind us grab our bums and slap them and rate them out of 10. It’s so gross because they would then go and discuss about it later when they were getting changed for p.e. We had told a teacher but then they just told us to ignore it because it’s boys being boys.,,
"My first boyfriend raped me when I was under the influence of alcohol and so I was very distrusting of men and their intentions afterwards. It took several months for me to grow close with the next boy I ended up dating. However, I was reluctant to have sex with him for obvious reasons but he always had a way of demanding or initiating a sexual situation whenever he wanted it and I would always argue against it and tell him I didn’t want to do anything. Generally we were in bad places that sex shouldn’t be happening. But he’d sulk and make me feel uncomfortable by being angry and upset with me until I gave in.",,
"when i was younger i used to love going to sleep at my nanas, i used to sleep over all the time i’d go for a weekend or more and come home but then she met this man which then became her boyfriend, he used to force me to draw him on my pictures and write cards to him. after a couple of times of me meeting him i thought he was nice but i was only 8 so i didn’t understand. i went to stay at my nanas house for a week in the school holidays and he sexually assaulted me several times during that week, i’ve never been able to stay over since even though he’s passed away. throughout primary up until year 6 i thought it was normal to be touched in your private areas.but ever since what happened i’ve had flash backs, sleepless nights and i just feel like it was all my fault i could of pushed him off me but i didn’t, i had this voice in my head telling me i should end my life so i tried, this voice told me not to eat so i listened, this voice told me to hurt myself so i did and this voice used to threaten me so i did what they said. i’m still scared now when i hear the voice or even when i get flash backs. i ended up suffering more with flash backs and voices in the lockdown (2020) and i didn’t want to leave my house nor my bedroom and now i’ve got to the point where i’m scared of any men i don’t know and i hate going in public spaces. i also self harmed more and tried ending my life. i wrote different suicide notes saying that i wanted to kill myself and i couldn’t live with these flashbacks and voices and i don’t like being told what to do when it’s not a nice thing, it’s all to much (and more) i hid them from my parents as i didn’t want to scare them in any sort of way and i never told my councillor until now",,
"Growing up, I was always slapped on my a**. It first happened in second grade, I had a classmate, he was special and he just groped me. My teacher, she saw, even him being special, we were sent to the principal. I was thankful that my principal was understanding, and made sure he never did again. But I cried after they were talking to me, I thought it was my fault. In fifth grade, there was this trend where they would slap each other’s back. It made me so uncomfortable because I hated myself in terms of my sexuality. So when I told them to stop, they didn’t. During summer, I was visiting my home country, I was with my cousin, walking to the store. When we were walking back home, a group of guys looked at me and kept murmuring stuff to one another. I asked my cousin who they were an she said to just ignore them, they just walked away, but kept looking back. I then asked her how old they were, she said they were about 10-16 and I immediately got so scared. I was only 11 at the time. Once we got home, - my house in that country is a two story, with huge gates in the front, it was only open when we were there - my sister and a bunch of kids were playing outside and I wanted to join in, so I did. When I looked back at the gate, the boys that I saw earlier was there creeping. They kept looking at me. So I went to my cousin again, and I told her they were there. Then she told me to never wear shorts and for the longest time I thought it was my fault at why they were looking at me. In sixth grade, I had a friend, I guess we were close, but then one day he just held onto my thigh and pinched it so hard that it caused a big bruise. In seventh grade, I was constantly slapped on the back. I kept telling them to stop, but they didn’t. When I tried telling my teacher, I was always disturbed by someone else. I was “dating” this guy, and one of his friends slapped me three times, even after I told him to stop. He almost caused a fight that day, but I was thankful that he tried to protect me. I’m only going to be a freshman next school year, and I’m terrified. If I had these experiences during elementary and middle school, what would high school be?",,
"""I was sexually assaulted and forced into sexual acts by my boyfriend when I was at college. I was 18, had not previously had a relationship with anyone. He ruined my life, by constantly forcing himself on me and forcing me to do things to him whilst inside the college building.,I found out that he was planning to rape me at this birthday dinner party for his guy friend. When I found out about this, he admitted his plans and felt like he deserved to have sex with me when he wanted because I was his girlfriend. I told him this was wrong, and he said he didn't care what I thought, and proceeded to assault me.,I tried to reach out for help, but nobody listened. He was disabled so he was protected and meant he was kept safe and avoided any bad action against him. I was thrown aside and socially outcast from everybody. It still hurts to this day, yet I have to act like it was nothing""",,
"I was 16 with very little experience with men. A boy in school started saying hi to me in the library, I thought nothing of it and carried on with my studies. On the evening that we finished our last GCSE the boy sent me about 25 snapchat videos explaining in detail how he would fuck me and rape me and that he knew where I lived and he would come to my house. He was drunk and his friends filmed him talking about my body and laughing about what he would do to me and sent me those videos too. I remember I felt paralysed and couldn’t leave the house for days afterwards.",,
I was at a party and everyone was lying in the living room some boy was asking to do stuff with me I said no several times he didn’t stop he continued to try and put his fingers in me while I tired to push him away we was surrounded by all my friend but nobody knew what was happening because there was music playing I typed what was happening on my phone and gave it to my friend who was sat next to me straight after he read it he pulled me over to him to get me away from the boy who was doing it to me he then stood up and stormed out the room swearing and shouting at me I then sat on the sofa crying my eyes out to my friend and nobody to this day only my boyfriend who I was with at the time and who I’m still with knows and the boy that helped me get away from him knows this happened in highschool which is the school I will list I’m now in college,,
r*ped 2 times by two different dudes,,
"I was sexually assaulted by a group of boys on a school bus. I was 11 years old at the time, and I was so confused by this event. I didn't understand it, because at the time, I felt as if it was my fault. I guess that's what years of being overly sexualised would do. I felt as if my body was a sexual object for men to do what they wish with and then leave. So I spent the next 3 years over sexualising myself, and getting rid of any man that treated me as if I was more than an object. Because i didn't understand why would someone want to know my favourite colour or what my favourite song is. And it wasn't till 4 years after the assault took place that I realised what they did to me. It was this overwhelming sensation of pain that spread through my entire body. I was so aware of where they had touched me, and what they said to me. Not only that but I realised all of the things that had happened to me over those 4 years. I was broken. And I did not deserve to feel like that. Those boys didn't just assault me, but they ruined my perception of my body and my worth.",,
"I am a survivor. I was talking to this older boy, he was 18+ and I was 14/15 at the time, we were chatting as had mutual friends in Facebook, and we met up I had barely had any attention from guys, so I was just craving the attention I was given. We were in the forest, secluded from anyone, and he forced me against my will to do things to him, and then he did things to me. I blamed myself for the longest time, but I know now that it wasn't my fault, J was young and naive, he should have known better.",,
"My boyfriend and I decided to drink one night. I was drinking tequila and he watched me drink about 4 glasses of it knowing how plastered I would be (because a few nights before I drank 1 cup and I was drunk) and he still decided to have sex with me I blacked out after laying down and remember waking up whole he was on top of me, inside me, and getting so mad and trying to push him off of me then blacked out again. After that I bled for 2 weeks straight. I’m not sure if it counts as rape because I “consented” even though I was drunk. But I felt like I was done wrong because I remember specifically telling him I didn’t want to have sex before we drank.",,
"My story is i was sexually assaulted in the 7th grade. At church i was grabbed and i still think about it day to day. at school i was sexually assaulted. The dress codes continue to grow worse dresscoding for the tiniest sliver of our shoulders. The guy teacher looking at me and my friend weirdly every day. things like this need to be heard.

"When I was 15 I went over to my female best friends house at the time, there were a few boys and girls there that I was meeting for the first time, it was also one of my first times drinking. My best mate got too drunk and passed out in her room. Another boy and girl were sleeping in another room. I was in one room as the only female with three boys. I passed out next to one boy and then later woke up to two of the three boys laughing and telling me that this one guy was in my pants and taking things further than I ever would’ve wanted. I was in tears whilst the boy who did it admitted it and the other boys were trying to comfort me. The next morning I told my best mate in tears to which she started clapping and telling me she was happy I went further, as I explained it wasn’t consensual which I thought was obvious she calmed down but still didn’t really care. She and everyone else remained friends with him for a long time after. I don’t believe this was the first time he had tried something like this, they did “warn me” that he becomes creepy when he’s drunk. Just another stupid excuse for disgusting behaviour.",,
"My boyfriend came inside of me for the first time (no protection) and he was able to control it before and so I asked why he wasn’t pulling out, and he replied with “I wanted to know how it felt”. At the time I was blinded and laughed about it I didn’t at all think this was a big deal until someone pointed it out to me. The next day I had to buy the morning after pill, not him.",,
"I started going out with this guy when I was 16 and he pressured me for nudes daily even though I said I didn't want to, then he would get pissed off at me and say I didn't trust him. Then because we did bits irl he then assumed I'd be up for sending him everything and still got pissed when I wouldn't",,
"I went on a date with a guy from my class, he put is head under my shirt to get a 'better look'. When I ran off he sent me several texts and then proceeded to come into the toilet stall I was in and sexually abuse me.",,

"""I was raped by a second year in my first year of uni. We lived in the same area of the country and had similar friends. All through the 1st semester he would be a little weird towards me, beg me to come home with him, repeatedly ask me what club I’m at and then leave the one he was in to join me etc. I made it very clear that I wanted nothing to do with him like that and he should stop. He then started to make my best friend feel very uncomfortable so I decided to completely cut him out. During the Christmas break, I was at a party at home and he was there, I tried my best to ignore him and enjoy my evening. I proceeded to get black out drunk, my friends from home tried to look after me and took me back to theirs, where he was staying with a group of other people. I woke up the next morning naked in bed with him, I don’t remember leaving the first bar so this alarmed me. I asked him what happened and he said to me “obviously we had sex, it was a long time coming” I felt physically sick and put my clothes back on, my knickers were still down by my ankles, and run up to my friends room. Everyone then proceeded to tell me that they were worried about me I was that drunk and I had multiple texts from friends asking me to call them when I woke up so they knew I was okay.,Everyone knew I was in no state to look after myself, let alone give consent to a boy who I had repeatedly turned down. I couldn’t shower or look at myself in the mirror for months as I felt so disgusting.,He started messaging me saying that if I told anyone he would deny it and that he was “embarrassed” and “seeing someone back at uni” so for my sake I should keep it between us. ,A year later I told my mum what happened and she explained to me that it was rape. I hope that anybody who relates to this story is brave enough to speak out and realise it is not your fault.""",,

"When I think about from aged 14 to aged 22 I’m horrified to remember how often I was sexually assaulted and my whole life I’ve felt it was my fault. I was raped by a friends boyfriend at 14 and from then, was followed by a stranger on a train, groped by two different doctors, flashed at in a swimming pool, assaulted on a double date with a friend, her boyfriend and his mate and locked in a room with a man whilst travelling. A boyfriend tried to have sex with me (and really did say ‘can I just put the tip in’). I realise now that one of the reasons I got married in my mid 20s was to stop the attention from others and to keep myself safe. I’m so pleased to be older now because it stops the constant barrage and I feel so sorry for teenagers now who have to deal with social media.",,

"There was this guy around a year or two ago and because of my account he expected me to send him nudes I had no idea who he was no mutuals or anything I was about 15-16 at the time and he was in uni. He started becoming really aggressive about it even though I’d never spoken or met this guy before in my life so I blocked him and he carried on making accounts and sending his nudes to me so he could say that he deserves them from me as well but I carried on saying no and blocking all the accounts he’d make and then he starting threatening to start telling my friends or just people in my year that if I didn’t send him anything he’d make up rumours and lie about me being a slut and all or how he’d make up the fact that I’d been in orgies with him and his friends which I don’t even know and they were all at least five years older at me at the time. It was more of the fact that just because I posted photos of my body because I’ve worked hard for it and finally after so many years feel confident about myself, boys and men feel that they deserve these types of things just because I post certain things on social media. And of course not to that extent but so many others do the same thing and think it’s ok as if it’s not degrading to me that all they see you as is just another girl who posts photos that they can wank off to or send it to friends so that they could rate my body and face from 1-10 in comparison to other girls in my year",,
I was touched at school by students and no one knows about It besides the people involved,,
"There’s this guy that always looks everyone up and down in our school, one time he kept bothering me saying that i looked good and stuff, I took as a compliment as one would do until he mentioned my thighs during class, he said to me in my face “I’m sorry but I just can’t stop looking at your thighs.” I looked at him with disgust and everything, when he asked me out to be his girlfriend I politely rejected him saying that he wasn’t my type and that I wasn’t rlly that comfortable being his girlfriend, after he found out that I got a girlfriend, he started showing me his scars, he told me that these scars were bc of me, he kept fucking cutting himself until I felt bad for him, tbh I did feel bad but I just didn’t think he would go this over a simple rejection, after I hanged out with him more often, he mentioned my thighs again, he kept trying to touch my thighs, he even told me that if I didn’t help him with his work he’ll just touch my thigh, he was a nice guy rlly, but like he was just super uncomfortable to be around, after I stopped hanging out with him he started making some stupid ass rumors saying that “oh she has a girlfriend” and some other homophobic ass shit, I told the principal abt it but she said all that she could was expel him, he came to school and started slapping girls asses looking at them up and down and just started being so damn weird, no one likes this guy a single bit, everyone thought he was so fucking weird.",,
"When I was 16 I asked a guy I knew if he was going to be out that night at the pub. We had been intimate before in the past but it ended on a strange note and I wanted to see if I could clear the air, hence asking if I would be seeing him. When I got there, he asked to go on a walk around the area and I agreed- it was an opportunity to talk things out and establish a friendship with no awkwardness. After literally one or two minutes of walking down the street he started grabbing me by the waist to pull me in and I immediately pulled away and he proceeded to carry on, despite me saying stop it and get off me. He was not hearing me. I had to tell him that no means no, like he was a child. I went straight home after walking silently with him back to the pub. I felt disgusted and unsafe and I know he didn’t think twice about it afterwards. The worst part is that for a while I felt like it was my fault for wanting to go on a walk to talk about things, as if asking for that is like asking for him to do what he did. For so long I brushed it off because I thought I was asking for it and that I was being dramatic.",,
"Outside [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] station usually in the morning, I can never pass the entrance without getting catcalled at least 5 times, one time i was physically assualted, and cat called 6 times by different men whilst i was waiting outside starbucks for around 5 minutes.

"Throughout the whole of my time at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I never heard of any male on female sexual assault. However, the female on male sexual assault happened alarmingly often. My friends and I had our arses slapped and touched often in school, despite making it obvious that we were uncomfortable with it. I had my penis grabbed by a girl at a drink up completely out of the blue and very much without consent, and even had my costume ripped open numerous time to reveal my body at a Halloween party which made me incredibly uncomfortable.",,
"""Quite simply: when I was 14 I posted a completely normal photo on insta, fully dressed and not sexual in any way (also looked about 12 when I was 14, had no boobs) and boys tagged each other in it and commented ‘let’s fuck her’.,I clearly didn’t care at the time as I found this comment a few months ago after forgetting about it. The fact that I didn’t bat an eye lid shows the control these (popular) boys had and how saying ‘lets fuck her’ on my social media seemed acceptable and normal. Many of my own friends and other boys liked their comment. This may seem very small- and yes I didn’t get upset about it at the time, but I’m mortified about how I must have been sexualised at a young age at school: I had also been choked as a joke in the dining room and slapped on the bum multiple times which I did get upset about, and if I said something like ‘don’t touch me’ I was laughed at.""",,
Some friends and I were sitting in the school yard and I was on my male friend’s lap. Our relationship was totally platonic but when he saw the boy I had been flirting with walk past he held me down by the hips and mimed ejaculating. At the time I laughed awkwardly while trying to stand up and move. The other friends called him out for being “really weird”. I moved to sit elsewhere and we continued talking as if nothing had happened. Invasions of personal space were so frequent and normalised I didn’t think much of it.,,
"I was very drunk at a party and my ex-boyfriend (who knew I still had feelings for him) took me upstairs to his bedroom, got with me and gave me lines of ket.

I felt truly violated and embarrassed. Still feel ashamed today.",,
"I am 19 and I got raped when I was 17. I was at my own house, hosting a party for my birthday. I had invited around 40 people, and as the night went on, more people from my school turned up and came in. That night, I started to get with a boy who I’d known for years, he was in the year above and I really liked him. He was with me most of the night, but went home around 12. However, throughout the night, another boy that I didn’t invite was following me around, touching me on my bum, asking to kiss me, touching my boobs. I tried to laugh it off and curve him and move away, but somehow he always found me. Late into the party when I was fairly drunk, I went up to my room to get something, and he must of seen me go up and he followed me. He came into my bedroom and forced me on my knees, shoving his penis in my face. At this point I froze, I was too drunk to consent even if I wanted to (which I didn’t) and so the rest is blank. I do remember him raping me, and ejaculating inside of me with no protection, or asking if I was on the pill (I wasn’t). After he was done with me, he left, and went back downstairs without saying anything and I was left alone. I called my friends to come up and help me after a while once I’d processed what happened and they shut down the party and cried with me in the bathroom. I called the boy I got with earlier that evening and he told me it was my fault, and he never wanted to see me again. I cried down the phone trying to explain and he hung up on me. The next day I had to go to the pharmacy to get the morning after pill, and that was very embarrassing and degrading trying to explain what happened as it was so fresh. I pretend like this event didn’t happen and I don’t tell anyone, but in all honesty it’s destroyed me. I think about it all the time, it makes me feel like I never want to have sex again, even with my loving boyfriend of 2 years. Because he went to my school, everyone was still friends with him, I saw him at parties and cried all night, even after I told one of his closest friends what happened, she still was good friends with him til this day. I’ve blocked him on every social media platform, and i wish I had the courage to share this on my own social media, but I’m still embarrassed, I still know people would talk and take his side and that’s too hard for me.",,
"3 years ago when I in year 11 I was sexually abused for about a year by a boy in my year in class and at some parties. I was raped one time and assaulted in front of teachers and kids in school many times. Nobody spoke out at the time or stood up to him and I felt so alone. I didn't tell anyone for about a year and when I did, it felt like my teachers didn't believe me. The police took our statements but they couldn't do anything because there was no evidence, even though he had admitted to raping and assaulting me to loads of people. My teachers tried to tell me that it was just banter. When we were moving into college and sixth form, he wanted to move somewhere else. When he told the school he was going to college they assumed it was because people knew about what he did and they gave him another month to see if he wanted to stay for sixth form even though I wanted to be at sixth form with my friends. It felt like they believed him more than me and I wasn't wanted so I dropped out for a year and I started college a year later than everyone else. I'm behind on everything compared to other people my age and the way my school and police didn't help made me lose all my confidence. I feel like my life was destroyed by it and I can't talk about what happened to people at college because I lost my trust in everyone and I lost all my friends.",,
"I remember when I was in year 9, I turned around to see one of my male teachers staring at me and smiling weirdly and forever after that i felt really uncomfortable around him. He did this more than once.",,
MALE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT SPOKEN ABOUT ENOUGH - I was afraid to say anything to anyone after my gf forced me to have sex while at a sleepover with her when I clearly said no and that I love her but I don’t want to have sex and wanted to fall asleep. I felt that people would think I was being stupid but really it made me feel horrible after because I loved her and she made me feel so rubbish for refusing to have sex with her so I gave in after she kept physically forcing me to.,,
"i got sexually and mentally harrased and assaulted by a fellow student it was in sight of teachers and cameras so how no one knew i dunno but the schools support isn’t helpful and i don’t know who to tell i feel guilty as i was told by him i told him multiple times to stop this behaviour and he never did,it’s bring memories up from the past that i don’t want to think about and i want help and support",,
"Today is the 12th July 2021 and I met a boy on Snapchat who lived in my area ; so we decided to hang out , we met at the park near our area which also had a skatepark , this boy was a skater and we sat under the ramps , he put his arm around me like I thought awh he’s cute so I snuggled up to him he kissed me so I thought oh so I should just kiss him , he then started moving his hands towards my area , I said I didn’t want to but he said ‘ it would be fun ‘ he then started using his hands near my area it was sore I asked him to stop he said ‘ i want to see you c*m ‘ he then whipped out his area pulling my hands towards it , I said I didn’t want to and he said ‘ I did something to you , you do something to me ‘ so he started pushing my hand round his dick and controlling my hands so I was wan*ing him off , I reallly didn’t want too. He then lifted me on top of him both of us ‘ half naked ‘ and put his d**k inside me I said I didn’t want this since I was uncomfortable and we had only just met today but he said he wants to have sex since he hadn’t in a while , bearing in mind this was outside so my area was covered in mud and stuff after him doing all of that to me , he then proceeded to say ‘ I’ve gotta go home now ‘ and I just cried my whole way home it’s 4 hours since he’s left and I can’t sit down it’s so sore it kills",,
I came out as bi to a few people at my all girls school in year 10 maybe . And these 2 popular (straight ) girls used to shout my name and then pretend to get off or grab each other’s tits to make me feel uncomfortable. So humiliating.,,
"I was raped whilst on holiday in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] by a British male. I didn’t feel I would be believed even if I reported it so didn’t. It’s tough and it stays with you, I think about it every day without fail . It was five years ago.",,
"I'm in year 8 and there is a boy in my school, ever since year 7 he has been terrorising me and my friends. He sexually assaulted one of us and keeps talking to us. He hasn't done anything to me personally but now whenever I'm around him I get really uncomfortable and I'm just waiting for him to do something to me.",,
"I was blackmailed into sexual acts with a boyfriend who also attended the school, he touched me inappropriately infront of mine and his friends.",,
"After a party this boy somehow convinced me and some friends to go back to his house. He started pressuring me into doing shots and doing way more than anyone else, he then did the same with drugs. He started trying to kiss me so I did once to be polite. I don’t remember anything after that, I woke up in his bed in the morning he was in just his pants and I was in a bra and my jeans. My jeans were zipped up and the button was done up so from this I hoped that meant he hadn’t taken them off. But apparently he took photos of me asleep.",,
my technology teacher raped me.,,
"my friend stayed over at my house after a party. we were in bed and i was ready to sleep when i realised that they were fingering themselves next to me. i didn’t know what to do or say. a few minutes later they reached over and touched my boobs, i froze. i lie still for about 20 minutes while this continued, but i asked ‘why are you doing this’ and they said ‘because i can’. then they tried to put their hand down my pants and i told them to stop and that it was hurting, but they didn’t stop. they then grabbed my hand and tried to get me to touch them and i said i didn’t want to, but they weren’t stopping so i gave in for a few minutes because i thought maybe if i gave them what they wanted they would stop. they didn’t.,about a year and a half ago one of my friends pointed out my twacher was flirting with me. i was shocked; i was really close with this teacher and i thought how we were speaking was very normal. it made me begin to evaluate every interaction we had. it began to feel weird when they would come into my other lessons to sit next to me and tell me how they missed how close we used to be and how we used to be together. a few months later they ended up assaulting me too. i felt so guilty for thinking anything wrong of it, because they were my friend who had supported me for years. after that they began making more blunt sexual comments and advances that i couldn’t even deny the inappropriateness of. over months i started to think about the past few years of my life and realised so much has occurred. i reported it. i began having flashbacks from when i was younger and realised it was so wrong all along. supposedly i was groomed. idk.",,
"In my school, there were a group of boys in my year group playing a game called Smash, Marry, Kill. The people they were mentioning were the girls in our class. They said they wanted to marry my best friend, kill the other and 'smash me'. They constantly make sexual jokes at me even if I tell them I am uncomfortable or not. Told the teachers about it and they said was ""Oh next time, tell them off right in front of our faces rather than hiding! it will make you seem so strong"" (???). They always stare at my ass and I have been covering up more, it only stopped because my brother threatened to beat them up lol.",,
"i was sexually assaulted by someone i thought at the time was one of my best friends. i was extremely drunk and incapable of consent and she was sober, i thought i could trust being around her in such a vulnerable state but i was clearly wrong. the morning after i was in shock and felt violated when i realised that something had happened and pushed it back in my head and tried to ignore it as much as possible. she has also done this to two other girls of my knowledge in similar circumstances. coming to terms with being assaulted has taken nearly a year to process and i continued being her friend because i was afraid to acknowledge what she’d done to me and i was so worried about her mental health despite the discomfort i felt around her. we were on and off friends for years due to her being mentally abusive and manipulative. she always used her mental health as an excuse and constantly manipulated and gaslighted my friends and i for years causing damage to our mental health’s. i finally came to terms with what happened in the second lockdown shortly after she gaslit me for the last time and started telling my friends who have supported me so much",,
"School was good in year 7 however later declined just before I realised I wasn’t straight. Verbal comments had already started regarding my sexuality and other personal traits. The torment worsened as more and more people began taunting me daily with different slurs or gestures. Year 11 I was cornered in the bathroom by two other guys where they taunted to be again gesturing to one of their penises laughing as if it was funny whilst I was terrified. I didn’t feel safe at school after that and had nightmares bout how it could’ve turned out if I hadn’t of pushed my way out in time, leading to me leaving the school at the end of the year my only way of escape from my constant fear placed on me since that day.",,
my first time i asked if they had a condom and they said no so i said can we not have sex but then he had gotten on top of me and started to fuck me and it was extremely painful and i was clearly not enjoying it but he kept going till he finished and then got up and left,,
"I had sex this one time with a boy and it was awful, he emotionally manipulated and embarrassed me countless times making me feel so small and helpless. Stupidly, I agreed to see him again because in my mind I was going to regain my power and show him who was boss this time. OBVIOUSLY that didn’t happen. I actually developed thrush from the last time he *violently* penetrated me, so explained this to him and told him to go slowly to begin with (also me being young and not knowing that u should probs just lay off the sex when u have thrush, cus of the pain) He then proceeded to RAM it in me with extreme force, I’ve never felt so much pain in my life, but I was too scared to show it because I KNOW he would have made fun of me. I kept telling him to slow down but he wouldn’t listen, until i shoved him back a bit a couple of minutes later. It then turned out that I was bleeding (I wasn’t on my period) I was bleeding because of the force he was penetrating me with the combination of thrush which I told him was painful. He then got angry at me because I got blood on his bedsheets and on him as if it was MY FAULT. So I then proceeded to wash the blood off for him while he made nasty remarks. I was SO embarrassed and apologetic, because he made me feel as if I’d done something wrong. It took me a year to realise that HE had caused the bleeding, not something that happened with me, I was convincing myself I had a fluke period. He decided he didn’t want to continue having sex with me after I was bleeding so instead he “taught me how to give a proper blow job”. I’m so mad and sad I went along with it all at the time, but I was so out of my depth and had no control. This was a year ago and I haven’t had sex with a single person since, my skin crawls with the thought of it. I’m worried I won’t be able to experience a loving relationship where I feel able to have sex with someone. And the worst part is he has continuously asked me out for drinks and made me feel bad when I say no, like calling me names and saying I’m being moody and cold.",,
A teacher put his head in my breasts and he still works at the school they did nothing,,
This guy who is friends with one of my friends came up to me when I was walking out of school to go home and he was shouting in front of everyone that it’s my friends job to f**k me and that if my friend doesn’t he will f**k me instead and since that day he kept saying horrible things about me which made my mental health worse than it already was and he caused me to start cutting myself again after being 2 years clean.,,
"This is my second testimony about something different, there was this boy called [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], and he was my ex boyfriend, we dated when we were very young but I still classed him as an ex because I was in love with him and everyone I would see him I would get butterflies, when he came back to school in year 9, and I finally saw him after not seeing him for nearly a year, I fell back in love with him, a month or so went past since I fell back in love with him and he messaged me on Instagram regarding a fight is been in that day, he just said you got beat up by ____ and I just said lol no, we had spoken before that a few months before because a person was going around saying we were dating, we cleared it up and the fact that I wasn’t saying anything and that was that, we then started talking for a while, I added him on snap and we talked and played games and joked and had deep chats for a month and 2 weeks, it wasn’t always good tho because after very conversation we had I knew he would never like me and I would never be good enough /TW/ I started to self harm in the first week we started talking, because of well lots of different things ( abusive mum ,him and ex best friend), it wasn’t bad at first just little scratches with a knife here and there, a lot happened with this boy [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and I won’t bore you with the details but he broke my heart, and the self harming just got worst from there a few months after this , me and my two best friends fell out because of one of their current boyfriends, I was so upset then and the self harming just continued to get worse, a month later ish, I tried to overdose in the school bathroom whilst skipping science, my ex girlfriend who now bullies me walks in and calls me a scruffy bitch and says she will wait outside, I ran out , crying, went to another bathroom and threw up, its been around a year now since I started self harming and I’m completely broken, I have good days and bad but mostly bad, I’m currently 6 days clean after relapsing twice on a month but there we go, I’m trying to get better and out everything behind me and I’ve even made a new best friend, this is some of my story I suppose ( I have an eating disorder because of my ex girlfriend, depression and anxiety because of [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and trust issues because of my ex best friends)",,
"My boyfriend at the time (year 9/10) used to sit me on his lap in our form room in front of everyone with his hands under my shirt and bra often humming the jaws theme tune as he approached my boobs or crotch followed by “lad points”. At the time I thought it was totally normal and didn’t complain, nor did anyone in the room comment on how strange this was. Looking back it was pretty creepy to give yourself points for touching your girlfriend in a room full of people.",,
"i was at a house party and a boy, very clearly drunk, walked in and stumbled in front of me. i politely said hi then he lurched towards me and grabbed my boobs. i pushed him off and legged it but i then heard that he went on to do the same to over half a dozen girls that night. wasn’t extreme but incredible uncomfortable",,
We were having sex and I was in excruciating pain and when I asked him to stop whilst crying and trying not to scream he wouldn’t,,
"I took a shower like I do everyday and once I stepped out of it I was about to brush my teeth without wearing a towel or anything because then I had believed that my home was a safe place. It was nighttime and my lights were on meaning my side profile and silhouette could be seen. Then I looked out the window and there was this man watching me from the crack of his window. I stepped back so he couldnt see me, as I realised he could see me, my naked body, without any form of consent, he was a stranger. Once I looked back again his loghts were off I couldn't see him anymore.",,
"I got with my boyfriend when I was 13 he was two years above. He was questioning his sexuality at the time but didn’t want the guys in his year to know. I was ok with this and supportive. We first had sex when I was 14 he was 16. I wanted to use a condom but accidentally broke it, he told me I was stupid and that it doesn’t count if we use a condom. We had unprotected sex. It was uncomfortable. He then told me I was stupid and made me to leave. Apologised 7 years later and said ‘yeah I knew I was gay, I just needed to make sure...’’",,
"One dress up day, I think it was World Book Day maybe when I was in Year 8, I was passing through a corridor when another teacher was walking down in the opposite direction past me. However after he passed, I noticed in a reflection of the windows he turned around to look back at me and he was looking directly at my skirt area around my bum and he smirked to himself. For the next 3 years I stayed at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I felt super I uncomfortable around this teacher and I actually had him teach me history, when and where he would often make suggestive comments after the incident.",,
"I had been dating a guy a year older than me for a few months when one day he decided he didn’t wanna wait. I shouted and screamed and tried to get him off me but he wouldn’t leave me alone. He sexually assaulted me in my own bedroom and I couldn’t stand the sight of it for weeks, the sight of it made me sick and unsafe. He said he’d lie if i told everyone and say that i was making it up for attention so i never said anything.",,
in y9 a new boy moved to our school and he was pretty quiet so nobody really took any special notice of him. one day i was walking home from school and i called by the shops and he started following me back. i lived really close to the shop so i was nervy about him knowing where i lived so i cut a corner and he carried on following me. i eventually saw a group of boys i knew (but wasn't particularly close with) and just walked over in hope he would leave me alone. he then caught up and started grabbing my arms and moving down to my skirt. the other boys didn't do anything about it. after a few months i eventually confronted my head of year and she told him to apologise and i was told to forgive him. it was like when you fall out with a friend in primary.,,
"This is the third testimony I’m sharing. Most women don’t have just one experience. When I was 14 in the 1990s I went to a club night for under 18s (or 16s I don’t remember). Everyone was looking to snog someone, eventually I started kissing a boy in a dark seating area. I don’t know how old he was but he can’t have been a dissimilar age. He then started making me touch his penis. I wasn’t comfortable with it and tried to stop. He then started forcing my head into his lap. At this point I was like “no way” and got up to leave, he was pulling my arm but I left. I told my friend and it was like “whatever, this is to be expected”. What I’m mad about years later is that us teenage girls had already been exposed to rape culture enough to be accepting of it as the norm.",,
it was my first day of year seven and i laughed at a boys joke and he said shut up or i’ll rape you,,
"At a party containing only people from my school, while I was kissing one guy, at least three others groped me. I did not report it as I knew that the guys at my school would only laugh at me, call the guys who did it “complete lads” and/or not believe me at all. I left the school.",,
When I was in school this one guy would always grope me and give me sexualising nicknames. I thought it was normal for girls to have to deal with that but now I'm older I know how wrong it was. It made me uncomfortable and I didn't know what to do so I just dealt with it for 5 years.,,
"In our school there’s sexualising the way we dress, because it ‘distracts the male workers’, removal of jewellery because it’s distracting and inappropriate, this school takes away our ability to express ourselves without harm to anyone else, but the school claims they’re all about expressing ourselves in any way we want.",,
"I was assaulted when I went out with friends. I wasn’t wearing anything revealing, I was just out to have fun and make memories with my friends. A guy came up to me and kept trying to talk to me so I was polite but moved away from him with my friends. We went to a different room in the building, he followed. It started getting really loud, it was impossible to hear what anyone was saying and me and my friends were still near each other but not right next to each other. The guy came over to me and started trying to get me to leave with him, I kept saying no but he kept trying. Everyone around me was so distracted and he sexually assaulted me, in a room full of people.",,
"One day me and my friend (also a girl) were standing, leaning against a table just minding our own business when one of the boys in our class crawled under the table and started looking up our skirts. Two teachers where in the room and instead of reprimanding the boy they got angry at me and my friend for ‘letting’ him look under our skirts. I was 7.",,
"When i was 14 i got into a sexually, emotionally and physically abusive relationship. he would coerce and ridicule me when i did not want to have sex with him. he would kick me out of his bed as a punishment and told me that i had to walk home, i would eventually give in and let him use my body for his pleasure. he did not understand that saying no meant no - and not convince me. it made me feel dirty and useless; i saw my body in the mirror after a shower; covered in hickeys that he had given to me without my consent, and i would cry and feel like i had nowhere to turn. i had no friends or support to go to and i felt like i deserved this. when i finally broke my silence to one of his friends, he had told me that my (ex)boyfriend was going through things at the time so i should be supportive and lenient, as if i wasn’t going through things? this made me even more embarrassed to come forward, especially because there was no proof it was happening to me. when i had told him that he had sexually assaulted me and had raped me a few times he denied it ever happening and gaslit me into believing i HAD wanted it and did enjoy it. this definitely was not the case. now, 6 months after i ended our 20 month relationship, i see him at school and i instantly am sent back to that time and have a panic attack. i have not been diagnosed and i do not want to self diagnose but i think i have some type of ptsd from my experience. i have finally told my friends and my mum, they have all been nothing but supportive and wonderful. however, he is allowed to still walk free and have friends and girlfriends?? i do not see how this is fair, especially because when i came forward to a teacher whom i trusted they gaslit me and told me that i was making a big deal out of nothing and was upset for losing a relationship. i have been given minimal support and i don’t see how this is fair. i struggle with depression and severe anxiety and i do not see why i should have to suffer this alone, or how men and boys like that can get away with treating women and girls like this.",,
"When I was 14 I got drunk for the first time around my mum and some family friends. When a few too many had hit me and I felt sleepy a family friend who was in his 30’s, married with 2 children, said he’d put me to bed in his daughters bed as she was at a friends house. That night he sexually assaulted me. For a long time I struggled with the whole experience and believed it was my fault. I send love to all of those affected.",,
"When I was in 2nd Grade I was playing with my friends hide and sick, so I decided to hide in the school's bathroom (it is both for girls and boys). When I went in, an older boy pushed me inside and locked the door. Then he asked me to suck his p*nis and he said that I was ""sick"" and the medecin was inside it. I didn't believe him so I started screaming and I heard a teacher. He immediately left. I'm not sure if this is rape, but I really wanted to share this. I was too scared and ashamed that this happened, so I didn't tell anyone, not even my parents.",,
"In the school halls all the boys would catcall the girls. I didn’t think much of it until they started to get physical. They would slap girls on the ass and on the chest. They would grab us and pull us aside. If we fought back they would turn the story on us and the school would dismiss it because there was “no real evidence”. I was sexually assaulted by someone at this school. I fought back and the story was turned on me. it happened over and over again for the next year and a half. Sexual abuse and assault is not a joke. If you see something say something. As for the school district, do better.",,
I was sexually assaulted by a group of boys from my year when I was 14 during early 2000s. This was my first sexual experience; I had never even kissed anyone. I received misogynistic bullying throughout my time there. A boy once flashed me in a classroom in front of other pupils who laughed about it. A builder who had been working at the school followed me home trying to coerce me and chat me up. Teachers turned a blind eye; basically blamed me and made the problem worse rather than better. When I misbehaved and started failing at school due to my distress at the situation nothing was questioned (I had always been conscientious and well-behaved before.) I ended up being suspended and falling into drugs and being groomed by a drug dealer in his 30s when I was 15. Several teachers were since sent to jail for sexual relationships with under age girls. There was a toxic culture of misogyny and sexism that both the teachers and pupils fully participated in.,,
"I was in year 8 when this happened. I was with a group of friends (boys and girls) when one of the boys decided to sexually assult me, although there had been many story’s from girls saying that he had done this in the past when I came to them crying and spoke up about it - none of the boys belived me and passed me off as an attention seeker. This lead me to believe maybe what happened wasn’t what I thought it was and that he wasn’t in the wrong and I was. Three years later and I’m only just coming to terms that what he did wasn’t my fault and that even the boys who shrugged at the time should be held accountable in some way, as they contributed to the emotional trauma that I went through",,
"I was 11 when I was sexually assaulted by my brothers school friends. They were 13/14 at the time, it was in my bedroom. They would leave my brother with another person in the room (he never knew and I have never told him). They would make me touch myself in front of them at first and it eventually ended with one of them anally penetrating me. I have never told anyone and doubt I ever will. I am now 30 years old and live with this everyday. I am too scared to go back to where I grew up in case I see any of them.",,
"I was continually sexually assaulted by my partner, my friends watched the spark die in my eyes and did nothing to help. Even the teachers that go involved did nothing long term. I now have ptsd",,
When I was younger my dad actually had raped me while my mum was at working and I had nobody to go to and I thought it was a normal thing for a father to do to you and he would abuse me and rape me almost every night.,,
I met this guy at a house party and we slept together and he seemed nice so I met him another time. The second time he kept trying to get me to stay even after I told him to leave but I just took it as him flirting bc he was very sweet and made me dinner and we didn’t sleep together that time. The next time he came to my house and we made dinner again - on the way to the shops he kept touching me in ways I didn’t like and I told him this and batted him away again I just thought he was flirting so I brushed it off. When we were back at my house we were kissing on my bed and he was on top of me. He overstepped a boundary I wasn’t ok with so I asked him to stop. He held me down and kept kissing me and touching me in ways I didn’t like. I kept asking him to stop and he didn’t do the situation escalate later and I had to resort to shouting at him and pushing him off before anything more serious happened. I texted him the next day saying he had over stepped my boundaries and he didn’t reply. Only a year later he was featured in my friends magazine so I brought the issue up to me friend. Only then did he message me and all he said was ‘if you have a problem with me can you tell me now bc I’m just trying to live my life’ the lack of understanding or remorse for the way he acted only further upset me based on his past actions - I could tell he didn’t care about what he did he just didn’t want it to affect his reputation,,
Not being allowed to wear strappy tops in summer to school because it ‘shows our shoulders’ or having to wear a specific length of a skirt. At an all girls school. Who for?? The male teachers??,,
"during school one day i got sat next to this boy in a welsh lesson and i pushed it aside but like around thirty minutes into the lesson he started touching my thigh and i asked him if he could stop, but he said no and was bringing it up higher and i was still telling him to get off but then he tried to finger me and i got up and left, he wouldn't leave me alone during school time or alone, he would continue to snap me and ask me for nudes even though i would say no he then proceeded to grab my boobs and ass in school and i would tell him to stop but he would call me difficult.",,
"I was raped by a childhood friend after a night out, I was so drunk I could barely walk and he was stone cold sober. We came back to my house and were chatting and then he initiated it and after I while I started to realise that I wasn’t comfortable with what was going on so told him that we should probably stop, he ignored me and continued even though I continuously repeated we should stop. I was so uncomfortable that he had to push so hard that I was bruised the next day and it was very painful. I rubbed it off as nothing because I thought a friend would never do that and it wasn’t until months later that it came crashing down when I realised I had a fear of any sexual contact at all and I saw that he’d let his friends sexually assault me at parties while I was drunk. I’m slowly starting to move on but I feel that guys will never understand the lifelong trauma that comes with being assaulted.",,
They didn’t care he was younger then my how could a innocent boy do what he did I was ignored and the school shrugged it off,,
I was 11 he was 18 he had just left the school i was walking home it was around 4pm he came up to me i thought he was being kind so i asked him if i could help he said yes and i asked him with what he then took my hand and pulled me someone more secret he said he was lost i asked where he need to go he then asked me if i could take him somewhere i can’t remember where but then he asked me to sit on his lap i said no he stated shouting at me to sit on him lap i stupidly gave in and par on his lap he started saying someone really creepy things then started to move his and around my face moving down to my b00bs i asked him to get of he didn’t and kept going down that’s when i jumped on him lap and ran to the place with the most people,,
"My school has always had a problem with rape culture, constantly pushing about skirt length etc HOWEVER somthing that happened around two years ago when i was in year 8 has really stuck in my mind today after discovering this page. We were in PE all sitting in the hall in our lines (for context, most girls wear skorts - little tennis skirts with tights shorts underneath) when a teacher made an announcment to us. she said that if we were doing trampolining or gymnastics in our PE lessons (lessons taught by male teachers at the time) we were supposed to wear shorts because - AND I QUOTE “skorts may be distracting to the male teachers”. i have made joking tiktoks etc about this event but it has really stuck in my mind recently and thought it needed to be talked about. we cannot allow young girls such as myself to develop a mindset where our clothing and attitudes are blamed for the intentions and actions mem may think about and then persue. these types of heavy statements are what molds young minds into this mindset and it’s very hard to undo. we have to stop this at the source!",,
"My ex-boyfriend used to grope me in lessons and pressure me to touch him under the table. He later pressured and coerced me to give him head and sleep with him, the latter of which I resisted. I did not feel comfortable even mentioning it to a teacher, even when I was having flashbacks and panic attacks as a result of this. Nothing was done when he and his friends spread rumours about me slut-shaming me, even though this was very audible and noticable",,
"I was sexually assaulted many times in my school. I always thought that it was okay because all I heard since I was little was “boys will be boys” and I thought what the boys were doing to me was ok when in reality it was not. I’ve had people smack my butt at least 100 times since I’ve came to this school. I’ve had people purposely touch my breast because I thought that that was ok, I THOUGHT THAT WAS OK!?!!? What is wrong with me?!?!? I’ve never told anyone because no one ever believes me or if I do they say that I’m lying and that I’m a liar and no one will ever believe me because I lie so much. I kinda feel like it my fault; It’s my fault. Some guys in my school will literally send me unsolicited duck pictures without my consent and then they will demand that I send then bevsuse they send me one for free!!?!?!?!???? Ive had people kiss me and touch my body and say “oh it doesn’t matter because you’re fat no one will like you”. IF I WAS SMART ENOUGH THEN THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED TO ME…..maybe? IDK. IM SO LOST 😞. I CANT ESCAPE IT. 😔",,
Being touched and groped by other boys and know many girls who have been treated the same or been assaulted sexually in some way,,
"All of the testimonies I have read have been from students, but the problem of misogyny is far wider. I am a teacher at a large and well-known north London comprehensive. While teaching a virtual lesson a couple of months ago I received abusive messages from a pupil in my class, who had managed to circumvent the system and login using an anonymous username. I received numerous lewd messages, including, “ur a milf”. A couple of weeks later, again teaching online, I received anonymous threats from a pupil saying, “I will stab you”, “I will kill your entire family”. “It’s not gonna be funny when I leak your address online”, “fat bitch” and “whore”. They also posted a photo of me that they had found online, saying, “I know your face”. I received in the region of fifty messages, the whole time trying to retain compose while trying to teach a live lesson. Now that school has returned nothing has happened and I have to teach the class several times a week. I did report it, but a month later nothing has happened. Because the pupil is a teenager it hasn’t been taken seriously (by police, who I reported it to, or school) and I am sickened that misogynistic abuse is so widely tolerated.",,
We had been ‘linking’ for over a month and he would always bring up the idea of giving him head but i always said no. his hands would always try go under my pants even when i said no but i still let it happen. i hated the way he said ‘relax’ and ‘please’ because i felt i had to do it. one time i initially consented to give him head and he took out his phone and started recording me which i didn’t realise until his flashlight went on. i think i was in shock because i have no idea what happened next and i didn’t think to check if he actually deleted it when he said he did. it makes me sick to think that happened and i felt so powerless in that moment. he only reason he said sorry was because his friend asked why i wasn’t sitting with him anymore.,,
A boy grabbed my vagina in the school playground. This was in primary school.,,
"This experience isn't about rape but about sexual harassment and assault. It happened or is currently happening in a small town in Indiana. It all started in 6th grade when in my P.E. class I would catch guys staring at me and someone had told one of my older friends that they were talking about my body in inappropriate ways. It continued all year and I couldn't do anything about it because I had no proof. In 7th grade someone took a picture under my skirt without my consent and sent it to a few boys around the school. One of those boys showed me the picture and told me not to tell but I did. The next the boy who told me about the picture told everyone what happened and possibly even showed them the picture. I never felt safe at my school again after that. In 8th grade guys would touch my butt in the hallways constantly and shrug it off as an ""accident"" I couldn't do anything about that either because I knew none of the guy's names or what grade they were in. My school probably wouldn't have done anything anyways.",,
"An old friend who sat next to me in class in year 10 would keep touching my genitals through my trousers even though I told him to stop. They made me keep it a secret, otherwise they threatened to tell everyone that I was LGBTQ+ which they did anyway. They also tried to pull down my underwear whilst getting changed for PE, making me uncomfortable. The teachers did nothing.",,
I was walking through the halls when this Junior who’s 18 came up to me and grabbed my ass. this went on for a few weeks. and when i told my school they didn’t do anything about it. (freshman),,
"Second year at university and started seeing this guy quite seriously. I woke up multiple times to him fingering me while I was completely asleep, this probably happened 4-5 times that I can remember, waking up so startled and shocked. When I confronted him the ‘excuse’ was ‘I just wanted to get you in the mood’ and then continued to downgrade and bash me because I wasn’t ‘grateful’ for the ‘pleasure’. It’s not consent if you are asleep. It’s not ever okay. It’s never okay.",,
me and my friends were at the beach and we were followed by a few boys who were older than us. we are minors (14-15) and they looked like they were about 17. one of the boys came up to us and asked us ‘do you want to do anything later with us?’. we’ve never seen them in our lives,,
A boy was fingering me whilst on top of my whilst I had explicitly said I do not want to have sex and due to wetness I didn’t realise he had put his penis inside of me and I looked down and freaked out pushed him off and burst into tears. He probably doesn’t even remember because we were only 15 but he violated my trust and essentially raped me I guess Cos I had said no,,
I am a survivor of sexual assault & rape multiple times. When I was 16 years old every day on my way to school while I was waiting for the school bus a family friend would always be waiting for me at my bus stop and I would be the only one there because no one else rode the bus I was on & he would pull me close to him & he would start kissing me & I would try pushing away but he wouldn’t let go. Then he grabbed my breast & I told him to stop doing that but he thought that I liked him doing that & I told him no. The only thing that stopped him was my bus came so he had to let me go. I told my parents & made a report to the police about what happened but of course he only got off with a warning that if he came around me again then he would be arrested. Second time I met a man in college & I went to his house to hang out & we were watching a movie together & then he pushed me on the floor & held me down with my arms above my head & he was on top of me & he kissing my whole body & I kept saying no but then he got me back & pushed me on the bed & held me down & told me he wanted to rape me & I was terrified. He took my pants off and I kept saying no to him and he put his tongue inside me. He was about to rape me but his phone went off. I quickly put my pants back on & left & called my best friend that I went to school with to pick me up. The last time was a nightmare that I am traumatized from the most. I met this man & his wife who I thought was pretty nice & I decided to move in with them until I got back on my feet. But then as time went on the man became physically abusive & started beating the crap out of me & then he decided he wanted more from me. So he started raping me several times & I would scream really loud but he would cover my mouth & tell me to shut up or he would slap me really hard. He would even force me to give him oral sex even though I would always say no. I tried several times to leave but every time I did or if I tried he would always keep me from leaving. He even decided to have his friends rape me or do what they wanted to me. He even sent me to his own father & brother so that they could rape me & do what they wanted to me. I really did not think that I was going to make it out of that house alive. I mean it was so bad I thought he was going to kill me. I really thought I was going to die there. I went through that with him for 7 long years. The only way I was able to get out was when he left one day I packed whatever I could & I left. I have tried to report him several times for what he did but nobody believes me so he got away with it. I am so scared that another woman or young girl is going to experience what I went through & I don’t want that. This is my story.,,
"It started when I was only 10, and began with boys in my primary school class constantly saying things like ‘you should do some exercise’ or ‘let’s widen the space for her to sit, otherwise she’ll be sat on top of us’, all because perhaps I was going through puberty a little earlier than the other girls. They felt they had the right to talk about me as if my appearance was all I was worth - and according to all their derogatory degradation I was worth very little. They would talk about parts of my body as if they were comedic or something, until these words were not sufficient anymore; they proceeded to talk about other parts of my body sometimes when I could hear, and other times behind my back. They used to joke about dating me, asking me out and then insulting my body in the most sexual of ways. Fast-forward to secondary school, these boys had grown up, their shoulders broadened and their voices deepened; yet their harassment of me persisted. whenever I saw them around in the area they would catcall, and one time one of them proceeded to grope me from the behind. His grip was strong and forceful. They were15, and so was I - all of us underage. yet they felt so much mightier and bigger than I. I was alone, so I stayed silent, I didn’t know what to say: I don’t want to provoke them into doing something further . so instead I remained mute and just put up with it. fast-forward a couple months, I felt battered, worthless and unloveable in every way. I’m so deeply scared to be touched, my whole view of sex and even my perception of self-worth has diminished. I feel like an object of disgust. only recently, they catcalled me again, I should have spoken out, I knew that I had the strength deep down. Yet I couldn’t, something in myself would not let me. Almost as if I felt as if I must deserve it.",,
"I was 10 years old, I had just finished swimming club at my local swimming pool in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I was getting changed in the unisex area of the cubicles with my Dad just waiting outside. I had lost my pull buoy the week before and I needed it for training, so my Dad told me he was going upstairs to reception to go and ask if they had it. I had nearly finished getting changed so he said he would meet me upstairs. I could hear my friend and his mum in the cubicle next door, so I didn't feel scared about being left alone. However, I heard them leave soon after. As I leant down to tie up my laces, an adult male reached underneath the cubicle partition, sliding his fully naked body into my cubicle, and started wanking underneath the partition. He came so far underneath the partition, into my cubicle, I had to jump up on the bench in my cubicle that my clothes were on. I just froze and tried to be as quiet as possible, not breathe, not cry, not make a sound because I thought he maybe he would think I wasn't there and then maybe he would go away. I thought he was going to push his way into my cubicle, underneath the partition, and try to harm me so I was very frightened. This continued for a while and I stayed up on the bench in silence. He finally withdrew back into his cubicle and I grabbed my bag and ran upstairs to Reception. I found my Dad and could barely speak I was so scared. He asked me what was wrong and I felt like I didn't even have the words. The swimming pool called the police and they held me in a room interviewing me. It went to court eventually, but because I was the only witness (and obviously in the court's eyes a 10-year-old little girl) he got off. His lawyer even asked me via video link in the trial, 'Do you think it could have been your Dad who came underneath the cubicle partition'. I don't think any child should be a party to that sort of question after they have been assaulted by a paedophile. Especially when the lawyer knew this was not the case - as my Dad was speaking with staff members at Reception at the time of the incident. Apparently, my mum told me in his statement he said he wanted to go study law in America and this offence would stop him from pursuing his dream if he got charged. To think he is still roaming the streets free makes me FUCKING RAGE - even worse, as a lawyer.",,
When I was 15 I had a boyfriend who was 17; he often forced me to give him oral sex. I told him no multiple times and he would hold my head down to keep me there.,,
"An ex-boyrfriend of mine spiked my drink multiple times. It was his intention to 'loosen me up' as I 'always ended up enjoying myself.' The same ex also sexually assaulted me in my sleep, and I only know this because he brought it up to me and his friends, laughing as if it was a joke. I've only recently realised that this is wrong, this happened more than seven years ago. It terrifies me thinking back to how vulnerable I was with someone I thought I could trust, that actually had no regard for my body or wellbeing.",,
I was dating this boy for a little less than a month and he always touched me I had talked to him but he didn’t listen one day I wore shorts and he tried to put his hand in and touch me there and I had to tell him stop after 4 times of him not listening and my friend who was in the room doing nothing about it I had hit his hand and ran to my bathroom and cried,,
"Looking back on my sexual experiences I have, more times than not, been assaulted with out me even knowing it was wrong because I was so normalised to it. I’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape until later on. I’ve even protected male friends in situations where I should have been more firm with them because I didn’t know what they were doing was wring. I think that fucks me up the most to be honest. I’m tired of it. I had someone I was seeing once who came over to my house after I was crying about the police getting involved with a rape that had happened to me 2 years prior to this. And he just started to have sex with me after I said I wasn’t in the mood, but he protested saying I just had to lie there so I just said whatever, because I was to emotionally drained to protest. So I just lay there on my phone crying. Bare in mind this boy was always the first to beat up a catcaller. I think that mentality boys have of “i fucking hate rapists” and “I will kill them if they touch you” is said just to separate the rapist from themselves. When really the rapists are often not to different from who they are, or at the very least who there friends are. Rape doesn’t just happen in ally ways or on dark streets. Boys need to understand that and maybe that’s when change can happen.",,
"I was sexually assaulted/groped/molested multiple times by the same person that bullied me endlessly, beat me up, harassed my ex friend, he complained when he faced extremely small consequences for bullying me, he threw a rock at my head, it hit me, it was dirty, I suffer from OCD so I panicked, hit me with multiple objects, him and his friends laughed, whenever we would argue and I said to him to stop trying to touch me he carried on, I've never told anyone, he moved away and isn't coming back I hope, but I'm still extremely traumatized. Things will get better.",,
"I was only 13 and was walking, a guy rolled down his window and called me a slag and drove off it made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe",,
On holiday whilst drunk I was followed into the bathroom by a man and was pressured into having sex with him in order to leave the situation,,
"Me and my cousin when we were little were pretty close, however, he probably every day would try to kiss me and when I would try to move away or get away he would forcefully kiss me or get physical to be able to kiss me. When one of my family members once caught him forcefully kissing me, they didn't blame him as he was younger than me, but instead blames me and called me disgusting and the ""devil child"" and how I was dirty for doing what I was doing. back then I didn't think it was a big deal but growing up as now I'm 15 I realized that It caused me trauma by now making any intimate situations with others really difficult and sometimes impossible (like kissing) as they make me feel bad or even ""dirty"".",,
"Truth or dare on school trips - groping, flashing and the like. And this was in year 7. It was about trying to be with the in crowd, and a number of girls who were ‘already in’ were complicit in convincing other girls to participate. Several students have got in trouble with the police about incidents which have taken place out of schools, often at parties where drunk girls (and sometimes boys) were seen as fair game by a small number of boys (who did this sort of thing on the regular).",,
I know of lots of girls at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who get nudes from their current bc who trust them and when they break up they share them around the whole school and just talk about people’s nudes in general and bully people for them as well as just share them around the whole [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] community in general.,,
"I brought a Scottish man back from the club in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We started having sex then he started getting really violent and intensely chocking me. When I asked him to stop he didn’t. Ever since I finally worked up the courage to tell my parents, my dad continuously makes rape jokes and brings up the topic of rape at family friend dinners . This knocks me 10 steps back every time and makes me feel unsafe in my own home. Men of all ages need to learn how to respect their rape jokes and unsympathetic attitudes can trigger panic attacks and prolong the ptsd in survivors.",,
i used to date him but he was shit and i broke up with him and i attempted to be friends with him after cuz we had mutuals. i went to his house once for a party and i was crossfaded. i passed out in the garden with a few of my other mates. he then placed himself behind me and made me lie against his lap. then later on he groped my ass cuz i was wearing a short skirt and then he grabbed my face and gw me while i was passed out. he did this twice. people never took this seriously and never thought much of it but the fact is i never expected this and it really it hurt me and my levels of trust with people.,,
"I was dating a guy a bit younger than me and he went to [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We were seeing each other for a while but I didn't know if I was 100% invested. When Boris announced the lockdown, he was at my house and we both decided for him to stay at mine because it was safer and it gave us an opportunity to see if we were going to work out. I was REALLY poorly, not covid but the worst case of tonsillitis I have ever had. When I was feeling a bit better, the antibiotics had given me a bad case of thrush and the guy was persistent on having sex with me, I didn't say no but i was too weak to stop him and i only had sex with him to get him to stop pestering me. I was very dry and it was really hurting because of the thrush, i told him to stop and he did. I went to the toilet and I was very swollen and bleeding. I went back into the bedroom crying and lay on the floor in pain and he said ''What am I meant to do now? I'm really horny'. He stayed for another night and then I told him to go back home. I never saw him again and I hope I never do.",,
"My ex used to force me into having sex with him even after I said no. He used to guilt trip me by saying i was strange and must have an abnormally low sex drive as he would tell me we had sex ‘a lot less’ than other couples we knew. The times i could bring myself to say no to him, he always suggested i give him head instead, i felt so bad that i often did. There were times he wouldnt let me stop until he came whilst simultaneously preventing himself from doing so by pulling me off him periodically, this would go on for 30mins+. At the time I didnt think much of these things because he was my boyfriend. I thought I was the one making him unhappy. Only months later I realised what a dark place I was in. Even friends pointed out how much happier I am now after he is out of my life. I still struggle to accept that the things he did were wrong because we were in a relationship. Even now writing this I am terrified to post because I doubt that my experiences are valid. I now struggle with intimacy and sometimes have panic attacks when im with my current boyfriend who i love and know would never hurt me. I just wish i could forget how awful he made me feel.",,
"I lost my virginity through being raped at 13.I couldn’t tell anyone at the time as I knew people would have told me that it was my own fault and I deserved it. He told people at school that we had slept together and he sent my private pictures around my year group at school and everyone laughed about it. It massively affected my relationships both with my friends and other boys. My teachers got involved but he didn’t get into trouble for any of it as no one believed it was rape, even though he was 16 and I was only 13 at the time when it happened.",,
"It seems trivial compared to a lot of stuff on here but it still scares me. I’m 17 and I was sexually abused by the boys in my school from 6-11, during primary school. I guess since then any sexual harassment I’ve had has scared me more because it triggers my trauma responses. I may as well get started, so I was walking back to the sixth form centre at my school. It’s a fairly long walk for a school site and I needed to get back there so I could work. I was behind this group of about seven guys from the Lower Sixth, the year below me, and they were walking really slowly. So I thought I should just walk around them and it would be no big deal. But when I got round in front of them, at least half of them started singing part of that song body, it went viral a while a ago but it’s the one with the lyrics ‘have you seen that state of that body, mad, if I beat it I ain’t wearing a Johnny’. Then the others said ‘that’s an ass’ at the same time. I know it was aimed at me because I was the only person in front of them at the time and none of them were on their phones at the time. I’m now terrified of seeing them around school because I don’t want it to happen again. I see them pretty regularly because we use the same buildings and I see them in the lunch hall as well. I’m scared of it turning into a big thing if I say something and I don’t want to confront them about it because of how scared I am. Even if I did report it, I doubt I’d be taken seriously. The teacher that’s in charge of it all is the least likely in the whole school to listen and be empathetic. They like to put on this front that they’re actively doing something about it after the schools list came out, but if we’re scared of the people in charge then it’s not going to do anything.",,
We was all in class and that day my teacher was not there. So we had another teacher. We was all playing around. This one girl did something but i dont remember. All i remember was this boy trying to un-zip my jacket. I had nothing on just a bra. Cs i got milk on my shirt. After that me and my friends went to tell someone what happened. They promised us that she will get back to us but she ever got back me. I thought what happened to me didn't matter or thats what it felt like. To this day i didn't get help no one called me down to the office and talked to me like they said they will. I was in the 7th grade. Im going to be a 9th now.,,
"My immediate thought before writing this was “should I even be contributing? Nothing THAT bad has even happened to me.” And then I realised that’s exactly the attitude that undermines how valid each and every sexual harassment experience truly is. My story mirrors millions of girls out there. From the first time I was groped by a cowardly man in a club to every single time I’ve been cat called walking alone at night and followed when daring to go out on my own for the first time on holiday, it has been accumulating to the stage I am at now. Afraid of every single unknown man I come across on the street. Not because I believe every single man is a predator, but because it’s not worth the unsafe situations of believing they’re not. The biggest effect sexual harassment has had on me is the fear of every single man I meet, it holds back friendships at the start and makes me overly cautious in everyday life and I hate it. I want to be able to feel like I can go for a run at night or walk to see the stats on my own but I can’t.",,
The girls would constantly go round grabbing mine and other boys arses and caressing them when it was made clear by myself and a number of others that it made them uncomfortable. I’ve had a Halloween costume torn open numerous times to reveal my body despite obvious attempts to stop it and have even had my penis grabbed whilst lying down at a party and the girl passed it off by saying she was just “drunk and horny” and by saying “I should’ve enjoyed it”. I was constantly hearing about and even shown by my female friends different guys nudes that they had screenshotted and sent to each other that they kept saved in group chats and such. Guys tend to sexually assault more but by god do girls do it to.,,
I was assaulted and they did nothing,,
"I was in year 5 when a boy pushed me up against some of the play equipment and began groping me. He was m age so he knew well enough it was wrong, I couldn’t get out. But when I did and the school was notified I was pulled aside with the boy by my teacher where I then had to apologise to him for causing a problem. I think he only had one or two days of isolation/detention as “punishment”. I still blame myself to this day.",,
At a party whilst everyone settled down to sleep an ex friend crawled onto the floor next to me (where i was already spooning another friend) and this guy began to to spoon me and started grinding on my ass without ever having asked or checked in with me. I was also good friends with his girlfriend at the time and he had been on the phone to her all night. We were in a room full of our other friends. I managed to get him to stop but he never acknowledged what he did and when i brought it up to mutual friends they said ‘Well you had been flirty’.. I had never kissed a guy at this time and so had no idea what was up and just tried to forget it happened and distance myself from this friends group.,,
"I sat next to a boy who felt entitled to put his hands between my legs whenever i wore a skirt. If i wore trousers, he would then make me feel guilty like i was denying him what he was claiming. This went on for 2 years.He then went on to rape one of my now friends and nobody believed her. Nobody believed me anyway, and I was told to get over it as it was ""just child's play"" That has stayed with me for years and it made me afraid to be alone with a male for ages, and it was only until i was around 16 that i realised it wasn't my fault and he was in the wrong.",,
"I was at a party and got quite drunk. Someone I knew started kissing me and I was kissing him back. The next thing I can remember is being led through some woods near the house of the party were at. The next thing I remember is him slapping me and shaking me shoulder and I wake up and he is on top of me and I am undressed. People start to call out names and he gets me dresses and leads me back through the woods. My shoes were left there. When I get back to the house the next thing I can remember is how much I was bleeding in my pants which had been put on the wrong way. ,Months later I found out that there was a bet between a group of lads as to who could steal someone’s virginity first. This means that it happened to others in our group but no one spoke about it.,No one knows and I don’t feel anyone will believe me. I know this has seriously affected my ability to have sexual relationships as a young adult",,
"I thought I was safe, being in school and all? He repeatedly touched me inappropriately and I made it very clear I didn’t want that and that he was making me uncomfortable. He pretended like it never happened then when he denied it a few days later and the people who saw him do it were saying to him like no you did it. He acted like it was some kind of funny joke we can brush off. I felt like I couldn’t breath and my body felt so dirty no matter how many times I washed; it really wasn’t a joke to me. Nobody even asked if I was okay",,
At uni a guy who I used to study with started touching me sexually whilst we were working. This happened on several occasions. I was too scared to do or say anything. I didn’t tell anyone and I didn’t shut him out of my life because I wanted to pretend nothing happened. I blamed myself for allowing it to happen to me and I felt so ashamed. I started becoming anxious and having panic attacks after that. I have now realised he had been gaslighting me. Making me question whether anything had really happened and making me feel he was the only person I could trust. They also started to victim blame. After this is I felt no one would believe me. Some people now still say to me that he was immature (he was 19) and this is why he did it. They also question why I let it happen on several occasions. I wish that I could have known where to go for support.,,
"One night me and my friends had gone out and we were all really drunk. When we were out we got chatting to these guys who seemed fine at first. As the night went on I got more and more drunk, I was do drunk to the point I couldn't have remembered my name. These guys came back to my friends house and I don't remember much of the night other than waking up in pain and confused. Only to find out a few weeks later that there was a video of me and these guys that was going around the campus but I was so drunk that I couldn't consent or remember my name. Till this day I try so hard to remember that night but nothing comes back to me, I remember leaving the nightclub but I don't remember getting home all I have is that video that was recorded by one of the guys",,
"I was in my pyjamas so not wearing a bra and my brother put his face in-between my boobs. Like fully in them. When I screamed and started hyperventilating my mum and dad told me I was over reacting. I then called my brother a perv and my dad shouted ""how dare you speak to my son like that!"" All I said were words. My brother sexually touched me but there was no ""how dare you treat my daughter like that"". I now constantly feel dirty. I hate the fact that boys get away with this cus ""boys will be boys""",,
Some of the guys made a hot or not insta account where they would vote whether girls in our year were fit or ugly using polls.,,
I went to hang out with two male friends that I had known for years and trusted and we had some drinks together. They tried to get me to engage in a threesome with them and I said no and became upset because one of the guys had kissed me and he was a friends ex so I said I had to leave immediately. The other guy lived near me so said he would get a cab home with me. I was crying with my head in his lap because at this point I was really drunk and really upset and wanted to lay down. He pulled his dick out and put it in my mouth whilst I was crying. I dont really remember what happened next but I never spoke to either of them again.,,
I sent a nude photo to a boy I thought I trusted. He circulated it around the school. The school blamed me and kept me in isolation for a week away from the other students as punishment for sharing the photo - no consequences ever happened for the boy who shared it apart from a light telling off.,,
"I haven't told anyone abt this bc i never realised that maybe what happened wasn't ok. i always felt like i was over dramatising the situation to myself - but seeing everyone else sending in their stories i want to share mine.,I was on things w one of my guy friends for a while, and one night i had friends over and we left to my room and were getting with - which i was very happy to do and fully consented to. he then started to grope me and feel me up, which made me a bit uncomfy but i didn't really mind it so i just let him continue. he then started to grind down and basically pinned me down to rub one out on me. i was in shock and didn't process what was happening at the time so i couldn't even ask him to stop - not that he asked if it was ok or checked how i was doing at any point. i felt so helpless just lying there under him in shock just waiting for it to be over. ,I just felt so used? and disgusted by myself for not asking him to stop? my story is nowhere near as bad as some of the others, but i hope it might help anyone else struggling to accept/realise that sexual assault/harassment can happen in so many ways.",,
i was assaulted when i was 14. Everyone at my school - llandovery college - ignored it and treated it like gossip. It took away the seriousness of the event and it made my emotions feel invalid because it wasn't seen as big deal to anyone else,,
"I walked into a [place omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when I was seventeen years old, heading up to pharmaceuticals to pick up a prescription. While up there, I was told that I had to be eighteen to pick up the drug I was purchasing because of the dosage and strength of the drug, after telling him I wasn’t eighteen already, he continued to creepily flier, ask me how my day was, and even go on to ask where I work. I quickly turned him down and continued out of the grocery store, heading to the parking lot when I noticed he’d followed me all the way to my vehicle. I continued on past my car so that he would be able to see my plates and luckily saw a guy I knew from school who worked there, herding carts towards the building. I started a quick conversation with him and he noticed the situation and talked with me till the man left. I don’t know what would of happened otherwise.",,
"I was just sat down at break and a boy crawled over to my table and went under it trying to touch me up, luckily I didn’t have a skirt on",,
In my business class i was arguing with a boy in my class and i shoved his shoulder lightly. My hair was tucked behind my shoulders but still this boy went to “grab my hair” and touched both of my boobs. The school did nothing except call my mum and his mum.,,
"The general culture at the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] schools surrounding rape and sexual assault is unbelievably toxic. My boyfriend [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] forced me to give him a blowjob when we were first dating, even pushing my head down when I said no. I forgave him and even stayed in a relationship with him because I had a reputation as 'a slut' and everybody convinced me that I must have consented to it.",,
"Boys in my year made an instagram account for one of their sports teams where they would share inappropriate images of girls in the year or write jokes about girls that they had gotten with or slept with (and refuse to remove them if asked, or if one guy would delete it another would repost to spite girls that had ""wronged"" them or their friends). This account is still active despite them having left school, I don't know if they even realise how this made most of the year feel. As if they could never get on the bad side of these guys. Posting a story about everyones invited isn't enough",,
This isn’t rape but sexual harassment he kept of calling me stuff like a pussy and he kept on cat calling me online as well as some of my friends he tried to use me to get to people and he would call me fat and say that he wanted to do things to me he wanted me to send stuff and when I wouldn’t he would call me a slut a whore he would threaten to kill me and he kept on sending texts and he would call me fat and just all of these terrible names and now I can’t look in the mirror the same I can’t do certain lessons I can’t talk about some stuff without bursting into tears,,
"in fifth grade i had moved to a new school and i was able to becomes friends with people quickly, he wrong try or of crowd but oh well it was fun while it lasted. one day during recess my friends and i were joking around and this guy who was kinda in the group but not really had come up talking to us and he was joking around and he was talking to this one girl and he slapped/touched her butt apparently. she was laughing so he thought it was funny and did it about three times to her and eventually he did it to me. i knew it was wrong so i told him to stop but i awkward smiled bc i was uncomfortable. he did it again but we had to go into school then. i told my mom and she told the school, he later got in trouble and had to apologize to me.",,
"It was last summer when a man on the bus sat next to me, I asked him to move at least a couple seats away as he was not obeying the social distancing and indeed my personal space. He kept on brushing his hand on my leg although covered by jeans. I was glad I wasn’t the type to wear skirts and dresses but even so I didn’t feel comfortable.,I eventually got up and he followed me to the seats at the front of the bus. He sat next to me and placed his hand on my thigh. I shivered and got up. I had never felt less safe.",,
Rape jokes are constantly made around school from boys. And most of the jokes are about specific people.,,
There have been multiple occasions where I have been sexually harassed in school and these have even happened in front of peers and teachers. the most recent occasion was the other day where a group of boys (around 13 years old) mentioned that they regularly masturbate to the thought of me.,,
"Someone I thought I was close to, and knew more about me then anyone including the fact that I could be manipulated by certain subjects told me that they were feeling depressed and asked if I wanted to go round to his just for a couple of drinks and a chat. I agreed. When I arrived I'd already had a few drinks, and was slightly tipsy. He was stone cold. I had a couple of drinks in his garden, he had only one. After 30 minutes or so, he led me upstairs. It became clear why I was really there. He only stopped the sex when I passed out because I was that drunk. After the incident I said I didn't want to talk about it, and that it was a mistake. He responded by asking me to be his girlfriend. When I said no he got angry, and threatened to harm himself. I felt stuck in a perpetual state of hating myself, but not wanting to lose my friend."",(1) At age 11 I was home alone when a group of my brother's friends came to see if he was in. They were 4 years older than me and a lot bigger. When I told them my brother wasn't in, they asked if anyone was in. When I said no, one of them stepped closer and said ""so I could rape you then"" while the other laughed. I was so young I didn't even know what it meant, but I knew enough to know it wasn't good. I knew the boys and I don't think for a second it was more than a joke to them, but to me that's indicative of the cultural problem: rape isn't a funny joke, threatening sexual violence to a child isnt a funny joke, threatening a young female who you know to be home alone isn't a joke.,(2) At university I went home with a guy I had been dating after a club night. We were both quite drunk. We slept together. I insisted he use a condom. I was pretty sure he took it off after a few minutes but was too scared to ask. The next morning I asked, he said we had used a condom. I pointed out that I wasn't on the pill so needed to know if not. At that point he said something along the lines of oh I think the condom maybe broke; it was on the floor not broken, he only told me (a version of) what happened when he knew there could be a risk to him as well as me (an unwanted pregnancy). My consent was explicitly based on use of a condom. Only since studying law have I realised that this was rape, rather than just a shitty experience.,(3) aged 26 I was walking through a park in London, looking for some friends I was meeting. A group of men and boys (I think from a family gathering) were walking the other direction. I glanced at them as they passed. One of the children in the group, I would estimate aged 10, started shouting at me, asking what I was looking at. When I didn't respond this CHILD shouted ""I'll fucking rape you"". The adults with them didn't just do nothing, they laughed. How does a young child already know the effect of a threat like that will be (I) female silence or fear, and (ii) in many cases, male acceptance or praise.",,
"When I was 9 an older boy around 13 grabbed my arse. I didn’t know what to do. I remember crying and running out of my lesson trying to explain to the teachers and nurses what happened, I explained I was so uncomfortable didn’t expect it and was completely unwanted. They laughed it off and sat me down with a glass of water for an hour. I only realised years later I had been assaulted, I was 9 I didn’t need to be laughed at, I needed support and to be taken seriously.",,
Someone else also had this horrifying experience at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] so i decided to finally share my story anonymously. During my time at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] i was sexually assaulted by both students and teachers at the school. At the time i was not able to understand what was happening to me and it was only years later when i looked back on my experience that i realised how bad the situation was. The worst part about my experiences is that the teachers that assaulted me are still there and no one believes the accusations that i brought about against them.,,
"I went on a 3 month UK Erasmus programme to France when I was 21. Most of us in the group of 11 from England were from private school backgrounds. We stayed in the same self-catering residential hotel, so sometimes we ate together. One gettogether we had in one of the self-contained rooms started well with nibbles, and drinks. One sober young man threw me down on the bed landing right ontop of me and smothering my face with kisses, groping at the same time. I couldn't get up and was trying to fight him off. His girlfriend was in the room but looked nervous. The rest of the party in the group carried on, seeing but choosing not to, carrying on as if nothing was going on. That stiff upper lip syndrome, pretending not to notice or see anything when there is clearly an elephant in the room has been the ruin of many.... He was pulled off me when I shouted the name of his girlfriend to get him off. I was back on my feet, but the rest of the party just carried on in their small-talk circles. I left the room. This occurred in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. However, there was no information on this educational scheme about who to go to to make complaints. This young man went on to do the same thing on another occasion to another girl in the same group.",,
"when i was in year 8 my childhood best friend who i hadn’t seen in ages came over to visit me. initially there was an uncomfortable sexual twist that he put on a lot of the things he said to me. he described how id changed and objectified my body. he then pinned me down on the floor of my bedroom and gw me. i kept on telling him to stop and he cut my lip and kept on telling me that he was a good kisser and that i should be enjoying it. he was groping me and it hurt a lot. he then tried to take my clothes off and finger me at which point kicked him and locked myself in my bathroom. i had ptsd and struggled bc it happened in my bedroom, i didn’t feel safe anymore. i had lost one of my childhood friends",,
"I was assaulted and harassed by multiple boys daily at [school name omitted at EI to preserve anonymity]. Ig started off by off handed comments and jokes. I laughed because I thought that’s what you were supposed to do. It escalated to them leaving sexual notes in my locker. This caused me so much distress my friend had to take them out everyday so I could open my locker without fear. Things escalated again, they touched my thighs my but and my boobs. Again, I laughed it off and tried to just get through it despite how much pain it caused me. When I came out as a lesbian, it escalated once again. Two boys cornered me and tried to convince me to open my legs because “I would like it if I tried.” They ended up touching me and then leaving after I started crying. Calling me a whore, slut, and a cunt. A girl also attempted to assault me in a school bathroom, but one of my friends helped me out of this situation. I’m not the only girl this has happened to at my school. We all know the boys who do it it’s just not spoken of. They wouldn’t get in trouble anyways. One of the boys mothers who is a substitute at the school was informed of his actions and responded “boys will be boys.” I no longer go to the school but what happened to me there I will carry for the rest of my life and I would never wish it upon my worst enemy.",,
got sexually assaulted aswell as multiple girls and no teachers did anything or did anything to prevent it from happening again,,
"Two things to say,- I know of SO many people who had access to a google drive of all the nudes they’d managed to collect from girls in our year. The guy who started it was only popular for that reason,- went on a school trip in year 9, sailing. Was stuck in a boat alone with a popular boy who kept pressing himself against me and making sexual comments (later he claimed it was “just a joke). There was nowhere for me to go.",,
I was sitting in 3rd year Geography. The boy who sat in front of me thought it would be funny to take his shoe off and start rubbing it up and down my legs. He was egged on by his friends. It was all a big joke to embarrass me. It eventually got to the point where he shoved his foot against my groin and tried to rub there too. When I complained I was told just to ignore the boys.,,
"I have been pressured so many times into sending mixes. As well as had dick pics sent to me without me asking for it. Every girl I know has experienced this at least once. Boys, if I didn’t ask for it then I don’t want it it’s that fucking simple - if I say no I mean no. Don’t ask my why I don’t want to or how you could make me? If I don’t want to send to you then I shouldn’t have to.",,
"They were my friends, or supposed friends who knew about how I’d been assaulted before and swore to protect me. Little did I know I needed protection from them.",,
"I was talking to this boy and we were back at his house having fun as you do, kissing in bed and performing other sexual acts. There was a moment where he asked if I wanted to have sex and I said yes but then very shortly into it changed my mind and asked him to stop which he did. But later when we carried on doing other things he penetrated me again and again I told him to stop. He did this two more times and on the final time he didn’t stop. I started crying underneath him because I couldn’t move and he wasn’t listening to me. He quickly jumped off and didn’t understand what he did wrong. I left his house crying and I realised that so many of these north London privately educated boys have so much entitlement within themselves that they don’t fully understand the concept of consent. It applies in every sexual encounter not just when it’s most convenient.",,
I was walking through the canteen when a guy stuck an umbrella up my... well rear end I was 13 he was 16 I cried and told my head of year [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] he said I was “making a mountain out of a mole hill” and sent me on my way I saw him for 2 years before he left I was so upset when I saw him,,
"I had just joined the school, and had started (really casually) dating someone. Keep in mind we had only been on a couple dates and nothing had happened, since I was inexperienced. But two boys repeatedly harassed me, asking whether we had sex yet and asking what sexual positions I’d tried with him, and describing them in graphic detail. They also did this to the guy I was dating, even after he had repeatedly shown them how uncomfortable it made him. I dismissed it as simple banter at the time but honestly looking back on it now it was really messed up. Even now I am too afraid to date in school again because of the way people treat you.",,
The entirety of year 7/8 I was regularly sexually assaulted by a group of boys. It happened mostly in the lunch queue and they would try and finger me but I didn’t know what that meant and didn’t realise it was wrong. I’d completely suppressed this until now when it finally resurfaced. I was 11.,,
I used to go out with a guy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and he told me that his whole rugby team had gone round and given me and my body parts scores whilst on the coach to a match. I felt so humiliated.,,
i was in PE and was wearing leggings and group of boys were looking at me and saying i have a huge ass and one came up to me and started touching me and the teachers didn’t do anything but watch,,
"I remember being in primary school and being around a few of the 'popular' boys. In either year 5 or year 6, one of their reoccuring jokes was ""rape face"" and imitating an aggressive face. Looking back, I'm not even sure if they knew the severity of what they were joking about. It really goes to show how sexual assault is heavily normalised in boys, from a young age, and how the lack of education stimulates the ""boys will be boys"" mindset.",,
I got raped by someone at school and the school ignored the situation,,
"I was friends with this male for about 10 years, we were very close friends. We both went travelling and went our separate ways for a time. In [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] we met back up and started sharing a van and living/travelling together. We also started sleeping with one another. One night I woke up to him already inside me, he fucked me whilst I was asleep and when I questioned it in the morning he just said ‘sorry I was horny’. Ten years of friendship and my value to him as a human being was nothing - I was just an object that could be taken as and when desired with no consent.",,
"Don’t want this to reflect badly on the school as I thoroughly enjoyed my time there (& think it was just particularly bad in my year) but in general the boys had very little respect for the girls. Maybe because we were ‘invading their territory’? One minor example of this was the normalisation of referring to all girls as ‘yats’ (or sometimes ‘catty yatties’) which imo was very derogatory.,The conversation amongst the boys on a Monday morning would always be a competition of how many ‘yats’ they had got with or slept with - many of these girls being drunk and taken advantage of. What worsened their behaviour was that whenever a girl got with someone it was seen as unacceptable - they would frown upon her, calling her ‘easy’, ‘loose’ and chanting names at her in order to make her feel as uncomfortable as possible. Whilst this would only last a few days, I know that it affected many of us emotionally - causing our self-esteem and self-confidence to fall and for some had more severe consequences e.g. spiralling into mental health disorders requiring medical attention.",,
"I’m currently moving into year 11, and throughout my time in secondary school I have constantly been sexualised and touched inappropriately on multiple of occasions by boys. I have heard lots of things from boys who were making comments about how big my bum and breasts were, weird comments about fucking me, that boys have wanked over my pictures, and even though it may not seem like a big deal to many, it has been something thats always made me very uncomfortable and self conscious. It made me worried to walk in front of any boys in pe with my leggings on, or wearing certain clothes because I was showing “too much” in case one of them said something. I know there are people out there that have had it 10x worse, but I still feel like it’s something that is wrong and just disgusting. Another time which I also think about a lot, is when I was sat in one of my classes with a boy who was a good friend of mine at the time. We were I think year 7 or 8 at the time and i remember him randomly putting his hand on my thigh (quite high up) and asking to touch my bum and just weird stuff. I kind of made it a joke back then because I didn’t really know what to do, but I told him to stop and get his hand off, which he didn’t do at first. Nothing else happened, but after lesson I told my friends about it. I mentioned it on a few occasions to him just to kind of bring it up. I would laugh around and be like “I could get you done for sexual assault because of that one time” and stuff but he’d always laugh it off and be like “i didn’t do anything” “it wasn’t bad” Over the years I kind of just forgot about it and stayed friends with him, till he moved school. I constantly told myself in my head I just made it up or it was just a dream or maybe he just meant it in a joke way, but when a conversation sparked up with some girls in my year, about sexual assault and harassment, this girl told me about the same boy doing the same thing to her. She explained that she informed the school about what happened and they completely ignored it. Although nothing came from it, it made me feel more sane about the whole situation, and that it did happen, that it wasn’t just something I made up in my head.",,
"i was hanging out with these two boys that i kind of knew this last summer, the one i knew left so i was just alone with the boy i wasn’t that familiar with. that day we had gotten high and he decided to get some vodka with his fake id. i was 14 at the time so i had never gotten high and drunk at the same time, it was really hard for me to walk and i was clinging on to the guy who i didn’t really know. he told me to follow him and we were walking over a meadow to a boat yard. he took be behind it and we started kissing, that was fine i didn’t mind it. but then he started to try and take off my clothes and each time i would pull it back up he would pull it back down saying how i shouldn’t do that and how much he loved my body. he started touching me everywhere and this is when i started to really say no, i told him i just wanted a hug that i wanted to go home but he didn’t listen. i couldn’t control myself so he was someone that i was dependent on to keep my balance. he kept touching me and then to try and convince me he kept telling me he loved me. i kept saying no. i don’t really remember the order bc it was last july and my memories were messed up from what we had taken. all i really do know is that he forced his dick inside my mouth and he tried to finger and do everything sexual to me that wasn’t actual sex. the most reassuring thing he said to me was that he wouldn’t put it in because he didn’t have a condom. about halfway through he looked dead in my eyes and told me to stop saying no because it made him feel bad. i don’t remember how i got him to stop but i ran around from the boat yard and he ran after me saying that we should meet up soon. i had to run home crying hysterically without my knickers on. it took me about another hour to get home. i had called my mother and she called the police, i had to say a testimony, give swabs of where he had touched me. that same night at 3 am i had to get more in depth tests done and some weird thing got shoved up my vagina. the next weeks i couldn’t pull down my pants to get dressed, to go to the loo, to do anything. when i had realised the police had made an arrest i got so hysterical because it was my fault for reporting him and it wasn’t fully rape as even if his dick went inside me through only his fruition it never went into my vagina, even if he did try and eat me out. the detective working on my case or the person who was in charge thought that i should drop the charges because he was a rich white teenager and he said that the boy who did this to me had a good family so there was no need to go do further punishment. whenever i go into town i’m so scared i’ll see him and even if i see someone who looks like him i’ll still freak out. it was 7 months ago and i’m still not over it. the amount of times i’ve told a close male friend this story and gotten the questions are you sure you didn’t say yes?? tell me the story so i know you’re not lying. i’m sure you’re misremembering things, how do you know what happened if you were drunk n high???",,
"I used to swim competitively, there was a big group of us all of similar age when we were 13/14 and one of the boys who we were all so close with used to take photos of girls under the changing rooms. We never said anything to anyone else cause we were ashamed and thought we were friends so didn’t want to get anyone in trouble. The same boy (who has now had a girlfriend for the past few years) continually up until this year used to send me nudes on Snapchat randomly that I did not want nor ask for even though I said I didn’t want them (I am now 22).",,
"I was assaulted on a night out. I was being harassed by a man for hours but kept refusing to kiss him. Eventually he grabbed me and kissed me, he shoved me into a corner of the club where he pinned me and fingered me before my friend came and pulled him off me.",,
"When I was around 14/15 I was informed that a boy had masturbated to a photo I posted on instagram. Worse than the fact that he had done it, he had admitted it and it was a talking point around their year and it led to me being shamed by boys/jokes being made about me. I was a child who had been sexualized but completely believed it was my fault and that I deserved to be spoken about in this way. I was expected to laugh it off and some people even thought I would be flattered but it was so hard for me to feel anything but disgusted with myself, especially as some of the people making jokes I considered my friends.",,
"It was around year 10 on New Years Eve and I was on primrose hill. My boyfriend had just broken up with me so I was alone and vulnerable so I got myself incredibly drunk. I then came into contact with a group of boys my age I’d never met before. All I remember is they started passing me round like a toy in a circle of about 5 of them. I would kiss one and then I was pushed onto another to kiss him and I did because I was so so drunk. I then remember one of them asking if they could touch my boobs and I said yes as I was so unaware of what was going on. I woke up with hickeys on my boobs and a intense, draining sense of shame. I stayed ‘friends’ with these boys and chatted to all of them on different occasions as I had no idea what they had done to me or my self esteem. I saw these guys as my friends, and I thought it was great as ‘any male attention is good attention.’ I was treated like some object, Barbie doll they all had a go with. Not as a real persons with real feelings and real trauma.",,
A boy who ive known for a couple of years constantly pressures me to send nudes and cheat on my boyfriend with him. He’ll send me unsolicited photos often. I’m 14,,
My ex-boyfriend at the time who left last year choked and sexually assaulted me at a party and tried to justify it by saying that I wanted it. Afterwards he refused to talk about it or admit that he had done anything wrong and claimed that I didn’t remember the night because I had been drinking. He was in my friendship group so I was isolated from them as a result,,
"I was at a house party with a group of friends and the plan was for a few of us to stay over the night, there was about 5 girls and 3 boys, we all just threw blankets and cushions on the floor to sleep on and as I was falling asleep I started to feel a hand on my leg, I instantly moved the hand away and knew who was laying next to me and told him to stop. He carried on putting his hands on me and putting his hand up my dress and near my underwear, I think I went into panic mode and just froze while he started to touch me. I told him no, and he carried on, I was aware of everyone around us and didn’t want to make a scene and be embarrassed so I just froze and didn’t move until he stopped. I’m sure it only lasted seconds but felt like forever. No one noticed and no one knows to this day.",,
"When I was 14, I joined a community amateur dramatics group. He worked behind the scenes on the show and was 26. He gave me a lot of attention from early on. It started with an instagram follow and an add on facebook before progressing to flirty messages. All of this happened despite him having a girlfriend who was also working on the show. He built up my trust and I thought he liked me. Then, in between rehearsals, I (like the rest of the cast) went to a room to have a nap. I woke up to him touching me. He had his hands down my pants. I panicked and pushed him away from me. I never told anyone because I was too scared - after all, he was the older one and I was just a teen girl who was in the cast. Years later, it turned out other girls had the same experience with him. They outed him. Despite their stories, he was never fired and still works there today. His girlfriend stayed with him - probably out of her own insecurities that he prayed on. The fact that these allegations were never taken seriously still hurts me to this day.",,
The head of year started texting girls in the year inappropriate things and also began touching multiple girls inside school he was taken to court over it,,
A boy a year above me touched me took pictures of me then forced me to send them and share them and continued to do many things to me and humiliate me,,
"In 8th grade multiple male students (me personally a round 7) would go around groping and assaulting the girls at school. I was one of those girls. I personally felt uncomfortable about it but felt nobody cared because staff and students would see and say absolutely nothing. Other girls who were victimized said they ""enjoyed it"" because it meant that the boys liked them. Because nobody seemed to care, I felt it was my role as a girl to sit there and take the abuse. It started with light touching of my butt and boobs, and games like ""fire truck"" and expanded to the point where I was almost fingered without consent in the middle of class - I was able to avoid this by pushing his hands away as there was only a few minutes of class left (before he attempted to put his hands down my pants he was touching my thighs and boobs). I am in shock to this day that these boys did that in front of staff without anyone acknowledging it, and that it took over 4 months for anything to be done - right before summer. This left me traumatized and turned me down a dark road that eventually caused me to be in dangerous situations because I was looking to cope. No 13 year old should be harassed for months in front of adults for months on end.",,
"I dated this boy when I was 15. He would constantly pressure me for nudes and say if I didn’t send them there was no point in us being together and I didn’t really like him. Luckily I never sent any. When we were together, he only wanted to do sexual things. He would grind on top of me while I was just lying there- he obviously enjoying it, but I felt guilty and scared the whole time. Even 4 years later I hadn’t kissed anyone since, and when I have now going to university, I had a bit of a breakdown when a similar thing happened with a guy as I just had flash backs of my 15 year old self and felt really sad tbh. I feel stupid that I could never have a relationship or anything with a boy until 4 years later, Ik it’s not as bad as others experiences. But it did effect me.",,
my nudes have been shared all around [school names omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and now they all ask me for nudes and all their friends started adding me and asking me for more nudes non stop every day and when i ask the boys abt it they laugh and say that the boys wanted me to pop a tit,,
"Girls treated as second-class to boys by institutional culture, teachers and boys alike. To boys, the girls are sexual objects that they are used to encountering at parties (was formerly all boys' school, before girls 'let-in' which itself controversial). Any boy seen speaking to a girl at school is a 'flirt', girls given cruel names. My direct experience being filmed (non-consensual) while in a boarding house by my boyfriend's friends whilst we had sex, who hid camera in my boyfriend's room. Luckily footage wasn't caught, but if it had, I have no doubt it would have been shared round whole school.",,
"One was my uncle by marriage, the other was my neighbor.",,
"Okay so this was Year 11 and I was chatting to this one guy, who, in hindsight, I got a bad vibe from since the start but I put that down to the fact that I had just met him. Amongst the relentless requests for nudes or oral (which in the moment I laughed off), In terms of specific events, after we had messed around one time I made an offhand sexual joke and so he proceeded to try and force me physically to give oral, so I had to push him and state that I gave no consent. Then I forgave him, which I regret. Another time we were on FaceTime and we were having what I thought was a normal conversation but he was masturbating, and in that moment I was so shocked that I blocked out the memory for months. But I stayed. Finally, I went over to his when I was really struggling mentally, and though I went seeking platonic comfort I had conditioned myself to sort of expect him to want oral (bc of the requests earlier), but I didn’t really want it myself. So I stall, I say that we should wait a bit. We move from his room to another, and we start pushing each other around, which I used to think was playful but I remember him trying to push me (softly?) onto my knees, which I laughed off but at that time I believe I was too emotionally exhausted to say no, and due to the physical aspect I didn’t think refusing was an option = not consent (coercion). So I went with it just so the anticipation ended. I’m still trying to decide whether to call it rape, I don’t want to accuse someone of that, and though I’m upset I can’t call him out (no one would believe me) I think my personal healing is more important right now.",,
"When I was 19, I was called 'a bitch' by a guy in his late twenties for not sharing the bed with him... this guy later became my boyfriend because he sent incessant complimentary messages that appealed to my low self esteem which I can now see was entirely calculated on his part, I still blame myself for caving. When I was 20, this manipulative boyfriend had a crush on another girl and called me her name whilst we were having sex then told all of our friends about it, I felt so humiliated and took it out on the other girl, I now recognise it was nothing to do with her but still feel guilty for blaming her. This man was later fired for sexual misconduct which was triggering for me and on speaking to our shared friends, many said they thought it was unfair because he's a good person really and still remain close with him, they are yet to display any empathy for my experiences with him.",,
"I had just turned 16 and went to a party that my friend was having, it was outside and people were going to camp there afterwards. I got really drunk and when the night was winding down I looked around and there was the boy I fancied sat next to me. He asked me to go for a walk, I knew that meant he wanted to kiss me and I went, I remember I couldn’t hold myself to stand up and kept having to lean on him for support. He insisted we went outside the party to the road, we walked along the road until he decided he wanted us to lie on grass next to the road (away from my friends at the party), and started to take off my clothes. I remember saying stop because I was practically naked on a road and felt very uncomfortable, but after he forced oral sex upon me while I was lying down I saw him putting on a condom. I was a virgin and was terrified. Luckily I saw a torch and some friends were looking for me, he wouldn’t let me get dressed and was trying to move forward until I promised we would do it when we got back. The whole walk back was fear. And as soon as we got back he lead me into a tent and the same thing happened only this time I felt it was easier to not fight since I’d promised him before. I was not wet at all and the pain was so intense, the whole time I turned my head and tears were streaming down my face but not once did he stop, slow down or ask if I was alright. I told my friends it was fun and consensual because I couldn’t admit what had just happened, it was my first time, and everyone was friends with him. I couldn’t have sex for a year afterwards. I have finally admitted that it was assault",,
I was in 6th grade when an 8th grader grabbed me and pushed me into the bathroom and started to you know touch me on places I didn’t want to be touched I tried to scream but his hand was over my mouth so I couldn’t,,
I (14) was walking through the school corridor when a friend's younger brother (12) randomly walked up to me and grabbed my breasts (because I had large breasts for my age.) He laughed and I just stood their shocked. I never even told a teacher or a parent. I spoke to his sister and she yelled at him but I don't know if he has learnt or not and it's added to my discomfort of the size of my breasts. Not my first sexual assault/harassment/rape and most likely won't be my last.,,
"Going to a girls school, girls are constantly told to roll down their skirts for the male teachers. WHY?? They should be in jail if they’re looking down there.",,
"I remember in my first term of first year in my flat/gyp of 6 rooms there was one boy who would get really drunk and then try to force himself into one of the girls rooms to get with them. This was so common place that we would all lock our doors when we went to sleep and avoid him once he got past a certain level of drunk. This would happen every night out and one time he sexually assaulted someone. They reported it to the college and the boy was forced to 'intermit', meaning he would have to leave uni and start again the next academic year. They set him up with an amazing internship for the year to make sure he was 'ok'. He now is super successful, in part because he gained a lot of really useful professional experience on his 'year out'. Kind of seems like he ended up better off in the situation than if he hadn't committed the assault??",,
"There was this one teacher who taught chemistry at this school and she used to just pick on me or punish me for things I hadn’t done and was kind/normal with everyone else. I was extremely shy and nervous as I was new at the school and didn’t have much confidence. I was also experiencing bullying not long after this - it seemed that these two boys saw it as easy as it was quite clear to my class that this teacher seemed to not like me. These boys were loud and would try to aggravate people and they would make sexual comments all the time or show pictures of porn on their phone during the chemistry class. These boys used to grab my butt and when I was trying to sit down they would try and quickly lift my skirt. They used to make comments about the category of porn I should be in and would also tell me to shut up if I tried to complain. They used to also mix this alongside picking on me about my hair and making fun of me trying to say that I’m poor and stuff like that. This teacher would allow them to do all of these things. And then months down the line this teacher decided that she wanted to create a seating plan and she put everyone else on a couple of tables and then made one small table only with these boys that were sexually harassing, assaulting and bullying me and with me as the only girl in the middle of them. When I spoke to her about why she had done that as she knows they bully me and she said it’s because she found it entertaining. I still feel a bit upset and let down when I think about the way some teachers at this school were allowed to act there was so much unprofessional behaviour by teachers that this just seemed like it was allowed and that teachers could do what they want because they think it’s fun or funny. Even allowing a child to be bullied and sexually assaulted and watching it for months. And weirdly enough, these boys were never told off or told to stop at all. There were too many incidents especially from the science block of teachers, there needs to be culture change at this school and teachers need to stop perpetuating bullying or sexual abuse and rape culture as at least from my experience at this school the teachers made things worse especially for girls that were shy or timid or lacked confidence in themselves to do anything about it.",,
"While I was there multiple assaults happened, in Y10 we had a history teacher that was obsessed with a certain group of girls- me included. We’d sit in his room at break and I’d often draw. He used to come up behind me, breathing in my ear and asking suggestive comments about my drawings. He had also put his hand on my thigh and would ask me embarrassing questions about my period etc.",,
"A guy in my year watched me getting changed in the toilets over the stall, and often touches me in a very creepy way. Once, he pulled my towel down while I was getting changed and even grabbed my dick.",,
"It was a long time ago now, about 35 years, when I was about 13. I sat next to a boy who used to put his hand up my shirt and undo my bra in this one lesson that we had together every week for a year. The teacher knew he'd done it because he'd tell him to sit with his hands where he could see them after he'd done it, but he never moved him away from me and when I put my hand up and asked to go to the loo so I could do my bra up, the teacher wouldn't let me. I would be so uncomfortable sat there for the whole lesson with my bra undone.",,
"I was 11 years old and had a bad transition to secondary school. I was placed in a school phobia unit where I was meant to get counselling and support. A 15 year old there was picked up by an older man every day. Staff said he was her pimp. I didn’t know what a pimp was. I spent large amounts of time unsupervised in the city centre building. One day a cleaner tried to kiss me, when I did kiss him on the cheek he said it wasn’t a proper kiss, and shut the door. It was 15 minutes before anyone else arrived, and he spent that time trying to make me kiss him properly. I had no idea what danger I was in but knew it was wrong. I told my counsellor the same day. Nothing happened, they didn’t believe me because I was a troubled girl. I never went back and struggled on with my education. I spent years blaming myself for kissing him on the cheek, feeling so much guilt and shame. I have never trusted authority, never felt safe and it has impacted my whole life.",,
"I stopped to chat to my long-term neighbour who was sitting in their garden on a sunny day drinking a bottle of wine. He offered me a glass and we chatted away about mundane neighbourhood things. Noticing the bottle was empty he offered to get another; since it was a nice day and I was enjoying being outside I said ""why not, but let me go upstairs and drop off my shopping bags first"" . Five minutes later he surprised me by appearing at my front door which hadn't been the plan. I was a little wary but convinced myself that he was just being a friendly neighbour so I let him in and we sat chatting in my living room. Everything seemed normal until out of the blue he leapt on me and forced my hands down the front of his trousers. He was so strong and fast that it was impossible to get him off. Despite my protestations he pulled up my jumper and shoved his hands down my trousers and into my pants repeatedly, whilst kissing me all over. It was horrific. I realised that he was about to rape me and TF I managed to stop dissociating long enough to grab my phone and threaten to call the police. He immediately snapped out whatever state he was in and picked up his things. As he left he whispered in my ear ""I've been waiting ten years for this"".",,
"I was sitting in my 9th grade math class, next to a boy who has made countless remarks about my body. Saying I had the best body in the class, after trying to make him stop multiple times I gave up. But one time he put his hands on me, I told him to stop but he kept putting his hands on my chest, making me uncomfortable. I told the teacher and nothing came of it. Soon after more guys made comments about my body and even touched me, but I didn’t bother telling anybody. It’d just be the same.",,
"I still get scared every time I recall this story that the assailant will come hunt me down. Anyway, I was sexually assaulted by a boy over a 3 month period towards the end of Sixth. After the first incident, I said to him, “This needs to stop because otherwise one of us will get hurt.’ I wasn’t ever attracted to him and did not foresee this happening at any point during our friendship, which only existed during my time at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The final incident occurred at his place while I was asleep on his bed. On reflection, 30-40 mins of sleep must’ve passed before I woke up with his hand down my pants attempting to finger me. Once we finally got to talking, he said, “I thought that’s what you wanted.” To be clear, that was never expressed, in fact quite the opposite. Since then, I have been suffering from daily hallucinations of my life being threatened. I experienced conversations with friends who accepted and supported my story though I did have some experiences of “friends” denying my experience and remaining friends with the assailant. You are not alone!",,
"I was in year 10 and this guy was in year 11, and part of a group of asshole boys who constantly tried to get with younger girls. We were texting and hanging out a bit but I wasn't comfortable having sex with him, I had had sex just once before and was understandably very young. I had voiced to him multiple times that I didn't want to sleep with him. I remember once he texted me saying he would stop talking to me unless I slept with him. Being young and impressionable we slept together once. I remember it feeling wrong during and afterwards and I stopped talking to him soon afterwards after he shouted at me over something really small until I cried. He then told everyone what had happened framing me in a degrading light and leading his dickhead friends to make frequent comments towards me. A year later we were in a social situation together and he was trying to humiliate me in front of a boy I liked, and I punched him in the face.",,
I got sexually assaulted by my own boyfriend in school,,
"I was in primary school, very young, and staying over at a family friends home with my mum and brother. I woke up at night and one of the brothers of my friend who was a lot older persistently pressured me into sitting on his lap otherwise I wouldn’t be allowed to play on their Nintendo DS. I was sexually abused. I have arguments in my mind whether or not I imagined it or not but deep down I know that it’s me just trying to suppress everything. I blame myself for being so stupid, but now I blame them. It’s always their fault, never yours. No matter what. No excuses.",,
He made me touch him and he kept trying to touch me in an open classroom during school - the school did nothing about it,,
the second time I had been sexually assaulted in my life was at age 15. I went to a friends house. I had been there plenty of times and trusted her whole family (and I still do). This night was different since her older brother had friends over. I recognized one of his friends from school. He was a senior who was 19. We were talking to them and having a good time when his friend had mentioned he had alcohol. we decided we would have a little bit. we kept drinking with them and eventually her brother left the room. my friend fell asleep on the floor as i sat on the bed with her brothers 2 friends after he went to his room. they continued to get me to drink more by passing around the bottle saying we had to finish it. <p></pI>I was extremely intoxicated and they still continued to pressure me to drink more. It got to the point where I was visibly intoxicated and couldn’t even coherently sing along to the music that was playing. One of the guys started to move closer to me. He moved his hand from under the blanket and began to grab my ass. I looked at him confused and scooted away trying to tell him to stop without his other friend figuring out what was going on. He continued to do it and I kept trying to scoot away but he then put his hand on my thigh and tightened his grip. It scared me so I stopped moving and tried to forget it was happening. He ran his hand up and down my thigh for a while before moving closer to my vagina. He pushed my shorts up my leg and groped me through my underwear. He continued to grope me even after I tried to make it clear I wanted him to stop. This went on for nearly a half hour before he stopped when he saw that my friend woke up. I didn’t know how to process what had happened so I went to sleep. <p></pThe>The next morning when I went home I immediately took a shower to attempt to scrub off the memories from the night before. On monday I had to go back to school and pass him in the hallways. I saw him everyday no matter how hard I tried to avoid him. Every time I passed him I hoped he wouldn’t try and talk to me. I blamed myself for the longest time before I finally accepted that it wasn’t my fault. I was 15 and he was 19 he shouldn’t have touched me in the first place or provided me with alcohol and pressured me to drink it until I was incoherent and throwing up.,,
"This school has been always so low-key but they have some seriously messed up people, including two boys who for years have been begging me, among many other girls from different schools in london for nudes, and for the girls that fell for their tricks and sent them nudes , they would take a picture with another phone and share them with eachother and distribute them on a groupchat and rate how “good” they are.",,
I hit puberty early and by year 4 I had breasts. Between year 4-6 boys would come up to me and try to get a feel of my breasts. I even had teachers and parents asking me to cover up or where a bra or commenting on my breasts size.,,
"I had invited a boy from tinder over so that he could wash my hair, before he arrived I had explicitly stated I didn’t want to have sex. He came over and asked if he could smoke in my room and I’d said no and that’s the only boundary he respected. We were kissing and he began touching me and asked if we could have sex, I said i had already said no. He carried on touching me which I was fine with and then asked me to perform oral sex on him, to which I did. I was still okay at this point. He then was touching me again and asked if we could have sex again, I said no. A few moments later he tried to put his penis in me, and I pushed him away and said I’d said no. I went to lay on my bed so that I was away from him and was in clear distress. I had laid on my front and covered myself with my duvet. He then got on top of me and began touching me again and tried to put his penis in me again, I said no and tried to get up off of the bed and he grabbed me by my hips and pulled me onto his penis and was moving me up and down. By this point I was crying because I thought I would never be able to stop it, he then saw that I was crying and asked if I was okay. I pulled myself away from him and went into my bathroom, where I felt safer. I didn’t disclose it to anyone at the time, and despite his actions I saw him again because I wanted to help him with issues that he was facing, and he r*ped me again and spat on me. I had to buy plan B twice because he also finished inside of me even though I had pleaded with him not to, but he overpowered me on both occasions.",,
"When I was 14/15 I was messaging a boy who was 17/18 from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who was seen as a ""cool"" guy in the area - however he was actually a creep who preyed on younger girls and took advantage of them. He was always rude to me when we were out and said horrible things about me to other people in our group, but was always messaging me and flirting with me on text. When I was out at this party that he knew was happening he started sending me texts telling me to get a taxi to his. Because I was drunk I decided it was a good idea even though I knew he was a horrible guy. When I got to his he was sober as he hadn't done anything that night. He told me how to give a ""good"" blowjob and was really forceful. I told him multiple times that I didn't want to have sex however he forced himself on top of me and started trying to enter me despite me saying no and trying to push him off. Eventually ejaculated half in me without a condom on. Afterwards he made it clear he wanted me to leave straight away and so I did. I had to pay to get the morning after pill the next day. He barely spoke to me again after that until about 5 years later when he lost all his friends because everyone realised he was a creep and now he still continues to pop up and send me weird texts.",,
I was at pre drinks in someone’s halls in first year of uni. I went to a friends room for a rollie. She then locked the door and would not let me leave before she gave me a blowjob despite multiple times telling her no. I feel so torn with what to do because there is such a stigma attached to sexual assault on men.,,
"I was with my boyfriend and we had just woken up, and he was grinding against me which I didnt mind. Then all of the sudden, he starts choking me, and ties me to my bed (cause i already have restraints attached for consensual use) and starts biting me really hard, and Im just so shocked cause this all happens 1 minute after I woke up. I didn’t move or say anything because I was scared and because he restrained me i couldn’t push him off. After, when i confronted him, he said he didnt know I didnt want it, but I didnt give physical or verbal consent and i was visibly frightened.",,
"When I was 9 years old, I was sexually abused for weeks on end by an older boy. It started with him telling me that he wanted to be “a couple”; I was already scared of him at that point so assented out of fear. He was obviously into pornography, although he was only about 13, and had many resulting “ideas” of how women should be treated. The result was that he would force me to do “couple things” like kissing or touching me/ making me touch him whenever he could get me alone during the school day. When I finally found the courage to speak up after a few months, the school made no efforts to separate us and even stated that “it was a matter best left sorted out between the families involved”. I was forced to encounter him everywhere I went for two years until I moved schools. 10 years later, I still wake up screaming at night from recurring nightmares and night terrors. Although I have grown to embrace a healthy sex-life, my story is a stark reminder of the lack of support for sexual abuse survivors - more than just that, we need to stop disseminating violent pornographic imagery everywhere on the Internet, since it ends up affecting young children’s psyche and moulding their impressions of what a sexual relationship should look like.",,
"I walk around my school and hear rape jokes, jokes about “catching a case” (paedophillia and predation), misogynistic and disgusting comments about students in younger years and derogatory comments about girls and women in every class I’m in. All of this is normalised, to the point where a survivor shares their story with a teacher and nothing of worth actually happens for their case against the perpetrator(s). I’m so tired, appalled and downright disgusted and yet I feel so helpless. Shit needs to change.",,
"I only came to terms with the fact that this was SA & rape roughly 7 months after, and since then I’ve been broken inside. I would be drunk at a part and this guy would repeatedly finger me without my consent, I would be in pain but too drunk and confused to stop it. Then one day I was the drunkest I’d been at a motive in control of nothing, his friends coerced me upstairs and I stumbled up into a room with him. I can barely remember any of it, after coming to terms with it I’d get flashbacks remembering pain, the inability to move, not understanding what was going on. Afterwards I blamed myself for not knowing it was wrong, since then any time I get touched sexually I get a flashback and have to push through it, I have to see him around school as if nothings happened and no one cares abt what he did. Everyone knows, yet ppl r still friends with him.",,
At 19 I was raped in my uni halls. He came back to mine but when we realised neither of us had a condom I said that we shouldn’t have sex. He carried on anyway so I just let it happen. I didn’t fully realise what had happened until a few weeks later. He lived in the flat below so we shared the same friends and I never told anyone.,,
"""At my school leavers event it was 3am and the boys and girls were all together waiting for the sun to rise. I was still very drunk. A boy came and sat next to me on the grass and kissed me. I was so taken aback that I didn’t push him off and he then said I should follow him into the woodland area. I was so drunk and definitely not thinking coherently and so I did. I didn’t want to have sex with him but I was too drunk to say no. He continued even when I sobered up from the pain of the sex (I was in no way turned on) and pretended to fall asleep - I didn’t know how else to make it stop as I knew I hadn’t said no beforehand so I thought it was my fault. I had such low self esteem that I didn’t really care it had happened to me nor realised it wasn’t ok. I was made to feel like I couldn’t say no and I had no power over my body. , I only worked out who this boy was several years later (I was so drunk I didn’t even remember his face) and I’ve found out he’s with someone who I considered a friend at school.""",,
"I was 14, and thought relationships were serious. My boyfriend slept with me in my sleep but i thought it was normal because i loved him. He did this multiply times. And now has a rape charge because he did it to someone else.",,
"I was in year 11 and it was a time where there were lots of house parties where everyone got very drunk. I got particularly drunk with a friend and kissed two boys. I had then gone into the garden and whilst in a conversation with a boy, another boy I didn’t know came and stood next to me and put his fingers up my dress and started fingering me. I was really shocked and confused and pushed his hand away and went indoors. Later that night I was leaving and he ran to the door, pushed me on the ground and forced me to give him a goodbye kiss. I felt gross on the way home and suddenly panicked he was going to spread rumours about me so I texted a girl still there to say do not believe anything he said after I left. Two years after this I still had disgusting boys from his school walking over to me filming me and asking me about it.",,
"I was taken up to a nearby forest area by a teacher in his car. I was in the sixth form at a Catholic school. It was a weekend. He was having an affair with a much younger member of staff. I was having a difficult time as the younger teacher had mental health issues and was lodging with my family. He was supposed to be helping me but I ended up on the ground with him lying on top of me and he was getting aroused. He groped me down my dungarees. Fortunately it was too busy an area and he stopped. He was a serial adulterer but I don’t know how many other students he assaulted. The school was run by the usual Catholic hypocrites. When another teacher had a relationship with a married teacher, they kept him and promoted him, but forced the female teacher to go and work in a really tough school elsewhere. She had a nervous breakdown. It was one rule for the men and another for the women.",,
"This is something I’ve never spoken about because it was family. But seeing the brave people write about incidences involving family I feel I should too. My mum was going out with a guy and as is it was getting serious we all went on a ski-trip so his kids could get to know my brother and I. I was sharing a room with my brother and one of his sons who was also my brothers age. I was around 7 at the time which would make the boy around 11. Our beds were all tightly together as it was a small room. The boy was in the middle of me and my brother so I don’t think my brother was aware of what was going on. When it was time to sleep the boy would keep asking me to show him my arse. And when I said no he would take my toys or something and say ‘u have to show me/let me touch it or u won’t get it back’. I remember him pulling my pyjamas down to look at me and touch me. My mum ended up marrying his dad for a few years making the boy my step brother. I never had another incident like that with him. I think he was just sexually curious and didn’t know what was/wasn’t okay, and I, being so young didn’t really know either, but a part of me must have known something wasn’t right for me to remember it all these years later. I just think it shows how consent needs to be taught from a very young age to avoid stuff like this happening. The second children can speak they should be told “it’s not okay if someone does this/it’s not okay to do this”.",,
"When I was around 14/15, my guy friends started playing a game where they would put their hands on my bum and compete over who could hold it there for the longest without me noticing. I don’t really know where the game came from or who started it but they used to it all the time, especially at parties when I was drunk. Everyone would just laugh. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed but I used to laugh along with them.",,
in the lunch queues at my school there would constantly be this huge heard of people pushing back and forth to get into the lunch hall. and unfortunately many boys found this to be a great opportunity to grope the years below them. we couldn't see exactly who it was as everyone was constantly pushing up against one another but the fact that they thought it was okay is disgusting.,,
"I’ve experienced boyfriends in the past forcing their hands down my trousers with the comment it’s okay because we were in a relationship. I grew to understand that it was not okay and resisted more. I’ve had random guys attack me in broad daylight on main busy roads after school and my classmates just walked by, I quickly became known as a slut in school and the bullying I had faced for years got worse when my friends turned on me hearing about what I had supposedly been up to. More recently I was in a relationship that was controlling. Friends had tried to warn me, but I didn’t see how he was controlling me at first. Over time I became more aware of it and tried to talk it out, but he started to threaten me, lock me in his car, and forced me to sleep with him. I got out of that relationship as soon as I could but he continued to attack me by harassing me, stalking me, and threatening me and people close to me. He tried turning me against all my friends and family whilst I was in the relationship with him and when that didn’t work and we broke up he tried to turn everyone against me.",,
There was an older pupil that pressed up against me in the lunch queue one day. I felt his groin on my bum and then I felt him squeeze it. I told one of my friends but they just told me that I was lucky someone so hot touched me. I genuinely have no idea if I’m overreacting but I genuinely felt so disgusting after and now I don’t know if I was actually meant to think that he was somehow complimenting me. I always get slightly worried now when I have to stand next to older students because I’m worried it might happen again.,,
"Since year 7 I have been groped and my body has been touched by boys my age and it's still happening in year 9 now. I'm so sick of this. The teachers brush it off and say ""but theyre boys it natural"". I hate it here.",,
"I was on a night out with a friend in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and my friend started getting with this guy. It was just the two of us so I just danced awkwardly by myself in the corner. I was really drunk and this guy came up to me and started talking to me. He then grabbed me and started to kiss me and I tried to pull away but he was so much bigger and stronger than me and I couldn’t move. He then put his hands down my trousers and fingered me then got my hand and put it down his trousers even though I said no and was visibly terrified. I have never felt more afraid and helpless. Once he was done, he walked off and left the club.",,
"In [date censored by EI to preserve anonymity], i was sexually assaulted on the school bus. At first we were having a normal conversation amongst friends then once they all got off that’s where it started going downhill. At first he put his hand on my thigh and squeezed, he then moved his hand further up until he reached my private area. He began rubbing my private area , for at least 2 minutes. I had no idea what to do and I went stiff, laughed it off awkwardly after he stopped. However, I felt extremely ill and uncomfortable. I never came forward about what happened because I didn't want to do much of it. It’s been just over a year since it happened and i’ve now gained the courage to speak up about it.",,
an older boy i’d been talking to convinced me to meet him and get a hotel room so we could have sex. he was very forceful and despite it being my first time he was reluctant to stop or slow down. it wasn't rape but there were times i wished he’d stop or just check i was okay. once he’d finished he got dressed and left and never spoke to me again. it became pretty obvious he just wanted to take my virginity and didn’t care about me once he had.,,
I met this guy at party of a friend and we hit off and added each other on snap and kept on talking on snap for a few days. Then he kept on asking me for nudes and I said no as I didn't feel comfortable or want to. He made me feel bad and told me I was listening to what he wanted and was being selfish and a frigid. When Itired to call him out on it he told me I wasn't trying to understand and was trying to cause an arguement. He made me feel like I was going mad so I blocked him,,
guys would often slap my ass while i was walking and i told the principal and my mom but they didn’t do anything ab it n just invalidated the situation,,
"Well, it isn't as severe but the are rape jokes going around in this school. A boy telling my friend that he raped 2 people an myself. But another boy just generally joking how he would rape my friend multiple times just for the fun of it. But we didn't tell any teacher, we couldn't how would we explain it. My friend had a very bad panic attack from this experience and the teacher didn't even bother to ask why they were like this?",,
One of my male friends has always made sexual comments about my bum and sometimes I laugh it off but often it’s really uncomfortable for me. One time late at night he was really drunk and texted me and told me he took a photo of me from behind at school and went to the bathroom and masturbated over me.,,
When I was 14 I was groomed online by a man who was 27 who told me that he wanted to rape me and he would continually get off on it. When I told my friends they just thought it was funny and nice that I had an older man that was attracted to me.,,
"I was inappropiatly toutched, and my lower half clothing was pulled down. The school did nothing about it.",,
She got me drunk and despite me saying no she put increasing pressure on me until I didn’t know what to do. I felt disgusted and it haunts me to this day that as a male I was raped.,,
When I was in school I struggled to fit in their I was sexually assaulted and blackmailed. My first time was in year 8/9 and I was walking to my learning support centre in my school and the lad was in my way I asked him to move politely he didn’t so I walked past him he grabbed me from behind and grab my boobs and another lad was their and he thought it was funny but I got away cos I defend myself I told my school and their were cameras but they said they didn’t work for the a long time I got punished because I defended myself and got put into detention and he just got a slap on the wrist like nothing happened. Then a few years later it was year 10 when I was talking to a lad over a social media app called Snapchat and we started playing a game over Snapchat called truth or dare but after a while it turned rlly sexual I was peer pressured into sending nudes and then he blackmailed by saying if u don’t send me them then I will send them around the whole year group. His ex-girlfriend only believed me for a bit until he twisted everything. I couldn’t go into my lessons for months to nearly a year because everyone was defending him. I reported it to my school but they did nothing expect blame it on me and it was all my fault I couldn’t go into my lessons I was so afraid and scared people were talking about me behind my back and only a few girls believed me. It was hard the school did nothing expect say it was all me. Even now I am still afraid to see him in the streets cos he could still have the photos.,,
"I have had a lifetime of cat calling, groping and men exposing themselves. When I was 18 I worked in a hotel and a manger came in my room at night and wanked himself off on my bed - dunno how he thought this was ever acceptable. Sorry but stuff like this put me off relationships for life - I just can't see it as anything else but predatory. I know people will disagree with me but I just can't trust anyone. I am 52, I have never had a relationship. I had a holiday romance once but it only lasted until he dumped me cos I wouldn't sleep with him. I now have poor health, am overweight and older. Thankfully it keeps people away but I still get called names by men on a weekly basis because of how I look. I just want to be left alone.",,
"When l was 16, a guy who was almost 18 at the time repeatedly asked me for nudes. I refused many times and gave him valid reasons. The guy started airing my messages but l was already too attached to just let it go. So I texted him and apologised for not sending him what he wanted....He manipulated me into sending him my pictures , the only thing he wanted me for. The only reason he ever spoke to me. The very same guy got what he wanted from me and now he isn’t talking to me anymore",,
"I was sexually harassed for 2 years straight by most of the boys in my tutor class, they’d make comments about my looks and asking me to date them fully knowing that I am lesbian, at one point one of them decided to spread a rumour that I had sex with him. I was also groped in class after asking multiple times not to be touched, I felt dirty for months after realising what had happened, I was 13 when this started.",,
Through my whole secondary school experience many boys have repeatedly touched me and other girls under the table without consent. When we tell them to stop they take it as a joke and carry on until they want to. It has scarred me for a very long time and I know other girls must feel the same.,,
"When I was at school I was forced to give oral sex to a boy who I had considered a friend. We had done stuff before but that shouldn’t have given him the right to force me. I went to the school about it, they gave me the option to “ go ahead with the allegation and “ ruin his chance at finishing his a-levels” or just go to the school counsellor to talk about it and leave it at that. I was guilt tripped into pushing it aside and having to see this boy every single day.",,
I was 15 and went out with a group of friends in summer. We were all drinking and i got with a boy i liked at a bar. Another boy was hitting on me despite seeing me with the boy i was with I said i was interested. We all went back to a friends house and drank more. The boy who had hit on me earlier ended up taking me to a bedroom and according to witnesses we had sex. I had never had sex before but can remember being in pain. When we left the bedroom i was slut shamed and shouted at and the boy was told ‘yes lad’. I felt guilty and used for months. The worst thing was the boy being praised and me being slut shamed even though i was too drunk to consent.,,
"When i went to a house party at someone i knews house, a group of boys showed up to sell weed to some of the people, and decided to stay. after a few hours i got with one of them, we were in a bathroom doing stuff, and he started doing things that made me uncomfortable like grabbing my breasts too hard, and pushing my head down when giving head and always making me sick, i got up and left the room. Later that night i was in a bed with him akd 2 other people, i was so drunk and i just wanted to sleep, he asked me if i wanted to do 'stuff' again and i said no, i want to sleep. some time later i woke up to his fingers in my vagina. it was painful, i was tight because it was non consensual, he made me bleed and it hurt to pee for a week. he grabbed my hand and put it on his dick, but i was so gone i couldnt move l, my hand just slipped off and i was frozen in a state of shock. he eventually got up to pee and then another person got in the bed and he couldnt get back in. i couldnt sleep after this point and stayed up. It took me months to fully accept that what happened wasnt my fault. i blamed myself because i was drunk and because i had done stuff with him earlier, but i was asleep and i said no. and he was very disgusting. the worst part is i never saw him as my abuser for so long because i felt as though i was at fault. i went to a party another day where he also showed up. i avoided him all night but didnt wanna go home as it was very late and my dad was sleeping, it was a far walk home too. After avoiding him on this occasion i received messages from him the next day telling me that i 'wanted it big' the night before, to which i replied, 'you tried and i rejected you, i definitely didnt want it'. He made me feel like it was my own fault but this made me realise that he was a disgusting predator. Another girl told me she received the same message after rejecting him which proves he doesnt understand consent or the word no. i hope he hasnt hurt anymore girls the way he hurt me. its been 2.5 years and it still affects me largely. i went through counselling 6 months after the incident and it was the first time i told my story. my counsellor asked if id gone to the police and i said no because i didnt want to acknowledge it, and she suggested to me that i shouldnt go because the lack of evidence would get the case dismissed and it would just cause me more mental stress. it took my a while to be intimate again afterward and i dont feel comfortable with the standard way of fingering because it makes my body cringe and evokes a lot of stress and anxiety and brings up all the trauma all over again.",,
"I remember joining the school and feeling like this was going to be an amazing change for me. I was so so wrong. Over the two years I attended the school I remember being slut shamed by the boys and harassed for sexual favours, I know I wasn’t the only female student that this happened to because it was so regular and it was “normal”. If we went to a member of staff we where told “ don’t be silly” or “don’t worry about it”. However I did have to worry and so do the other female students. There was only a handful of us in a year (the school is mostly boy populated). Girls where often forced into toilet cubicles by the boys and forced to do something sexual to be let out. I hoped I’d never be one of those girls but I wasn’t that lucky. I got forced to give hand jobs and blow jobs while letting the boys feel me, it’s a mental and physical pain I wouldn’t wish on anybody. I was constantly in fear whenever I went to the toilets due to it being unisex so boys would be there and I wouldn’t know if I was going to be forced. I dreaded going in everyday because teachers wouldn’t do anything and some male teacher would make comments on our body’s so we get unsafe around our teachers as well as male students.",,
"i was 13 a freshman and a couple months into the new school year i started dating this sophomore he was the sweetest guy, i ask him if he wanted to go to our schools football game with me and he said yes. when we got there we meet up with a couple friends and i was smoking with them he usually smokes with us but he wasnt in the mood to. during halftime me and him are behind the school flirting with eachother and making out, he tried to go down my pants and i told him to stop and he didn’t and i was super uncomfortable and didn’t know what to do i panicked and started to move and he grabbed my wrist and just squeezed it so hard, i just let it happen because he was bigger than me and there was no way i was gonna leave.. a few mins go by and he finally gets off of me & leaves. a couple days go by and he tells me what he did because he thought i didn’t remember but he said it was my fault that i was high and he would have never done that if i wasn’t. it honestly broke me",,
"I was 15. My boyfriend at the time (several school years older) coerced me into sending multiple nudes even though I explicitly told him I was uncomfortable with it. When I told him I wouldn’t do it, he threatened to hurt himself- sometimes if I refused or expressed my discomfort to him, he would go as far as explaining in detail how he was going to harm himself until I gave in. He kept all of the pictures after we broke up- I know for a fact he sent them around to friends.",,
"In my first year in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], my neighbour, an upper sixth boy who I liked and trusted, pushed my head down onto a bed and dry humped me forcefully while two of his friends watched and laughed. It must have only lasted half a minute or so but I couldn’t breathe throughout. Once he relaxed his grip, I burst into tears and ran downstairs to my friends, only to have one of the laughing upper sixth students, a girl who I similarly trusted, tell me that he was joking and that I shouldn’t tell anyone. I never did, but had nightmares about it regularly until I finally opened up about it last year, 10 years on.",,
"Stared at, cat-called, gaslighted, groped, harassed, slut-shamed, raped, as long as I can remember this has been my whole life. I feel like I don’t own my body. Every day I have lived in fear of walking past builders, having to sit next to a boy in school, covering my drinks whenever I’m out. Why do men get high fived for having sex and we get called sluts for consensually having sex with as many people as we want? Why is that a bad thing? It’s a choice, why is it an offensive word? I feel like men have so much power in that word, what if we started taking this as a compliment? If a woman has chosen to fuck as many people as she wants consensually then she’s a fucking legend too. If a woman chooses not too then so is she. Why are boys growing up so entitled and unafraid of consequences? Thinking women are here to please them, are we just sexdolls? Someone asked once what would you do if for a whole night every single male disappeared on earth? Everyone answered things like ‘dance and sing through the streets’. We are still second class citizens, we are not free",,
I was at a party and my friend was drunk and barely conscious when a close friend of hers took advantage and assaulted her. She could barely string a sentence together let alone consent. Boys need to be taught from a early age what consent is. Nobody believed her and we lost a lot of friends because of this.,,
I was walking up the stairs and some boys lifted up my skirt and catcalled me,,
"I met a guy who was friends with my older brother, he invited me out to explore. We did and he asked me to kiss him so I did but I verbally expressed I wasn’t interested in going any further than that. He then forced me to my knees and forced me to give him oral sex with a strong grip on my hair (which was in a ponytail) and the back of my neck; enough to where I could barely breathe and with the few breaths I could manage I’d say “stop” and “no”. Then proceeded to tell me if I informed anybody they’d all say it was my fault because “I agreed to meet him and to kiss him” although I verbally withheld consent for any other sexual activity. He then told me “you asked for this” and “you disgust me” before going back to his house, as I stayed where I was cleaning myself up, wiping me tears, and pulling my hair out of the ponytail to cover the bruising on the back of my neck.",,
My “Stepbrother” raped me for 3 years and my dad knew but he did not do anything about it.,,
"When i started school, it was all going well, all up until year 8. i was getting called a slut or a slag all the time. A few weeks before, there was this guy i really liked. we used to hang out all the time and, one day, he got a little too comfortable with me. Ge would always stroke my leg while i was sitting next to him, or he would touch me in places i didn't like when he hugged me. I eventually told him to stop, but he just laughed it off and kept doing it. Oeople saw and that's how the name calling started. because of that one boy, all the other boys in the school thought it was okay too. They would all cat-call me when i was walking outside of school and on my way home. It made me so uncomfortable, and sometimes, a group of boys would follow me home.",,
I was in my third year this is my first time coming out about it as the school have done absolutely nothing about others experiences with teachers and students in this school but i was in math class and the teacher would just non stop stare at every girl in the class in the wrong places and no matter how many girls asked him to stop he wouldnt a lot of us have mentioned it to the school and nothing was done about any of them only one who had pictures of little girls on his school computer. a science teacher also would drop things on purpose and would bend down and look under girls skirts or look at their bottom halfs and they would let students off with rape/SA one boy had raped a little boy and they protected him and his innocence even though so many girls went to the school about him staring sexually at them,,
"I went out clubbing with my best friend, I trusted him with my life. He spiked my drink and raped me at his house, I didn’t recall what had happened until a few days after.",,
"When I was in ninth grade I signed up to be a water girl for my schools football team to help me with my fear of guys, but it just made me even more afraid of them. I found out a few weeks after it happened that every time I would bend over to pick something up or to fill the water bottles up some of the boys would go behind me and would air hump me to make their friends laugh. When I found out I told the couches and the boys didn’t really get punished all they did was kick them off if the team. I feel like they should of been suspended.",,
"since theres not a lot of same sex problems here, might as well include one. there was this guy in my year who used to be really close to me. i didn't kiss him during some truth or dare game our group had. since then, his mocked me daily for being gay and will do sexual stuff around me and tell me that he knows i like him. truth is i couldn’t care at this point its just tormenting. but he keeps doing certain sexual stuff when no ones around and bullying me when everyone’s around. its just sad. not really r*pe but definitely some level of se*ual harsssment",,
"He had been my best guy friend for a year and I went over to his house to make music. We went into the basement to have lunch and he started touching me and trying to kiss me. I was in year 11 at the time and had a boyfriend that he knew. He had locked the basement door without me knowing, I kept saying “stop, no, I need to go” and he carried on like it was a game. This went on for a while until I was able to call my boyfriend so he stopped because he was scared. I ran out and called my best friend and cried. A year later, I find out he is dating someone I know of so I tell a mutual friend what happened so she can inform the girlfriend of what he had done in the past. This mutual friend ended up telling lots of people and everyone knew. 3 years have passed and still I get very uncomfortable around men, find it difficult to make platonic or romantic relationships with them and get PTSD episodes. I told one of the godolphin counsellors about it and she doubted me and asked “maybe he thought you liked him, you went over to his house after all”. That is when I lost all hope in the school system that I was going to get any support.",,
"My flatmate met this guy online and invited him out with us on a night out. I was left alone with him for about 2 minutes, in which he restricted my arms and started kissing my neck against my will. I left the uni because I kept seeing him everywhere and it made me have panic attacks and flashbacks.",,
"I went home with him after a night out whilst on mdma, i repeatedly said no and that i didn’t want to have sex, however he still chose to do so and it continues to affect my life daily.",,
A group of boys joked about drugging me to rape me and nobody sees an issue with it,,
I was around 12-13 years old when my mums boyfriends sisters son started doing odd things. I was you g so I didn’t think much about it but we would be playing computer with my younger brother went it started as a fighting match for fun. It started call down until he started slapping my bum and squeezing it. My mum knew he was odd but didn’t realise he would do that to a little girl. I know it’s not sex or anything but it’s still important! It took me just about 3-4 years to realise what had been happening…,,
I was pressured into giving oral after repeatedly saying no and another time I was guilt tripped into having sex (these were two different people and happened more than once),,
"This was a few years back now when I was at a sixth form open day at a all boys school with a mixed sixth form. We were in the auditorium/hall for a talk after the tour and as well as the regular seats facing the front the school had set up more seats on the stage for more stage. As the seats had filled up the rest of the people there (mostly girls) were walking across the stage to the extra seats, and as they were doing so the boys sitting behind me were rating them and saying stuff like peng and I would for every girl who walked past. They weren’t the boys who went to the open day school so I don’t know what school they actually came from but it was horrible and I felt too scared to say anything. These girls were just walking and they felt entitled to rate how they looked as if they were objects on display?",,
"I was in a relationship for a year between the ages of 13 and 14. My boyfriend would pressure me into doing things I didn’t want to do and then told everyone that I was a whore and easy. When I eventually broke up with him he wrote his English speaking exam on how I made him suicidal and the teacher gave his a distinction and no one ever apologised to me I was so traumatised."",I spent a year trying to get the school to address the rape culture that exists at the school. Yet, because I did so behind closed doors they ignored and dismissed my complaints. It seems that schools are only willing to take action when their reputation is on the line, which shows how little they value and respect their female students.",,
"I still feel an enormous amount of guilt for this and im not sure how much is my fault however,, I started talking to this boy in my year, pretty popular, a good reputation etc. First of he started by explaining that us talking is just a bit of fun, and that its just between me and him, so I went along with it, it started off as really sweet things and compliments, but it quickly turned sexual, he'd talk about how he'd wanted my nudes and how he sneakily stares at me and objectifies me in class frequently. After this he made the call to stop the talking as it ""got too weird"" for him, and blamed it on me. we then started texting again, and this time it was pretty similar. I started to pick up on the fact that he would only talk to me over text, and not publicly in school, which bothered me. anyway, we went back to texting and this time it just got worse, he made multiple comments about my body in my pe kit and even told me I should do more pe so he could see me run as he likes the way I look when my tits bounce. he'd also text me about how he saw my ass that day and that it looked nice. one day I'd had enough and I decided to confront him. while I was arguing with him, he texted one of my friends and said that he didn't understand why I was so mad and hurt and that he said sorry so everything ""should be okay now"". he also told my friend that it was my fault it got sexual and that he didn't do anything wrong. he gaslighted me into deleting all of our messages, I guess so I had no proof. and then when I started to tell people what had happened, he told all his friends that I had offered him nudes, which obviously, was a lie. when I told his friend, he just played it off as a joke and said ""he just doesn't know how to talk to girls"" . the worst part was the fact that I liked the boy at the time, so I was willing to talk to him still, even though I felt uncomfortable.",,
"I know this is NOTHING compared to what these other girls have experienced, and I’m so proud of everyone for sharing them, but I had two experiences with a boy and I made me very uncomfortable and made me feel so violated. There was a guy, x, who had a crush on me and asked me out. I said I didn’t like him back and I wanted to just stay friends. I thought he took it quite well, and we stayed friends, but then he started making sexual comments about me behind my back to his mates and told them that I had sent him nudes and everything. I told him to stop multiple times. Then he started to send me unsolicited dick pics, at which point I confronted him about it. He just laughed and called me a slut. Our mutual friends believed HIM over me and we kind of split up after that. I unfriended him on all his social media and cut off contact from him. Again, I know this is SO little compared to what some women have experienced, but it was still a violation of my consent and I am now always weary of making friends who are guys",,
"in year 7-9 boys and girls would swim and do waterpolo together. whenever we played waterpolo the coach split us into a boys team and a girls to compete against each other. i remember going underwater to try and get the ball and a couple guys would grab at my ass or tits, initially i thought that it could have been accidental as waterpolo is a fast and rather aggressive sport. however, this repeated itself several times and i found out that other girls in my class were experiencing this too. The guys would also rate the girls walking out of the changing rooms and gossip about our bodies. i remember how excited i used to be to get into the pool when i was younger, i would be there 5 or more times a week doing swimming lessons etc., but honestly even now in year 11 i feel really uncomfortable going into the water unless it’s an only girls group.",,
I was at a house party with friends from my school. It was mostly guys and I was there with 3 of my girlfriends. We all drank a lot and I was hanging out in the garden with one of the guys. He pulled me towards him and aggressively tried to put his whole body weight on me. I was trying to push him off and said stop but he wouldn't and no one came to help as they thought I was just joking and 'wanted' this. He then said we should go on a walk and took my my hand pulling me with him. I was very drunk but tried to fight back in vain. He again thrusted his body on mine and put his hands down my pants. It hurt. I told him to stop and finally managed to get him off me. The next morning I cried and cried and got responses like oh but he was just drunk he didn't mean to. He did what he did and it took me a while to realise it was rape.,,
"Having my knickers ripped off by 2 boys on a school trip bus, leaving me with just my tracksuit bottoms which these boys then constantly tried to pull down to expose me as we did an assault course. Having not been able to completely humiliate me in front of my fellow pupils they waited until I was back at my predominantly boy's school and as I was leaving the dining room grabbed me and pulled down my tracksuit bottoms in front of everyone. They exposed me not just to a range of boys but also dinner ladies and teachers, while they stood on laughing at my complete humiliation.",,
"At 13 a 17 year old boy spiked my drink and raped me in a tent, I was fading in and out of consciousness the whole time, I’m now 19 and this is the first time I’ve shared this with anyone other than my closest friend",,
Rape culture was so normalised in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] that boys my age found it funny to grope you and up skirt you around the corridors and the jokes were horrible,,
"I have been raped twice and sexually assaulted many times. My sister’s husband admitted to me that some years earlier he had sneaked into bed and raped me while I was asleep. I was staying at my in-laws and the rest of the family were downstairs at the time. The other time was when I had a second date with a guy when I was about 18. When I got to the place he was staying on holiday his brother and a couple of his friends were there. His brother raped me while the others watched and verbally abused me. The guy I was in a date with tried to protect me and eventually got me out of the house. Numerous incidents like bum pinched in train, man pressing himself against me in a boat, another in a tram. Only two years ago when I was 66years old I had a man put his arm round my waist and and squeeze me uninvited and a few minutes later another man tried to kiss me on the lips. When will it it end?",,
"Happened when I was 15 at a friends party, an older ""friend"" dragged me into a neighbouring field, raped me, and then went back to the party and told everyone we had sex. I was covered in bruises, told friends who didnt really care or believe me, other's called me a slag for it, told my mum who told the school but I still felt really alone and unsupported, felt like everyone brushed it off like it was nothing and that I should just get on with it, so tried to commit suicide multiple times. The school therapist told me to ""tap yourself on the forehead everytime you think about it to try and forget""... 11 years on and I've not recovered at all, but nowadays I have a far stronger support bubble around me so cope far better than I did back then.",,
"my boyfriend at the time and me were laying in bed and he began to try to finger me for the first time after he’d asked me out around 15 minutes before hand. i kept saying no and i was uncomfortable but he kept trying and he was hurting me. after around 6 times i gave up and let him, i didn’t enjoy it at all, it really hurt me as it was my first time and afterwards i went to the bathroom and i was bleeding.",,
Some boys went into the girls changing rooms and writing their names on the walls and the school only said not to do it again while girls get shouted at because they didn’t get changed for sports immediately when we had actually been told by another teacher to wait. Also many boys keep opening the girls changing room door and blatantly staring in when people are getting changed and the school has done nothing.,,
A guy I was speaking to showed my nudes to his friends when we were 17. I found out because one of his friends showed me their group chat where they’d laughed at me saying my “pussy looked like a kebab dropped on the floor” (which is also racist by the way),,
I was groped literally in my history class. Nothing was ever done,,
"my sixth form film teacher used to always stare at me and a few other girls when we walked by and his eyes used to linger on my butt and breasts whenever he was talking to me and he always just made me feel uneasy. on our last day of sixth form he got my class a different film each and mine was “the perfect storm” and it had a note in it with his personal email address and it just didn’t feel okay. he made a few passing comments about me “getting all the boys” and “having them forming a line when i go to uni” when my class was getting photos taken and was just too close and his eyes wandered and it was two years ago but i still think about it. he teaches minors, he can’t treat us that way.",,
"When I was 16 I gave my friend my drink when I went to the bathroom at a house party. When I came back and drank it it had been spiked, by him, someone I trusted and considered close to me. I realised and stopped drinking but late that night I passed out. I don’t really remember what happened next but I know I lost my virginity because my friends told me about it the next day. They said they didn’t stop it because they said we were both equally drunk so it wasn’t dodgy or anything. If I’m being honest i haven’t felt comfortable around them since. I tried hinting at my school some of what happened (an a rlly indirect way) and they said that everyone was responsible for their own safety and ppl shouldn’t put themselves in such vulnerable positions, especially when they know the risks.",,
"""It was the summer after GCSEs and my friend and I had been invited to a gath by her boyfriend. We were the only two girls there and at the gath, there was around 8 other boys. We spent a few hours playing drinking games and I remember feeling very drunk and dizzy, and this was definitely the drunkest I had got in the shortest amount of time at that time. My friend who was there had gone off with her boyfriend after a couple of hours of being there and so I was left with all the other guys and we were drinking in a circle. I remember taking lots of shots, mixing spirits and downing many of my drinks at the boys’ request. I was having fun and thought it was all a laugh. A lot of the guys there I knew quite well and I had known some for 3 years and the others for 8 years, so I felt quite safe getting drunk with all of them as we all went to the same school at the time too and further I shared a lot of classes with the majority of the boys there. Then one boy, who I shared a class with and was friends with, asked if I wanted to go upstairs with him, and so I did. I remember walking up the stairs behind him, feeling so dizzy and out of control and my eyesight wasn’t straight. My heart was racing and I did not feel well at all. We got to the bedroom and spoke for a bit and then started getting off. We then went further, he put his hands on my boobs and he started to finger me. He got his dick out and pushed my head down onto it, and throughout this, I was still feeling really unwell and I knew I was not in the right state to do anything. This is when my memory and consciousness starts to fade away. I then remember lying with my back on this bed and drifting in and out of trying to stay awake. I’m pretty sure I was passing out or blacking out when he started having sex with me. I remember feeling him in me and penetrating me but I don’t remember or recall anything else other than the feeling of the bed beneath my back and that I just let it happen. I remember starting to gain a bit of consciousness and that I was about to be sick. I tumbled down the stairs as I found it hard to walk, and went to the loo and proceeded to be sick a lot. He came down to the toilet a minute after or so and then he kept saying ‘Can you just finish me off’ ‘Just suck me off’ ‘Quickly finish me off’, while I was hunched over crying into the loo vomiting, asking him if he could get my friend. I remember him coming closer to me and feeling me up and having his dick right by my face as he wanted me to suck it that badly and to ‘finish him off’. I kept saying no and crying and being sick but he kept insisting that I should. After a few minutes, he left in a strop and I was alone for a bit, crying and being sick. Another guy came in, his best mate and a guy everyone thought was a lovely, sweet and gentle, came in to see how I was doing and was being really nice to me. He started to rub my back which I really appreciated as I felt so ill and vulnerable, as I was still crying and being sick. After a while, he then moved his hand around my body from my back to my bum and to my boobs and started to squeeze them. My friend later came in to me asleep on the toilet seat and the friend with his hands on my boobs. She went livid and called for an Uber home. I don’t remember much after that but she took some pictures and videos of me in the Uber and I am passed out in the seat or I was just slurring all of my words. The next day I remember feeling so awful from all the alcohol I had consumed that what actually happened to me didn’t really cross my mind and my friend and I thought it was a funny one night stand and that was it. I never really thought about it again. We joked about what had happened as we both had sex last night, and she had to ask her boyfriend to ask the guy if he used a condom, which luckily he did. From then, I never really thought about it and subconsciously pushed it out of my mind. Little bits of the night came back to me as the days went on, but again I never thought anything of it.,Summer ended and we all went back to school. Everyone had found out by then what had happened and so on the first day of L6th I was questioned by all my friends about it and we all laughed because everyone saw it as hilariously funny, as to what everyone and I myself knew, it was a funny one night stand of two people who no one would expect. And that is was nothing different from that either. For the whole of Lower Sixth the guys made jokes about him to me and teased me about him, but I always laughed it off and subconsciously never think about it. Since he was the first guy at my school that I had done bits with, from then I always felt like an easy target for guys at parties and gaths, or seemed an easy pull after what had happened. I was fine with it then as I thought of it all as fun and games and I never really thought about any of it. As I said earlier, as time went on, little bits started to come back to my memory and that is also probably why I know a lot more now of what happened than I did back then.,It was only last night when I was speaking to a friend about all of the Everyone’s Invited and the experiences with boys we both had that it all suddenly came to me. We started talking about the incident and we both quickly realised it wasn’t ok or funny at all anymore. Even though it happened a few years ago now, I can’t believe I had not realised for so long what actually happened to me and how long it has been swept under the rug."""" ,""The culture out our sixth form was incredibly awful. With the tone set from the boys in upper sixth and lower sixth boys encouraged to follow in the path they set. Monday mornings were the worst times for many friends- where girls were ripped apart and judged by anything that went on, I’ve lost count of the number of friends that ran from the sixth form room crying on account of the boys, where they would just brush it off as “banter” or that the woman was “too sensitive”. The environment turned many women against each other, where the boys approval often felt essential to surviving the school. Because that is what is was, trying to get through each day, surviving. The leadership team brushed off many concerns of the girls, they seemed especially scared of “positive discrimination’” allegations. After leaving the school six years ago- it has been so sad to see that this environment has continued- from reading the testimonials on this page. The school has failed to address the issues time and time again. Enough is enough. This can’t keep happening",,
"When I was in year 9, a boy at my school grabbed me in the middle of the school field, put his hand over my mouth and forced me to watch a video of him m@sterbating. All of his friends pointed and laughed at me and I pushed him off. At the time (because of the boys reaction) I thought I was overreacting, I now (5 years later) realise how disgusting that is. Later that year the same boy would constantly expose himself to me around school. Again, his friends would point and laugh at my discomfort. Behaviour like this is so normalised in schools and it makes me feel sick that stuff like this (and plenty other counts of sexual assault) happened at school. There was a point where I would be scared to go to lessons because of it. This needs to change!!",,
"it was my 8th grade year during cheerleading season and i was walking between two schools to go to practice. we had just gotten our uniforms and we all decided to just wear them over and change in to our practicewear. as i was walking i heard a high schooler go “damn i’d tap that” and i looked over and looked around me, i was the only one out there and he said it loud enough for me to hear. i don’t know who it was and i don’t want to.",,
"I went to this college a few years back but I will never forget this incident. I was shy in school but I had a confident friend that was mouthy. This “friend” made a comment about a group of black guys from the sports team and they assumed that I was the one that said it me. On my break, my friend and I went to Sainsbury’s and the same guy followed after. One of the boys came behind me and rubbed himself on me and said “say what you said again”. I told the head sport teacher at the time and all he told the guy to do is to no longer approach me. He was allowed to stay in the school and that teacher did not even mention the situation to anyone .",,
"A boy fingered me against my will in order to go the furthest with a girl at party. They had a competition running during every party , treating girls like objects.",,
i was raped at age 15 by a boy in my class,,
I was in maybe year 9 quite insecure and got drunk with my friends for the first time. I was happy having a good time when we decided to travel and this boy decided to travel with us. He molested my chest in public my legs and was sticking his tongue down my throat. He was completely sober whereas I was not and he knew this as he kept on making repeated jokes. I asked him to stop and he would continue ignoring me saying we were having a good time. Nobody did anything to stop it.,,
"I was raped by someone I'd met on a dating app. The whole thing didn't feel real. Now it feels as if my life has split in two, the person I was before and the person I am after.",,
"I was with my one my friends coming home from a party, we had got to the last tube stop as it was really late so we had to get to the bus which seemed a bit dodgey at the time. We got on and it was fine (there were a few others on the bus) until this really drunk man got on, he was still drinking something can’t remember what and he came over to me and my friend and started trying to speak to us, he was so drunk that you couldn’t understand what he was saying. He then handed me his bottle and asked me to open it so I said no you’ve had enough and gave it back. Some other guy by this point noticed he was being weird and came and swapped seats with us but the drunk guy followed kicking the other guy out the way. We tried to ignore him but he kept talking to us and then proceeded to grab the back of my head and try and kiss me. I ripped my head away so fast and shouted no In his face. The bus driver noticed this and called the police to get him off the bus. They asked me if I wanted to press charges but I said no cos I didn’t see it as a big deal and I just wanted to go home.",,
it was in a geography lesson. He lifted my skirt and started running his fingers up and down my thigh. I felt so uncomfortable but i was so terrified that i couldn't tell him to stop.,,
"it didn’t happen in school, it was on a bus, but the person was from this school.",,
"You would be entirely correct in saying [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is integrally built upon the unadulterated wish for boys to show their sexual prowess through rape and assault. I recall their age old “theme tune” sung at rugby games including the lyrics: “I’m [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] till I die...fuck her sleeping, fuck her dying, if she had wings I’d fuck her flying” or something along those lines. Yikes",,
Systematically these schools do not support the female students. Knowing the countless number of assaults that happen and have happened there is still a disturbing ignorance and naivety that simply ‘educating’ the boys even further on sexual assault will stop them from doing it. There is a toxic relationship that the schools choose to ignore and continue to force survivors interact with their perpetrators in school events.,,
"I was 15, at school I was bullied, left out of everything, basically living a nightmare, so when I was invited to a party for once, I jumped at the opportunity to get royally pissed. Her parents weren’t home, and her dad had cases of whiskey, to which I drank too much. I ended up throwing up in her parents bathroom, breaking the toilet seat and passing out in her parents bed. I woke up to this guy on top of me, inside me. I was on my period and had a tampon in and told him to get out and he told me he could feel it. I felt disgusted and ran out of the room. Something important to note is I had had sex with him before, a few times and just now at the age of 18 am I realising that it was not always consensual. I had sex with him twice after the incident, to make myself feel better but I only really understood what had happened until a year later. I was still being bullied, completely depressed, I didn’t know what to do. I moved schools for sixth form and all was well, until a friend from my previous school invited me to a gathering in a field (this was about 3years later). I said I would come, but only if he wasn’t there. When we first turned up he wasn’t but we went to the toilet and came back and he was stood there. For the entire night he was staring at me whilst I was panicking and crying, trying to drink so I would forget what was happening. I try and live with it, but to be honest I’m scared all the time. It was yesterday that I found out at that party when I was 15 he was the one holding my hair back as I threw up.",,
multiple people have been touched inappropriately with inappropriate comments,,
"""I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend at the time. It’s been almost two years and it still plagues my mind. I was 15 and he was also 15 but he was sexually active by the age of 13. When we got into the relationship I told him I wanted to wait until I was a bit older or at least 16 but soon after my 15th birthday he started to try and persuade me into doing things that I didn’t want to do. I thought I loved him so I did the things he asked me to do. After a while I started to say no but then he’d beg me and say things like ‘Only one time, please just one time’ He also started to act distant and I found out later he was talking to other girls behind my back, one of whom he’s with to this day.,I only realised what he did last year, September time when we did a lesson on arranged marriages and the types of sexual assault and I’m still trying to work through what happened while he lives a normal life.""",,
"""I was 16 and was going on the tube and was sitting next to this woman . Beside the woman was this man who appeared to be a stranger to her. He put his arm around her , stroking her and was manspreading his legs , making sure they were touching hers. He was making suggestive comments towards her and it was obvious she was uncomfortable. The tube was quite full and some people were giving him dirty looks but the rest ignored it . No one said anything . I felt frozen and unable to do anything , I was scared that if I spoke up things would escalate and become violent .,I decided to get off at the next stop and give the woman a look to get off too , she followed me off the train and I went further down onto a different carriage but on the same train. She did the same . I shouldn’t have done that. ,Whilst I was sitting in the new carriage the same man was walking through in between the carriages and spotted me sitting down . I froze again and I physically couldn’t move . There was an empty seat opposite me and I felt sick because I knew he would sit there. But I couldn’t get up because I couldn’t feel my body . I thought that maybe these new people would stop him doing anything to me. But when he saw me he smiled and proceeded to sit opposite me and man spread his legs so they were touching mine. I tried to move my legs but he persisted to move his so that they kept touching mine. People were watching but they weren’t doing anything and again , no one said anything. ,I sat there for 3 stops until my stop because I was scared if I got off the train he would follow me and I didn’t know what would happen next.,When it reached my stop , before the doors closed I managed to quickly get out so he wouldn’t be able to follow me . I ran up the escalators to the exit and told the TfL attendent what had just happened., What scared me most was that the woman from before was still on the train and he would find her again and I didn’t know what he would do to her., Every time I think back to that situation I feel so guilty and so angry. I wish I stood up for that woman the first time and I wish I completely left the train and the woman didn’t follow me. A part of me feels like I made it worse and it was my fault but then again no one else did anything or said anything,Even now when I’m on the tube alone I still feel this sense of anxiety that I’ll see the same man again or something similar will happen to me and when I arrive at every station and I don’t see him , I feel a huge sense of relief.""",,

"i was forced into doing things i didn't want to do by someone i trusted, i've never spoke up about it because what difference would it make. these types of situations are never taken seriously.",,
"when i was 13 i started to chatting to a boy who was around a year or so older then me. when i began to properly fancy him he realise that i was extremely nieve and innocent. he then pressured me into having sex with him, he told me that it was normal and if i didn’t he’d leave me and tell everyone i did anyway. without my knowledge he recorded me whilst we were doing it and sent it to a group chat with his friends. the video was shared from this group chat and it eventually got back to people from my school. i was relentless bullied about it and nearly three years later the video is still being used against me. to this day i haven’t even been able to kiss someone because i’ve been to traumatised from this experience. i’ve never been able to go to any adult because i’m scared of being called a slut or being judged. even though the sex technically was consensual the whole experience has damaged me for life.",,
When I was in year 9 I walked home alone from my school which was only round the corner. I was then followed home by a white car and was cornered by the car when he thought I was crossing the road. Then was asked if I had a boyfriend and if I wanted one by a grown man. Luckily I was able to run home,,
"At 13 I was Snapchating this guy I met at a social - they increasingly got more sexualised and I was pressured again and again to send nude images when I refused/didn't give him what he wanted I was called frigid, verbally abused and was blackmailed to send more as he threatened to spread them around his school",,
I was 16 and a pupil at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] at the time when I decided to meet a man off of Grindr. I went to his flat and shortly after he let me in I started to get uncomfortable because I barely knew this person and it was the first time I’d ever done this. We went into his bedroom and I told him I wanted to stop. He ignored me then pushed me down on his bed and he told me to shut up and take it. He was physically a lot bigger than me and I was so terrified that I just closed my eyes and waited for him to finish (I also found out later he had stealthed me). Afterwards I felt so disgusting and dirty that I went home and sat curled up in my shower and cried. It took me a while to accept that I’d been raped because in my head the fact that I had chosen to go into his home and I hadn’t forced him off me meant I’d consented. I developed PTSD from the experience and it took me a while to get help for it - though I’m lot a better now. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.,,
"A guy that i was friends with kept begging me to have phone sex with him, i would constantly say no and expressed how i wasn't comfortable with that.

"I have experience sexual harassment and abuse many times. Including more than once when i was at school. With boys putting their hand up my skirt and grabbing my bum while i am walking, my boobs being grabbed and boys going between the buttons of my shirt to touch my boobs. Instead of doing something the school gave an assembly with all girls telling up how to dress and carry ourselves. My friend was punched in the face by a boy on a lunch break at this school and she was punished as well as him. He did not even get suspended!"",I know far too may boys and men who justify this as 'guys can only think about sex'. Grow up, and do better, so that we can all sleep at night.",,
"I was repeatedly abused by a boy in my school. He would take me into empty classrooms at lunchtimes and force himself onto me. He would grab, grope me and try to have sex with me. I was only 14. Sometimes he would get me to miss lessons to do this. I turned up late to my first real GCSE exam because of it. I reported it to the school when I was in year 11, and to the police. I decided to drop the police report because I was in the middle of my GCSE’s and had already missed three months of year 11 due to PTSD caused by the abuse. The school decided not to believe me, and made sure all of the teachers knew that I was “lying”. I am 22 now and I never speak to anyone about what I experienced at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] because I’m afraid they won’t believe me, just like how the teachers I trusted and reported these extremely serious instances of sexual assault and attempted rape to decided not to believe me. I reckon I was just too much paperwork for them to deal with, and I almost feel more resentment towards them than to the perpetrator. I later went on to be raped by another man and experienced two more physically, emotionally and sexually abusive relationships before I turned 20.",,
"Our schools held 'socials' for us on weekend, the boys would create moshpits to take the opportunity to grope us.

I told him to fuck off but he’s a strong guy was so hard to get past. He let me out the toilets and I didn’t even think anything of it for rest of the night. I told him that he couldn’t do that to girls and that he was lucky it was only me and not someone else. he said he thought it was fine because i’d kissed him in the past. I normalised and rationalised it at the time because didnt way to admit it was assault.",,
I was in pe in yr 9 and we were playing basketball with the boys and I was trying to get the ball from someone and then the next thing I know it that I have a hand on my boob. Later on I found out that the same guy that had touched me had also touched another girl on the butt.,,
"At 16 I got a job as a live in kennel assistant. One of the male members of staff, an older man about 50, went out of his way to befriend me. After a few weeks he invited me to his caravan as he said he wanted to draw me. I’d seen some of his drawings of the dogs and they were good so I said ok. When we were in his caravan he asked me to undo the buttons on my shirt which I did. Then he started to touch my clothes and adjust my bra saying he wanted it to look perfect for the portrait. He put his fingers inside my bra and touched my nipple. I was shocked but too scared to say anything. He did the drawing and I left. Then every day he made sure he was alone with me somewhere in the kennels and every day he touched me, starting with my breast and then working his way into my pants until he was inserting his fingers into me every day.

I finally succumbed to his pressure after about a month or two and sent one in my bra and pyjama bottoms. I was 13 years old and felt disgusted at myself. The girls at my school found out and made me feel really guilty about it he got no shit for it at all.",,

He agreed. I then met him and we went to get some food. We were having a good time and then I went to the bathroom. There was one toilet that was for everyone to use. I was coming out of the bathroom but as I was doing so he pushed me back in and locked the door behind us. He then said that he wanted me to toss him off as my end of the deal. He then pulled down his pants and I kept hesitating and saying no. I felt obliged cos he kept saying saying “aw come on” and I didn’t think I had a choice. He then grabbed my hand and basically wanked himself off while using my hand to do so. I felt so disgusted with myself and I constantly regret it.

It was clear I was getting very drunk and he saw me pass out on the road outside a club we were at, when I came around some girls were asking if I was with anyone and I said I wanted to find my friend. The girls took me back in the club and I found him. He had just left me unconscious on a side street at night. He then suggested that he get me back home because I was too drunk. He got in the taxi with me and came back to mine. I was reluctantly intimate with him because I felt awkward and that I should because he took me home. After we had sex he made some very upsetting comments about my body and my mental health, which have been ingrained in my brain since then. I then passed out and later woke up to him inside me and covering my mouth with his hand. My male friends still hang around with him despite them knowing about his shady past with me and other girls. I am now the one who has been excluded from the friendship group, not him.",,
"After a party we had gone to sleep. I was sleeping on the sofa bed with two guys who I knew, sleeping on the edge and facing away from either of the guys. I had been drinking and was at least a bit drunk by the time we went to sleep. The guy in the middle turned towards me while I was slept facing away and grabbed my hand from behind. He put my hand on his penis and started moving it up and down. I was still faced away and he was moving it up and down and using his hand to force mine around his penis. I didn’t know what to do and as a victim of sexual violence in both my child and teenage years, I just did what I was being made to do. It was the only way I knew to get through this type of situation. I finally gave up and turned around. He pushed my head down and once again I complied. The other guy woke up at some point and was obviously shocked at what was happening. After a couple of minutes I realised I didn’t have to do this and stopped. Said I didn’t want to and he got angry at me and was telling me to just finish. I turned around and went to sleep as there was nowhere else for me to go and he finished himself off. When we came back to school after the holidays, he decided to tell everyone I had sexually assaulted him in his sleep. He was a popular guy who had been at the school for many years more than me so everyone just believed him. Including my ‘friends’. Only one person ever thought to ask me if I was okay and back me. They know who they are and shout out to them. Needless to say I don’t really keep in touch with anyone from that school anymore.",,
"I'm 14 and already my friends and I are being catcalled, and people don't see it as that big of an issue. I've been told to just ignore it and it'll go away, even by close family members.

"When i was 10-11 I was really good friends with the neighbors next door. One day I went out to play with one of the kids, his brother, and his sister. We were in their room and started taking about stuff. One of the boys ask to see my boobs and me being a kid not knowing what's going on I lifted up my shirt and showed them. The two boys started touching my boobs and it made me uncomfortable but before I could do anything their grandma who was watching them that day came in. She blamed it on me and told me to be more lady-like and shouldn't have shown them my boobs.",,
"A friend played drinking games with me at a party, I didn’t know that he was doing shots of water instead of vodka like me. He then proceeded to pin me up against a wall, put his hand in my underwear and touch me. He would have got a lot further if one of my friends hadn’t come around the corner. Within an hour, I was labelled a whore and a liar. The next year it happened to another girl and the year after a girl said he raped her. All three of us as still called liars and sluts.",,
I got with a guy I’ve known since primary school just once. Since then he’s assumed that the one time was a free pass to whatever he wanted he’d randomly grab my boobs and then one time we were alone in his house and he’d gone to the bathroom. When he came out he grabbed the back of my head and wouldn’t let go pulling his trousers down telling me to give him head. After that on a separate occasion we hung out with another friend where I got intoxicated he then tried to rape me only stopping because the other friend had clearly heard me say no earlier as he also had a girlfriend.,,
"When I was 14 I was in a relationship with a guy who sexually coerced me to go further with him. He was a year older than me and whenever I told him I didn’t want to go further he would bring up the fact he’s the only one out of his friends that hadn’t, convincing me I owed it to him. Only years later did I realise this was sexual assault and that I should have never let him manipulate me in this way but I was young, intimidated and naive. One day I had enough of the constant pressuring and I gave in, I gave him head, during this he held my head down and forced me to swallow when I did not want to. Apparently this was not enough for him, he wanted to finger me. I told him on multiple occasions I was scared and did not want too but I gave into the pressure and was manipulated to the point that I believed I wanted to. It happened. I did not enjoy it and told him this during it but he continued.",,
"When I was 13 I went on a holiday with my family back home. We had a family friend come over all the time he was 21. One night he came up to me and randomly kissed me he was my first kiss I was confused and didn’t know he “liked” me. He proceeded to always pull me aside and kiss me and stuff. He always tried to touch me in my private place I always had to drag his hand back but one time he rubbed me down there really hard it hurt. I once gave him oral sex it happened so randomly I sat down and his thing was right in front of me I guess I felt compelled to. I repented so much to god after that. Now whenever I think about that time I feel disgusted with myself and him I’m 22 now and I would never never dare to even look at a child like that, I couldn’t it’s disgusting. Sometimes I don’t know if I was taken advantage of or if I really liked him, I thought I was so cool seeing an older boy but now I’m disgusted.",,
"When I was 20 (nearly 5 years ago), myself and my friend were holidaying in mainland Spain from Scotland (west) and my friend from England (south). We decided to get a hotel and visit Benidorm for a night. We could handle our drink well and we had only had one small drink when a group of older Irish boys came up to our table and started chatting with us. We were always up for a laugh and they seemed like they were too. They offered us a drink which we accepted and then the next thing I remember was one of them on top of me in a dark dingy apartment. I was in and out of consciousnesses, vomiting all over myself. I then woke up the next morning. In my hotel room with my friend next to me. We had realised we had been drugged and raped. I can’t believe it. How did we get back to the hotel? I was terrified inside but my friend and I tried to make light of the situation. We were covered in cuts and bruises and no recollection. I’m hindsight we should never have trusted strangers to get us a drink from the bar that we couldn’t see but what kind of people do that. The men were Irish and maybe late 20’s/ early 30’s. They said they were in the army and that’s all we knew. I didn’t report it because I just thought what proof do I have? And plus I would then have to tell my family. I think about it constantly and have opened up to a few friends about it but it lives with me and haunts me.",,
"I was on my way home from school one day, wearing my school uniform. I walked past a random middle aged guy and he started following me saying things like “looking good in that skirt” and “you’re going to be a real heartbreaker one day”",,
"When I was 14 I was dating a guy who was 17. It was only until many years later (I’m 21 now) that I realised that he had raped me multiple times and emotional abused and manipulated me. He would chase me around the house trying to put his fingers inside of me and I would beg him to please stop, he thought it was funny. Most of the time I would just give in and pretend I liked it so it would end quicker. This one time we were on the sofa and I was trying to get him off me and I ended up kicking him in the face giving him a nosebleed, he then said he would tell everyone I was an abuser and that I hit him. Sometimes when we would have sex “consensually” (I was 14) I would ask him to please stop bc it hurt, he would hold me down until he finished. This all happened sometimes multiple times a day nearly every day for a whole summer. He had my passwords for everything. If I said good night to him and he saw on WhatsApp that I remained online/was online 1min after he would call me a liar and a cheater and ask who I was talking to. He always put me down and made me feel worthless. When we finally broke up he told me he was going to kill himself. After we broke up he told everyone I was a slut and psycho. I found out that he was still talking about me to this day, 7 years later, telling my friends and people I knew that I was insane.",,
i was 7 he was my brothers friend who was 13. he used to ask if i wanted to play hide and seek and would always tell me the best hiding place was under the bed so when he found me there he would undress me make me lay on the bed and touch me. Each time he did more and more stuff until eventually he raped me. i didn’t realise it was wrong until i was in sex education class in year 9,,
"I was inappropriately grabbed whilst in an art room, I was year 9 and he was year 11. I have reported it to my school and they did nothing about it. They pretty much told me to get over it",,
When I was in year 12 a male old teacher (around 50) told me I was showing too much skin and that I can’t wear such an inappropriate outfit to school when I took off my jumper and was wearing a vest. I was left shaking and in shock. My friends also received extremely uncomfortable comments from this man and he was later fired,,
"Sixth form boys dating/preying on y9 girls was very normalised. Endless slut shaming towards girls from boys in one house, who would pursue and pressure girls to get with them and then laugh over it and speak badly about the girls.They would run a charity auction including bras they had stolen from girls they had gotten with. At school events, boys heckling and cat calling girls was laughed off and accepted. The privileged misogyny was insane and laughed off . Boys moved in packs and behaved awfully to girls and it was normalised.",,
"i was 14 years old and in year 10 when a boy in my physics class very unsubtly stared at my boobs and proceeded to as me, “how big are your tits?!”, which then prompted the other boy on our table to stare at my boobs. i’ve never felt more uncomfortable and ashamed about myself.",,
I was 8 in 4th grade and these boys from school would take me to empty rooms during lunch and pull down my underwear and pants. They would stick their fingers up my private part and lick it they would get my head and make me lick their private parts. They made me hump they while I was naked and they recorded when they would stick there fingers up my private part.,,
My gf recently moved back to uk after her mother passed away. She had been through alot and needed to be with her dad. She started college at newham and was studying health and sociai care course. She never made new friends but decided to hang out with this guy and girl in her class. They became really good friends really fast. There was this one day she went out drinking with them. He put something in her drink and she lost control at the pub. They all got on a bus back home. The( girl) friends home came first and then my gfs and then the guys. My gf slept and told the guy to wake her up when her house comes. What she didnt know is that she would wake up to him taking him to his house and telling her she should fresh up before she goes home or shes dead. She went home with him and drank a glass of water and passed out on the bed. She woke up to being completly naked and seeing a used condom on the floor. She wore her clothes and started shouting at him of angry and confusion and all he had to say was that she wanted it and that she was drunk. She ran back home . The guy blackmailed her for the next 3 months told her she shpuldnt do anything dumb or ignore him now or hes gona tell me that she cheated on me. She got so mentally screwed by this that she almost killed herself but at last told me everything 6 months later. She told me everything but we couldnt do a damn thing. She doesnt want people to know that she was raped. Even the word rape scares her. She wants justice but she cant do anything. Shes from a muslim family and drinkings basically very wrong between muslims. Its gonna cause her even more problems than shes going through rn if she tells something. We want justice but we cant do anything. And that breaks my heart. She cries every night and has a panic attack almost after every 2 days. Its really left a mark. Shes taking anti depressants now and has a therpist appoitmeng every now and then and its helping.,,
I was about 7 or 8 and he was about 8 or 9 at the time. I was at my god sister’s birthday party when she decided we should play hide n seek (the dark version). Me and the boy hid in the bathroom while all the rest of the kids hid somewhere else. We were in the dark and he was scared so he held my hand the entire time. She passed the door and went downstairs. He held my hand and led me to her grandmother’s bedroom where we hid in the closet. She continued to pass by and after about 5 minutes he turned and looked at me. Then out of no where he kissed me and just continued to kiss me. I was a little girl so I didn’t really know what was happening. As he started to reach in my shirt. He was touching all on my chest and idk why because I didn’t even have a chest to touch. He kissed all over my stomach and chest and it started to get weird. As soon as he stopped my god sister found us and I was relieved.Now that I am 14 I realize what he did was wrong. And I still feel violated till this day.,,
"I got blackout drunk at a party and passed out on the sofa. woke up a couple hours later to realise I was alone in the room with a guy I thought was my friend, and his hand was in my pants. I just remember feeling like my heart had stopped and desperately trying to think of a way out of the situation. I eventually pretended to ""wake up"" and got out of there as soon as possible. To this day I don't know what happened to me before I woke up. This has continued to affect me even three years later.",,
"I was only fourteen and at a party with loads of people from different schools. I stayed in a small circle with a few friends I knew from school for the majority of the party. I went to the toilet towards the end and when I came out I was cornered by this random guy. He took me out to the corridor and started touching me in inappropriate ways, my boobs, bum etc. He looked about a year older than me but I couldn’t tell who he was. I haven’t told anyone and have been scared to go to parties since.",,
first time catcalled. on a walk during around 6pm. 2 old men shouted out a car driving by. what was I wearing??? Christmas fluffy pj bottoms and a leavers hoodie. so yeh. the clothes are irrelevant.,,
"I was attacked by a group of boys who tried to pull my clothes off in the corridor, no teachers were around. I reported it immediately to the head of year and it was brushed under the carpet. The boys were never moved or punished.",,
"I was extremely drunk and this guy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was also drunk but not as drunk as I was. He sexually coerced me into doing sexual activities by saying that he liked me which I later found out was false and by giving me compliments. He even tried to have sex with me and asked several times, I didn’t give into that but I did everything else.",,
"My story is quite old - I’m in my late 30s now. [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is a Catholic secondary school and when I was there between [dates omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], sexual harassment and abuse of girls by boys (and some teachers, allegedly) was rife. Teachers completely ignored the daily harassment girls endured, which ranged from disgusting comments about girls’ bodies and perceived sexual experiences to unwanted touching and assault. It was constant. When I was 12, a boy in my class sexually assaulted me by pulling me under his desk and sticking his fingers inside my vagina. This was in class. He was also physically and verbally abusive - he punched me several times. He terrorised many girls and was the ringleader of a group of similarly abusive boys. Nothing was done about his behaviour. Absolutely nothing. The impact on me has been profound.",,
It's hard to explain this but there's this guy in my school that just grabs my thighs everytime I sit near him or he sits near me (we have assigned seats so we move around alot) there's even this one time I had to go to the restroom to eventually noticed that he had left a bruised hand print on my thigh from when he grabbed me that morning I just wish I could speak up but I've had trauma resulting to being scared of boys and men so I just sit there and say nothing cause I freeze up I just wish my life could be better for me but thnx to these moments at my school and on my bus I became depressed and suicidal cause it's my fault for not saying anything when I turn to a brick when it happens,,
"People comment on weight,gender,religions. I do not feel comfortable here.",,
"I had a female friend for most of high-school. she would always make jokes about wanting to have sex with me and some of her other friends. there was multiple instances of her trying to grab me in places. she would try to sit in my lap and move around. I told her no, so many times.",,
I was in a one year relationship at the time. It was New Years eve and I had drank quite a bit. My boyfriend at the time took my downstairs and started making me give him oral sex. Once he had finished he got up and walked away whilst I began to repeatedly be sick in the bathroom. He never once came to ask if I was okay and once I got up and entered the room where everyone else was he proceeded to ignore me for the whole night so I left.,,
i was getting with a guy who id been friends with for a while and i was so drunk i kept telling him i was gonna be sick... that was the last thing i remember so i must have passed out. I wake up to him telling people we'd had sex. I remember the light was on so surely he'd be able to see that i was not fully conscious... yet he proceeded to have sex with a pretty much lifeless body. He said he didn't think I was that drunk and neither was he. Although if he wasn't that drunk i'm sure he'd have been able to acknolwledge the state i was in.. He never apologised except for messaging me to make sure i wouldn't tell anyone about what he'd done and that i had consented to it all along.,,
"There sadly have been a few times in my life where men have taken advantage of me. The main one being my abusive boyfriend of 12 months at 15 years old. A few weeks into the relationship, he and his friends spiked my drink at a bbq and that night i unconsensually lost my virginity. He began to hit me and torture me in the coming months, blaming it on his stress over gcses. Eventually, when i decided to end the relationship, he came to my house and raped me in my own bed. Several months later, my male best friend took advantage of me while i was asleep. After years of trusting him and telling him my trauma, he also used me for his own wants and ""needs"". And most recently, on the train to school in the morning, a drunk man called me a ""sexy missus"" and followed me off the train and to my boyfriend's car, where he stared in the window at me and kept smiling. I'm terrified of men, yet i'm expected to give them all the benefit of the doubt. How can i do that, when even those i have trusted have hurt me?",,
I was bullied for 2 whole years throughout yr7 and half of year 8 im still in yr8 and nothing was done about it nobody should go through stuff like this and when the teachers didn't do nothing about it it got gradually worser which caused fights From S.A,,
I was 7 the first time I was sexually assaulted. A new boy had joined my class and was told to sit next to me. He would then spend everyday for the whole year placing his hand up my skirt or dress and in my underwear to feel around and play around with my vagina. He would also force my hand into his trousers and use my hand to rub his private areas. I was SEVEN. I knew it was wrong but I was always too scared to say anything because I felt that no one would believe me or that I would be labelled as someone who was easy or asking for it. There was always an extra teacher that sat at our table to help him because he was foreign and I thought they would notice but they never did or they never spoke up about it. That was the year I started getting in trouble at school because I would do anything to not be at that table and preferred to be sent to the head or the corner to look at the wall. No one realised it was my way of lashing out so I wouldn’t have to deal with what was happening to me.,,
"One night on a school trip a group of boys were shouting very inappropriate comments at my group of (girl) friends and I (which I won't repeat cause people will know who I am). It made us very uncomfortable and slightly scared but we tried to just ignore them and run away, but then one of them assaulted one of the girls. Despite the head of year finding out about this after, the only punishment given was to just one of the boys and it was a detention. Pretty much the whole year group found out about it and some of the boys continued to make jokes to the girl who was assaulted about it.",,
"As a kid, i was a victim of sexual abuse, in the form of forced stripping. This led to unresolved trauma reactions when i was a teen, where i had no boundaries surrounding my naked body. I told one boy what had happened and the next week he begged me for nudes, and then showed his girlfriend at the time. These patterns persisted and at one point my school found out. They knew both me and the biys names yet chose to call my parents and let the boy off free. I had so many rumours spread about me, some which were spread by my own friends. I was slutshamed and peaople that knew nothing about me. I was groomed online and to this day unsire about where photos of me as a minor are on the internet. Living with the fear i could be exposed to everyone i know is crippling.",,
there is a boy who used to go to my school and he would slap girls asses and say things about girls which made us uncomfortable the teachers never said anything and my art teacher even said we were flirting with each other which was definitely NOT what was going on luckily he was expelled but i've found out he's coming back to school next year which pisses me of,,
I was touched and raped by a boy 6 yrs older than me in primary,,
Pretty tame compared to the other testimonies but my first boyfriend would push my head down when we were kissing to try to make me give him head. Luckily he never outright forced me but it’s gross that he never explicitly asked whether I was even interested in giving head. These boys feel entitled to sexual gratification without the willing participation of their partner.,,
"Last year during lockdown, I lived in a shared house of young people. We had a party one evening where we had a lot to drink. I went to my room, and one of my housemates came in and started kissing me. I was too drunk to know what was happening and just went with the flow. He started to have sex with me and I quickly sobered up and realised what was happening. I asked him to stop and he ignored me. I said I wanted to go outside and he ignored me. I asked where my other housemates were and he ignored me. I spent the entire time crying and he only left when another housemate came to check on me. I had to move house the next week, I have slept with my door locked ever since, and I had to have all the testing and jabs to prevent getting STIs. My best friend stopped talking to me because she said I shouldn’t have been drunk and I should have tried harder to stop him. I’ve been having therapy from a charity ever since.",,
"Was at a friends house in a different uni city, was way too drunk and went upstairs to go to sleep for a bit. The boy who had been forcefully moving to me all night followed me upstairs, tried to initiate sex and when I repeatedly said no and for him to leave told me to “relax, I’m not going to rape you”. I was too drunk to get up and leave, and although he left the comment alone made me feel sick for days on end.",,
A year ten raped a year seven in the school bathrooms,,
"When I was 16 I went to a party, a boy lead me off while I was too drunk to support myself. He lead me into the road and took all of my clothes off on the grass, he then assaulted me, I remember there was a house right near us and hoping they would come out, when I saw friends looking for me he wouldn’t let me get dressed until I promised we could do it again back at the party, as soon as we got back he lead me to a tent and assaulted me while I cried. This was my first time, he was friends with everyone, so I lied and got called a slut for sleeping with someone in a tent.",,
"I was in year 10 at the time and walking up an empty flight of stairs from the bathroom when a student in the year above entered the building and started walking up. I thought nothing of it until he ran up the stairs and started touching my ass. When I told him to stop and try to get away he said he had pics up my skirt that he took that he would share if I ever told anyone. This is the first time I’ve ever said anything about it"",I felt like I had been turned into a joke. For example, a group of boys from school then decided to collectively like all of the photos on my instagram account at the same time. Judgement also came from the girls in my year, many of whom ignored or avoided me for the year and a half that followed.,I found it hard to get up and go to school every day, and my self worth progressively deteriorated.",,
I had my nudes shared round the whole school the guy also told everyone I gave him a blowjob even tho we’d never met outside school. A boy at a party forced me to touch him and told everyone we slept together. I was shamed whilst he was praised. I had a friends older brother (18) force me (15) to stay awake after a party until I kissed him. He kept me up for 4/5 hours shaking me when I feel asleep until I gave in and he tried to make me touch him too. Our head boy raped a girl and was racist to a guy before he became head boy and the school knew and didn’t care. A boy used to wank next to me every single french and Spanish lesson. My heart races just thinking about all of it.,,
"In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I met a man 6 years younger than me while at university. He was not a student, but had friends who were at my university and on my course. I started to date him and we continued to date for nine years until we married in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. My husband I could only describe as ‘Mr Nice’ he is the type of man who people always think of as the ‘hero’ the man who will stop and help a women in distress. Nobody would think him capable of misogyny and yet he secretly drugged me, anally raped me, made a video of it and added the footage with other misogynistic sexual acts performed by other men with some women aware and some not aware they were being filmed. The separate video clips were added to an amateur film titled ‘Womb Wrecker’ The video was sent to his mobile phone via an app that deletes itself as soon as it’s viewed. It was sent to him by one of his friends and I accidentally opened it as I was napping and woke up sleepy, thought I’d picked up my phone and watched the shocking truth. It was reported to the correct authorities and my testimony has been documented several times but not acted upon due to “lack of evidence” I left my husband and he refused to sign divorce documents on the grounds of “ unreasonable behaviour”. I have yet to divorce him....now it will have to be on the grounds of being separated for 5 years or more. However, I’m still scared of him. He is with another family and could be doing this all over again. It is an absolute disgrace that the women I’ve disclosed to believed me, but it was the men in the power to act or question him, who didn’t. My experience left me fearful, angry, anxious and suspicious of just about every man’s motives. Thankfully, through counselling and realising I’m not alone, I survived to share this testimony with your platform. Thank you so much for providing this for women who feel let down by systems that often don’t protect women at all.",,
"my ex boyfriend used to touch me without my consent and when i told him to stop he would always say ""yeah 2 mins"" and then he made me touch him which i didnt want to do but he forced my hand",,
"In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I was a speech therapy student at the Central school of speech and drama. I went out on a date with a 2nd year drama student, and when I arrived at his flat a male member of staff who taught 'movement' was there too. We drank together, and I believe I passed out (never before or since with the alcohol I had drunk). I drifted in and out of consciousness to find these men taking turns to have sex with me. I am now considering reporting these men, both whose names I know.",,
A male doctor told me I looked good on my back whilst I was topless laying down for a breast examination. I was 15,,
"During my first and only year of uni, I had a very unhealthy relationship with sex. I was riddled with depression and anxiety so in my eyes, a guy being attracted to me equated with self worth. Similarly I drunk my problems away. Many occasions, I would black out and wake up next to strangers. To this day I'm unsure if i was drugged or not but to my dismay most occasions, I had slept with them (or so I was told) being a quiet shy type I used to embrace the ""hoe"" label and would joke about it as a defence mechanism. But now looking back I realise how fucked up it is. It's only once I made some good friends, they had told me how guys would follow me home and try to sleep with me. It's disgusting and thankfully I'm in a much better space now what frustrates me is the fact that at the time I thought it was ok",,
"2 years ago I was walking with a friend through [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], late morning, after a meeting and coffee, and while she unlocked her bike I was standing chatting to her, a man in his 30s or so passed and groped my bum.

"On a school trip in Year 9 (13 years old) with the local boys school, I was walking down the corridor of the hotel with my friends and one of the boys came up to me and put his hands on my boobs. He grabbed them and said “they’re the perfect size, a handful, you don’t need any more than that”. Him and his friends laughed and then walked off.",,
i was 11 so was he. he’d make me do stuff with him. stuff i didn’t like. it would make me feel dirty and disgusting. i felt so alone and he understood my vulnerabilities and export them.,,
"There was a narrow path leading from one of the girls boarding houses to the tuck shop area and on to the classrooms. One guy would stand at the far end of the narrow path at the end of break times when the girls would have to walk down that path. He would bend over mooning the girls with his penis and balls hanging between his legs whilst the girls had to walk towards him. When the girls got to that end of that path he would turn round grabbing his penis making masturbation gestures. All the guys and even girls hanging round the tuck shop area would either laugh or ignore him. It was only done to some girls, and done to humiliate them or as part of “banter”.",,
"A boy who had been a close friend at the time forced me to give him head, I’d stayed over after a night out because he had said everyone was going back to his (untrue) and I was meant to be sleeping at a girl friends but she had kicked everyone out, I was drunk and very sleepy / drifting in and out but he would say he wouldn’t let me sleep until I’d give him head and knelt on top of me and forced it into my mouth, I also woke up with him inside me, he also blocked the door and shoved my face down to not let me leave. He then told everyone at school we had had sex. It still affects my sex life to this day (nearly 5 years later)",,
I once had sex with a guy and it was rough and made me bleed. I was in a lot of pain which was expressed but he didn’t let me go to sleep until he finished. I also woke up with bruises. At the time I didn’t even think it was bad.,,
I was sexually assaulted in a public place by a fellow student. I later found out he had done the same to another girl in our year group.,,
"My first night out I just wanted to have a good time. Found out later that some of the guys in my halls, who I had first met that day, had a bet going to see who could get with me first.

"I was in year 9 (14yr old) and was sitting in a small room with a group of boys who I thought of as friends and I thought they saw me as equals and friends just as a boy would be to them. They started making jokes about my body (specifically my breasts) and commented on how funny it would be to rape me, touch, and do sexual things with me. One of them then turned off the lights in the room and they all started to get closer and try to touch me. My boyfriend of the time was in this room and didn’t say anything to stop their comments, but did stop them from getting touching me, and then they boys said because I was ‘his property’ they wouldn’t",,
"I was on my way home from school in year 6 and I got stopped by some people and they knew my name and I didn’t know them. They called me slut and whore and tried to touch me, not letting me go past. Luckily some adult saw and helped me out but that day was one of my scariest days.",,
This boy called [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] at my school started saying a lot of sexual things to me I felt very uncomfortable so then I had a meeting with the vice principal and head of year he only got isolation for 2 weeks then when he came back out of isolation everything got worse I was disgusted upset and angry I was nervous to tell anybody but with the courage of my mom my sister my friends I told a teacher. And I also went to the police but just today alot of pupils accused me of lying about the sexual harassment one of the girls said ‘it’s not sexual harassment because he didn’t touch you’ she was victim blaming me she screamed at my friends and I I was sick to my stomach I obviously started crying I was angry but also really hurt so many people talked behind my back. That’s why I’m leaving the school the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] never helps the victim they did the bare minimum to help me.,,
"My ex-boyfriend and I agreed to remain friends after we broke up. When I went to visit him he had heard rumours that I had been seeing another guy. He was jealous and kept on trying to kiss me. As I tried to leave his room he blocked my exit and pushed me up against the wall. He said no one would ever love me like he did and tried to take my trousers off, begging me to have sex with him. I said no 4 or 5 times, telling him I wanted to leave. I wanted to get away from him so badly I finally said yes. He took it as consent, some people would say it was, but I clearly didn’t want to. I cried all the way home and my whole body ached. I had been with him so many years I didn’t think it would effect me as deeply as it did. A few weeks later, he assaulted me in a club. He came up behind me, grabbing my waist and my ass and then ran away. When I found him outside the men’s bathroom, I said you can’t touch me whenever you want I’m not yours anymore, you shouldn’t grab anyone like that for that matter. He told me to go fuck myself.",,
"""I was sexually assaulted by my swimming coach. Between the ages of 6-9. I only began to realise what he was doing to me when I learnt about sex, only through personal research. Not Sex Ed.,I have been filmed having sex, the video has been shared multiple times, all without my consent. I was 15. I have also had nudes shared from when I was 15. Also without my consent.,I agreed to meet up with a guy from bumble. He was working at the time but previously had been to Pangbourne. We had sex that night and I stayed over. I woke up to him touching me, I asked what he was doing and turned over. I confronted him later and he apologised but pleaded with me not to tell anyone and ruin his life.,This has happened to me 2 other times. I have woken up to a boyfriend (someone I trust) touching me or trying to have sex with me. Each time they blamed it on me because they said they wanted to have sex and I was too frigid.""",,
"Since year 7 I had been touched inappropriately by a boy in my year he would touch my thigh under the desk in every lesson or stroke my back if he were sat behind me and would send sexual messages after school aswell. This happened all throughout school until year 9 when I finally snapped and told the teacher, they told me it wasn’t a good enough reason to have him excluded. I’m still not over the situation and it’s affected me greatly including the other girls he’s done this too",,
"I was assaulted by a close friend when I was 14. She harassed me and repeatedly touched me inappropriately for hours, then held my face and forced me to drink from a bottle of gin and finally pinned me down and fingered me against my will. I’d tried to stop her throughout, but she’d trapped me in her attic and taken my phone so I had no way to leave or call for help. Because we were both girls, I felt like what happened wasn’t real/didn’t count. We had been good friends, and I was only fourteen at the time, so of course I was shocked and traumatised, and so it took me a while to really process what had happened. I kept it to myself for months afterward, until my mental health got so bad that I was having panic attacks every day at school, became reliant on alcohol for social situations, and would sleep upwards of fourteen hours a day to avoid having to think about it. My relationships with my friends/family broke down, my grades dropped dramatically and I stopped all extra-curricular activities or hobbies because I was so tired all of the time and could no longer find any joy in things I used to love. I haven’t been able to have sex or masturbate since without breaking down in tears. To this day I haven’t told any adults what happened or received any proper help, as I’m not yet eighteen and so confidentiality is limited and I know my parents would react badly if they found out. I still go to the same school as her, and regularly have nightmares where I relive that night. I was diagnosed with anxiety about a year after it happened, but my parents don’t believe in mental illness, so I can’t access any therapy/medication. I’m struggling every day",,
"When I was 16, a man groped me in a big crowd in London. I believe the same happened to my friend but we were too embarrassed to say anything or to call the men out. In campus accommodation during the first weeks of my first year at university, the boyfriend of someone I was sharing a kitchen with also intimidated me. I said I wanted to go. He got aggressive, put his arm up against the wall in the corridor preventing me from leaving the building and said he would fuck me up. His girlfriend arrived, they argued, and he let me go but I was terrified. I felt that if I had been alone, I could have been (sexually) assaulted. I do not recall reporting what happened but I was called in to see a university representative, to which another flatmate accompanied me, so someone must have reported the incident. I was underage at the time and too embarrassed to say much. The girlfriend of the person who did this moved out of my corridor shortly thereafter. A few months later, I started to take a higher year course within my department and thought he was in the same small class. I felt completely terrified again, never returned and dropped the course. I could not be 100% certain he was the same person as I had not seen him for a long time, so I did not tell anyone. But if he was and he was a university student, the University should have made sure classes would not overlap. I was not made aware of steps if any the University took so I do not know whether appropriate disciplinary measures were taken. While I was a university student out in a club and had been drinking, a guy also walked over and stuck his tongue in my mouth. I was so taken aback I did not push him away. He then also proceeded to put his finger beneath my skirt in my underwear and vulva at which point I pushed him away. This disturbing event was unfortunately my very first ""kiss"". Prior to that, at age 13 or 14, I was walking to my bus stop to go to school. It was early morning, still dark, and there was nobody in the street. Just before getting to my stop, there was a man standing in the garden of one of the houses, naked and masturbating while looking at me walking past. I was terrified I may get raped. I made it to the bus stop and put my bag down, ready to run if he were to come my way. He did not and the bus arrived. I was scared for the remainder of the year when walking past the house and a neighbour had to accompany me to the bus stop every morning with their large dog.",,
"I come to school to learn, to be safe and instead this is what happens. No, I didn't ask for it and no, no one should EVER touch you without your consent. The fact that it happened at school is just the icing on the cake. Its despicable.",,
"I had to move away from this school because of how bad the sexual abuse got from most of the boys, it was like a different world where everyone treated us like objects and no one did anything. I was assaulted, groped, hurt and humiliated by everyone. It wasn’t just me, I wasn’t alone, every single girl in that school was in the same boat, we weren’t human to them.",,
"We'd made out in a club in first year of uni and he kept asking me to come back to his. I said no, but eventually he got me back to his room on the offer of some ""water"". We ended up on his bed and he kept trying to finger me, and despite me physically trying to move his hand away and asking him to stop, he kept going. Whenever I tried to get up and leave, he wrapped his arm around my waist to pin me back down on the bed - he played rugby so was a lot stronger than me. I really believe he would have raped me if my friend hadn't knocked on door of his room to get me (I hadn't texted when I left the club). After the incident, it clearly went around the college, or at least a version of the story, and I had people call me a ""bike"" behind my back on multiple occasions. I was slut shamed for the rest of the year by his friends and it took me a long time for me to stop blaming myself for being too drunk, too naive. It also took me a long time to thank that friend because I was too embarrassed by what happened. I hope they know how much it meant to me.",,
TW: when he said he was going to kill himself and i was so worried for him i actually threw up. and then a week later he continued to ask for nudes saying it would help him feel better. i didn’t want to him to do something drastic so i sent them,,
"VWhen I was in the first year at uni I was in a not relationship with a slightly older guy who would touch me while I was sleeping, have anal sex with me without lube or asking and give me huge amounts of drugs then have sex with me when I was hardly conscious. Apart from that I was stealthed (condom removed without consent), had men continue after I said it hurt and was face fucked so hard I lost my voice at a party in the student co op by an ex [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] medical student who runs a very popular student club night 🙃 a lot of this stuff made me feel weirdly distant from my body and disconnected from the world and would take me a while to even understand that what was happening was wrong",,
"In class the guy sitting next to me began poking me with his pencil on my boobs and lower stomach while laughing with his friend, he poked me between my legs and clearly knew what he was doing as they made jokes about penetration. I also know many girls have been groped at this school and its disgusting!!!",,
"The boys would talk about raping girls and who they would like to rape, but when told that those thoughts are disgusting and unacceptable, they would just reply with the typical response of ""it's just a joke, relax"".",,
"When I was at school, I was a cathedral choir boy. Age 14, one of the cathedral staff (he was about 25 y/o) took me for a drive in his car. He stopped in a deserted car park and exposed himself. He told me I was going to suck him off. I said that I didn't want to and he grabbed my head and pushed my mouth towards his dick. I tried to pull away but he kept pushing until I did it. I reported it at the time, but nothing ever happened. I am not the only person who has been a victim of sexual abuse at the cathedral, but our stories have never resulted in any formal investigation.",,
i never saw it coming. he was my friend.,,
"I was groomed by a 16 year old boy when I was 12 and just started high school, he forced me into oral sex and told me that's what happens when your in a relationship, I'm now old enough to understand that it is not how it works",,
"I went home with a boy after a night out, This was someone who I had done this with a few times before. He started to have anal sex with me, I told him no and he did it anyway. I pretended I needed the toilet and went upstairs, he followed me and continued to rape me anally. This was confusing for me because I had agreed to have sex with him and I didn’t realise at the time that he had raped me. I think if you spoke to him he wouldn’t realise he had done anything wrong. I tried having anal sex with my current partner and burst into tears even trying so this has definitely effected me.",,
"5 of my friends have been raped by this one boy in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He makes them drink a lot of alcohol and then when they pass out, he has sex with them without a condom. He has also been extremely inappropriate with other girls but we don't know the extent to which he has abused people. Nobody is doing anything to help.",,
"I had just turned 15 and me and my friendship group were getting attention from 18 year old boys. I was young, naive and thought it was normal. I started dating one of the older boys, I was flattered by the attention and was excited as he could drive and had his own car. I was in bed with him as my friend was in another room with her boyfriend. We started kissing and he started trying to put his hand down my pants. I said “no” about 4 times as he persistently tried to finger me. I just gave up saying no and he did it, I remember being in so much pain and that I bled after. After it happened I didn’t tell anyone as I thought that it was supposed to hurt and that was normal as id never done anything sexual with a boy before. I also remember that he bragged about it to his friends. This boy has been known for forcing a lot of younger girls into doing stuff they didn’t want to do after me. From experiencing this at such a young age it made me have such a warped perception of how I should be treated by men, it has taken me years to realise what happened was sexual assault",,
"A male computing teacher was hired. He walked into my class to grab some books. Bare in mind this a class full of girls. He got a boner over a class of 13 year old girls. Our teacher told us to ignore his boner. This has happened on multiple occasions. someone took a photo one time, we had photographic evidence of this teacher with a boner around kids aged 11-16. They did nothing. He worked there for a year. My school hired a paedophile, we all felt disgusted, unsafe and uncomfortable.",,
I was bullied and sexually assaulted at this school and nobody did anything and it was for four years straight I still am scared to go back to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] for that reason one of my best friends killed her self I knew who made her do it so I told the teachers they said it's already been done so why create more drama she is probably grieving to my parents done nothing and I got abused at home as well everyday I have been raped abused and even the teachers bullied Me and didn't care even the principle,,
I hate having to watch the boy that groped me in year 8 in the school building whilst I was wearing school uniform post pictures of him with his girlfriend. This girlfriend posts multiple feminist anti rape culture etc things to her story yet is unknowingly going out with my assaulter,,
"The first rape threat I received wasn't from the grown men on the streets who I was taught to be scared of. It was the boys in my class, talking about my ass and tits and how much they wanted to rape me - when we were all just twelve.",,
When I was about 13 I remember a group of boys from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] pushed each other in to me as I was walking home from school. They were laughing and jeering at me. I remember feeling very small. When I was 18 I was raped by someone who had gone to this school too. Hearing about rape culture it's made me think about how the trivial incident when I was 13 is all part of a bigger culture and not so trivial.,,
"I’m 8th grade during math and English I would be sexually assaulted and harassed for 5 months until I was able to tell an adult. I’ve regretted telling everyday since they all told me I was lying, including the assistant principal. Using the excuse it wasn’t on camera as a way to deny it happening. Though I wasn’t the first person he did this to and probably won’t be the last.",,
"I was dating this guy and sent him a nude pic. I broke up with him a couple of months later and I thought that would be the last of it. A while later I started receiving messages from his friend. He had the photo and started blackmailing me with it, saying that if I didn't sleep with him he would share it everywhere and tag me. He forced me to go to his house so we could negotiate him deleting the pic. He ended up raping me. I was 16 and he was 22.",,
"The lad culture at my high school was horrible. Sharing explicit in group chats, targeting really young students at parties. The boys outweighed the number of girls and you could tell. The ‘sex education’ we received was laughable which didn’t help. Consent was a non-existent line and it was always the girls fault.",,
"Recently I was out with a friend (she’s 15). We went out for five guys (about 7/8pm in winter) but as soon as we walked out the doors a car was waiting outside. They rolled down their windows and stared for a couple of minutes before speeding off. They proceeded to drive around the car park 5 times, coming back to us every time shouting and whistling. The security noticed and we waited, took us inside and they parked outside again for another half an hour before they left. I was wearing baggy jeans and a long sleeve top.",,
"In year 4, I had a boy pull up my skirt and touch me, and when the school was informed, they chalked it up to ‘boys being boys’. i got bullied for years after that",,
"Hello, I don't know why im doing this but I was assaulted in school by someone in the year above me i dont know who they are but i was walking home and they grabbed me and touched me and told me i was playing hard to get. Im scared to walk home and i never walk that way anymore.",,
The boys think they can touch the girls and it’ll just be for fun. I’ve been touched so many times but if I told someone I’d be made out as the culprit and the teachers don’t care.,,
"At school, a fellow male classmate used to expose himself on regular occasions to me as a “joke”. He asked me to do the same and I said no repeatedly, he forced his hand down my skirt and said “what are you going to do?” I was 7 years old.",,
There’s so many male teachers at school that decide to look at girls arses when they walk past but nothings done about it. They ignore our claims and say ‘we are being over dramatic’. It’s not right.,,
I got assulted,,
"[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I myself have had many experiences, which breaks my heart to hear myself say, judging I was 14-17. On multiples accounts I would be pressured into doing sexual acts and cornered as if I was the bad person and I was being horrible and unjust if I blue balled them. The fact that this happened to myself a couple times AND so many strong women I know, in the same school just shows how the crowd mentality is dysfunctional.,It is not the physical manipulation (I’ve had my head pushed to give head, people groping, and physically being in places which you can’t run away from) but it is the psychological abuse. Making someone else feel like less of a person just because you don’t want preform a sexual act is so beyond awful, and worse not only in person but the mass amount of guys asking for nudes and again, making you feel a worse person for not. It needs to be addressed and the lasting effect it can have on self confidence and intimacy is real",,
"I attended a Grammar School in [location omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] between 1971 and 1978. It was a time when corporal punishment was allowed. I was ""caned"" by the headmaster. I was made to remove most of my clothing except for my shirt, I was told to put on a very tight pair of gym shorts, bent over the headmasters desk while he groped my bottom and genitals. He spent some time playing with the shorts to arrange them to his satisfaction and then caned me ( with no witness ). In my final year he committed suicide by shooting himself with a shotgun in the Headmasters Lodge. I have subsequently discovered that he had sexually abused another pupil who was a boarder at this school. I was also groomed by an art teacher in my final year ( who I first met when I was 14 who left for a year or two and then returned ). This individual used to buy me alcohol and I eventually had sex with him at the age of 17. This person has left me with many issues concerning my sexual identity, gender and addiction. I am also aware that he has abused other young men in the same way. It's taken me decades to come to terms with what happened to me and has almost ruined my life. I've been in touch with him until a couple of years ago when he cut communication with me - I guess he is afraid of being found guilty of historic sexual abuse. Sexual, physical and psychological abuse really ruins a child's life and takes the rest of his or her life to recover. This must stop.",,
"During my time at this school, I was sexually assaulted on school property by three different boys on multiple separate occasions who refused to believe I didn't want to go further than kissing, called me a 'dyke', 'lesbian', 'frigid' and spread vicious rumours about me which affected my friendships, my academic focus and my mental health. The previously all-boys school culture was still heavily weighted to 'boys club' mentality, with locker room talk being commonplace and many girls being slutshamed, driven to eating disorders and self-harm, and unwanted pregnancies being terminated. New girls were 'rated' as they walked into chapel, with boys calling out scores out of ten, and female teachers were targetted with sexually explicit threats and catcalling. The culture among girls was equally nasty, with bullying, taunting and teasing in the girl's boarding house and a 'mean girls' clique - I can see now they were doing what they needed to survive in a boys world, but it messed a lot of girls up for a long time. I'm pleased to see that the school is making efforts to stamp out this culture and I hope it's a lot better now for the current students than it was for us.",,
"Boys would wrap their arms around my waist, grope me and make comments about my body, even those who I was friends with would talk about me behind my back. The teachers didn't give them any formal sanctions, because in their opinion, boys were ""just being silly"", they completely got away with it.",,
"""When I was about 21 I went to the bank to discuss getting a mortgage. The advisor was an older guy and he took me into a meeting room to discuss the details. As soon as the door closed I felt uncomfortable, he sat right next to me and started asking if I had a boy friend and what kinds of things I liked doing in my spare time. He brushed the air from my face and talked about my earrings and I was honestly just paralysed with fear. I started looking around the room thinking ‘ how am I going to get out of here, he’s going to hurt me’. After about half an hour the ‘mortgage’ discussion came to an end and I left. I felt sick, called my mum who said she was coming to ‘kill’ him ( metaphorically obvs) but I just persuaded myself that I had imagined it. ,I can’t believe now that I went on to take the mortgage from this bank!""",,

I'd seen a boy who I fancied was in Leeds and he usually lived quite far away so I messaged him and he asked to come over. I agreed and let him into my accommodation Id previously messaged this boy sexually and I did fancy him at first I was fine that we were having sex until he got really rough and I asked him to stop and he wouldn't. I asked him multiple times and he just got rougher I froze and just let him do it. When it was over I just rolled over and cried myself to sleep I woke up and he was still besides me when I woke up I was covered in bruises and I felt dirty. I've never told anyone as I didn't feel as though anyone would believe me. I still to this day don't understand if I was raped or if I deserved it. Two years later I still think of this daily and I still feel dirty and have trust issues with men.",,
A boy named [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] touched me up all over and I had no words in my mouth to say stop,,
I was in a relationship where I was raped and sexually assaulted multiple times on school grounds in a full busy boarding house. I don’t know if anyone knew because I never mentioned it for risk of causing a fuss but god I wish I head,,
had a guy tell me he’d rape me so nobody else would because it would be ‘homo’ if they did the same after him. he genuinely thought he was being sweet to ‘protect’ me like that.,,
"On a night out i got talking to a guy who recognised me after we’d matched on tinder. that was the last thing i remember before i blacked out - i felt very very drunk really quickly and i don’t know if my drink was spiked. i woke up in bed with him the next morning, with no idea who he was or where i was. i was covered in cuts and bruises and he told me that i’d been falling over loads in the club and was eventually kicked out because i was so clearly intoxicated. none of this felt unusual to me - something told me this wasn’t right at first, but i brushed this aside, probably because i didn’t want to accept the fact that i had been raped. we were talking for a bit and went on a really awful date some time afterwards, when i said no to a second date he got really pissed off and demanded to know why i turned him down. it wasn’t until a few weeks after the date that i was thinking about the whole thing again and i asked myself how i would have reacted if the same thing had happened to my best friend. it wasn’t until then that i accepted the fact that i had been raped.",,
"A lad from my year at school wouldn’t leave me alone, and he came back to my house after school even though I didn’t want him to and he grabbed me and tried to get me to kiss him and get in bed with him.

"When I was in year 9, after a kind of lower school prom I was waiting outside to be picked up. A guy I hardly knew from my year sat on the curb next to me and put his hand round me and squeezed my breast. I pushed him away but he kept pursuing me. After I shoved him on the ground he finally got the message",,
I was raped from around the ages of 5-8 by a boy who used to attend my school (he is now 21). i was also sexually harassed by someone who used to attend my school but has now been made to leave (not because of my situation).,,
"When I was a freshman I had a relationship with a boy a year older then me.It was good fun love and i felt like he was my escape from home.I confined in him and i truly felt as if it were love.After a year of dating or so he started pushing the idea of sexual acts and sex itself. I told him I wasn’t ready yet as I really wasn’t. He pushed it for over a month until one day he offered to walk me home after school. I was still under the impression that I was in love so I said yes. A few steps away from the school towards the fields and the small forest they have he grabbed my arm and shoved me towards the woods. My parents always told me to never cause a scene and so I didn’t. I knew what was going to happen, I knew my innocence was no longer going to be mine anymore, I knew I could no longer look at myself and hold myself highly. I started crying and i begged him to not do it but he turned around pushed me against the tree and proceeded to unzip by pants. I cried the entire time, I felt my innocence leave my body, I felt my worth slip away and yet I said absolutely nothing. I can’t even tell you how long it lasted for because all I remember was telling myself I needed to stay quiet. He finished and told me that if I was to say anything I wouldn’t be anything anymore. So I walked home crying with blood running down my pants. When I got home my orients weren’t there so I went into the bathroom and took a shower to wipe away the disgusting feeling I had throughout my body. Ive held it in this whole time, nobody knows. I just can’t believe the one place and person that was supposed to be my escape tuned out to be my worst nightmare.I still can’t look at myself i’m the mirror without hating myself.",,
"I was 17 and a guy in my year sent me a series of messages with his friends about what they wanted to do to me sexually - one message was about wanting to rape me. I went to the school suspended the boy responsible for the messages for one week and stated that he would not be allowed to be a prefect, but a year later he became one. I brought it up with the headmaster at the time who implied heavily that the boy was allowed this despite his behaviour because he had been at the school since Year 7 (I arrived in sixth form). Spent the rest of my time there seeing friends of mine be matey with him, sharing a classroom, and denying that his actions had any effect on me. Also saw close friends of mine be treated similarly by other boys in our year, oftentimes it was blatantly racially motivated. The guy and I got into the same university and I spent another three years trying to avoid him while having new friends associate with him (despite knowing about how he treated me). Every time I hear about similar cases or come across him it takes me back to being a scared, humiliated child. Forever changed by the revelation of how misogynistic men are behind closed doors, and by how little people care about girls being subjected to this kind of sexual bullying.",,
"when i was around 12/13, i had just started secondary school. i was walking through the halls when i passed a group of year 10s. one of the boys pinched my bum, and laughed to his mates about. i looked to the only girl in the group and she said “don’t get too excited, they do this all the time”. i’m 16 and leaving school, but i still get panicky if i’m passing a group of people",,
"At a party in sixth form, my best guy friend at the time and a boy I knew less well isolated me from the group and pressured me into kissing the boy I wasn't as close with. I said no at least five times, as I had a boyfriend at the time, but the boy who I was less familiar with had been handing me alcohol all evening and kept insisting, cornering me and touching me in ways that made me uncomfortable. I briefly pecked him on the lips so that he would leave me alone, at which point he put his arms on either side of me and refused to let me leave until I kissed him again. I said no a further three times, finally having to physically push him away so I could run inside.,I remained close with my guy friend after this, as most people (my boyfriend included) placed the blame on me for this incident – so I didn't initially think he had done anything wrong. At university, this guy friend called me up to tell me he was working on a short story in his free time based on the events of our sixth form (the characters/setting was exactly the same, only everyone had pseudonyms). He said that one of the chapters was going be about that party, but in this version the character based on the other boy was going to successfully sexually assault my character. I told him I wasn't comfortable with him writing short stories about me being sexually assaulted, at which point he became defensive and refused to apologise, insisting he would write about it in a 'respectful way'. I stopped all contact with him after this, but he continued to try and message me as though nothing had happened.,I have had multiple other experiences with sexual harassment/assault, many of which my guy friend was aware of as they took place throughout the time I knew him. I don't know if he followed through with his plan and wrote the short story, but the thought of it existing somewhere was extremely triggering for me – causing me to have flashbacks and panic attacks on an almost daily basis.",,

During my afternoon, the woman left to run an errand, leaving me outside with her husband indoors. He came out and told me he needed me to come in for a chat, he told me his wife wanted him to talk to me about horse safety as I’d supposedly forgotten. He told me that as punishment he’d spank me. When I said no he then said that as a child his fear when being punished was the lead up to the punishment so he wanted to pull my trousers down, bend me over his lap and then raise his hand but not actually hit me. When I managed to convince him not to and to instead call my mum and tell her I was ill, he then made me promise not to say a thing to anyone. When I was outside waiting for my mum he came over and started brushing my bum with his fingers, I moved away and he followed and then started tapping his fingers across my bum, I moved away again and then my mum arrived. He was a UK magistrate court judge.",,

I am a current student at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and am sickeningly you might think unsurprised at the amount of [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] cases that have been mentioned here as it is clear that there is and is from the start of the school a problem with the culture. It’s not just [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but it is a great example of an all boys highly academic private school where boys are taught sex education a lot but in general it goes in one ear and out the other because there if not a rape culture is definitely an atmosphere of superiority and general misogyny at the school but mainly in my experience in the younger years before 6th form when boys haven’t matured enough to know it’s completely wrong. It’s a massive problem from yesr 9 and 10 but by year 12/13 in my opinion it’s been mostly grown out of so i’d really like to suggest it’s something that is ingrained into students younger than it is generally at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity],,

"When I was around 12 years old my uncle asked my mum if I could go to his house to help him with his garden so I could earn some extra pocket money. Once there I was taken to his bedroom where he showed me where he kept his money, he asked me to lay on the bed with him and have a “cuddle” as he was lonely due to a recent divorce. I was petrified and frozen in place. I told my mum about what had happened, she wasn’t happy about the situation but nothing was ever done.",,
"I went out for my birthday with my best friend (male) and got very drunk. I got myself home and in bed and he turned up and asked to stay. I thought nothing of it and let him stay in my room, I was very drunk and just wanted to sleep. I woke up to him having taken off my clothes, his hands all over me and attempting to rape me. I was paralysed by fear and alcohol, but I eventually pushed him off me. I had exams the following week where I had to sit close to him and try to focus on my exams instead. I told his girlfriend what had happened and of course he claimed it was consensual. I don’t trust anyone now, if you can’t trust your best mates then who can you trust?",,
"As a teacher I am regularly threatened with sexual violence and rape by a student. When I complained and suggested I will soon refuse to work with the student, I was told this would mean compulsory re-training for me and that I needed to learn to be more emotionally resilient. I am an experienced teacher, I have no issues with my classes and have dealt with all sorts of challenging situations with great resilience and calmness. I don't know what to do when I am told that I just need to put up with rape threats as part of my job. I was told to 'just ignore it' and the student will stop. I have tried this and it does not stop the threats. How can you ever train someone to be OK with threats of rape and sexual violence?",,
"When I was about 17, I began talking to guys on tinder because I had 0 self esteem and no guys were interested in me. So I had and still maintain a rough one month of talking before I meet up with anyone. This one day I was on my way home from work in Wimbledon and I had been talking to a guy from there for a while so I decided to meet up with him. He had his dog so we went for a walk in the park, when I met him I wasnt attracted to him at all, but we walked and talked. Eventually we got to an open space field with like a shed in it? We went behind it and talked and before long he forced my hand down his pants and violently shoved his tounge down my throat. At the time I was like hey a guy likes me but I knew it felt wrong. Looking back I now realise just how wrong it was. And the worst part is the poor dog was there like wtf",,
"I was too drunk and needed taking home, so a friend offered to walk me back to my room. When we got there, he locked my bedroom door with both of us inside. We had sex, which I don’t remember. When my flatmates got back, they found me crying in a blanket on the floor, covered in bruises. In the morning, a female friend approached me and said that she was sorry but also glad, because a similar thing had happened to her with the same boy. She said that I might actually be able to do something about it because I was stronger than her. Because I was so drunk at the time it happened, his friends said I was lying about what happened and that I just regretted sleeping with him. When a male friend of mine took the boy aside to tell him that he had raped me, he replied ‘I know’.",,
Ex boyfriend I had a long distance relationship with would always talk about sex and repeatedly asked for nudes even though I always said no. The situation made me very uncomfortable as this happens for all of the 1.5 years that we were dating and I never realised that this was sexual harassment. I was 12/13 at the time and he was 14/15.,,
"In year 8, a boy in my class asked what my bra size was. After a full week of harassment and me refusing to tell him my bra size, he lost it while we were sitting next to each other in class and I refused again. He reached across, grabbed my breast hard and didn't let go until I wrestled his hand off me. In pain and mortally embarrassed, I instinctively looked around to see who had seen while nervous laughing. This haunts me years later, I have always regretted not reporting him and preventing this happening to another girl.",,
"I was in middle school and a high schooler sent me his nudes then begged for me to send so I did because I liked him and now we go to the same school and he said if I tell anyone he would send them to everyone. I was 13 at the time and he was turning 15. I’ve blocked him on everything. I’m turning 15 soon and i’m still scared that one day he’s going to text me on a platform and threaten me. He has already tried to and I told him if he spreads them I will press charges, i’m scared that if he does spread them i’m not going to have the guts to talk to the police about it.",,
"every day i would go to school, scared of boys, after minding my own business and having multiple boys grab my bum and sexually assault me in many ways. i know i’m not the only person it has happened to. it was reported to the school but they didn’t punish the students, it’s so unfair not feeling comfortable in an environment where you should be safe",,
"I was at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in the [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], there was a notorious teacher called [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who taught maths and ran the [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], everyone knew he had a liking for small boys, I remember him giving me the slipper ( beating me with a gym shoe, an OK form of punishment at that time) in an empty classroom, then insisting I took my trousers and pants down so he could see the red marks he had produced. I can still see this all very clearly, it really stuck in my mind.",,
"Made me upset today to see my abuser repost on his story “dm me if i’m friends with your abuser and that will change” like you are the abuser!!! He is one of many guys who still thinks he has done nothing wrong, despite many sexual harassment stories i could say about him, and non consensual encounters. am seeing far too many boys blindly repost things on their story without considering the damage they might have done, but choosing to remain exempt from it. If anything it’s more invalidating to the victims.",,
Boys used to tell us that if they couldn’t get a boner it was because we weren’t attractive enough. This was something I fully believed for years and it wasn’t until university that I was told how ridiculous it was. They thought it was better to let us feel the humiliation for them not being able to get it up rather than deal with the embarrassment themselves.,,
"This is more just my experience after i experienced sexual assault. I am getting so frustrated with the amount of people worrying about my rapists life after he raped me. Like people keep coming to me being like its not fair that he is hurting like that after being cut off from his friend group, like excuse me. He put that pain on himself. People are more concerned about his life after the assault then how i am doing after he ruined my life. Society needs to change",,
"I’m not really much a girly girl so in school I hang around in groups of boys. In my second year of high school one of the boys in the friend group liked me, I didn’t like him back and I made him aware of that, I said it to his face. He wouldn’t take that as an answer though, this is when he started touching me, I would grab me tight and to touch me inappropriately, if I tried to move he would kick me. I’d go home with my legs covered in bruises. Every other boy in the group thought that this was funny, they laughed and made a joke about it. All of this went on for about 3 years and has now stopped because I moved school. I’m still friends with some of the boys from the group and they all joke about it, they also pretend to grab me the way that he did to laugh at my reaction to it (I jump a little). Thing is so many teachers saw this happen and none of them did anything to help! I told my mum at the time and she said “boys will be boys” however recently I was cat called and told her and she said it shouldn’t have upset me as much as it did then I told her again all the things that he has don’t to me and she said “you should’ve told me sooner”. I don’t get it people don’t care when it happens but they do after? The teacher saw it happening and didn’t care and I think about that a lot, they cared so little about me, one of their pupils, that they would let that happen because the school is that useless.",,
"When I was in freshers week we went to this warehouse club in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] with over 200 people. I had bought a couple of drinks and felt fine but suddenly I was blackout and vomiting and was taken away by a ‘medic’ from the medical tent. I don’t remember anything for four hours except for someone saying to me “if You don’t cooperate I’m gonna cut your tits off” etc. I came to consciousness in the car park shaking and apparently saying “don’t let him touch me again” over and over whilst twitching my head behind me every two minutes. Although I was a mess and didn’t even know if I had been assaulted or not, the uni were so helpful. Someone from the SU drove me back to the student hub in halls and sat with me for ages. They booked me in at the sexual health clinic the next morning and I got so many tests done and the nurses were lovely. Posting this as want to remind people even if they’re drugged up and have no real evidence, there are always places you can go. I felt so guilty for making people look after me cos I don’t know if I was raped or not but the important thing is is that if someone makes you feel uncomfortable there are great support networks for you. Also clubs really need to get a handle on spiking as it affects so many women every time and can ruin experiences of going out forever. I still get panic attacks sometimes when I’m drunk even thought there are no real memories I can cling on to. Stay safe out there and remember to appreciate the death of Sarah as a tragedy in itself xxx",,
i went out with my friends and some guys they had thought it was fun to drink and to smoke they offered me and shot i politely declined but still kept on asking they were mostly intoxicated by the substances but i wasn’t they kept on offering i said no and then i felt peer pressured to take it since they were all getting mad and saying mean things they wanted to go for a walk but i chose to stay by the fire with a guy they left and he started with small talk but still drunk and slurred words i was trying to sober him up but it wasn’t working that’s when he came over and put his head on my lap to lay down with his hands near him i didn’t think anything of it because it was a common sleeping position until he started rubbing his hand up and down my thigh and i moved his hand but he harshly put it back he got up started kissing me and i pushed him off but even if i did he only came back stronger .... i said no and kept on trying but he still insisted and took my clothes off i tried to get out of the grip but he was too strong and i couldn’t even if i tried to fight back and that’s when i knew what was going to happen and it did after it was done i picked up my clothes and ran down the street and cried knowing what just happened i felt disgusting and dirty after a while i walked back and the other kids were entering as well they wanted to go home and i didn’t have a ride but then so i had to the next day so many people were texting me about it calling me a slut a whore etc i was confused but knew who it was i confronted him asking why all he said was because i can i said you are the one the forced me he goes i didn’t force you anything you were moaning and you liked it but i’ve never moaned for i was crying the whole time at this point we were in the halls screaming at each-other with everyone staring i felt so ashamed but he was popular and people would have believed him more i lost my friends for lying and even some teachers had said they were disgusting and dissatisfied and disappointed for me lying but i wasn’t i dated quite and went on with the shaming knowing there was nothing i could have done,,
"I was forcibly fingered while really drunk by a boy who dragged me away from my friends and behind bushes where nobody could see. He then texted me the next morning begging me not to tell anyone about it because he knew what he did was wrong. At the time I didn’t tell people because I felt embarrassed. The prevalence of things like this is scary, consent doesn’t seem necessary to some people.",,
"I had a little voice then, but I don’t anymore. He was weird. He tried to dry hump me on the sofa at work. He told me he loved me. I hate him. He tried to make me jealous years later when he got poor unsuspecting her to call me and ask me for his number. Do you think I was stupid? I knew what he was trying to do. Now he’s weird and sad and old. I’m still young and happy and beautiful. I never have to have him near me again. I wriggled free and escaped his weirdness. I found the kindest most loving man when I learnt to break free from his clutches. I am free from his cruel psychological torture. She is stuck with him. She should try to break free as well. A message to the bosses; don’t leave the sweet kind girls alone with the older predators in the office late at night. They’re the wolves and we’re the lambs. You knew what he was like and you left me to his abuse. Shame on you. You know who I’m talking about, you know who he is. He’s not a star.",,
"i was sexually assaulted by a guy i knew at a party when i was 14. i was too drunk to be able to push him off me, when i asked two guy friends for help they laughed at me thinking it was a joke. the next week in school i was so embarrassed that i pretended nothing had happened. i still think about it so much",,
"From my first year at secondary school aged eleven, a boy at my school would corner me and put his hand up my skirt and touch me intimately all over. Sometimes this would happen several times a day and although it started when I was on my own, he progressed to doing it in front of other pupils. In my second year at secondary school, a woman talked to the school in assembly about telling a nominated female teacher if someone made unwanted advances. Later that day, this boy cornered me in the playground and afterwards I went up to the nominated teacher and told her whet he had just done and how long he had been doing it. She told me not to be silly and make things up and as I walked away, I heard her tell another teacher that I had approached her and laughed about what I said. This boy continued to do this for several years afterwards. He did this to a lesser extent to my friend whenever she was with me and I now know from bumping into an old school friend a few years ago that he did the same thing to her throughout school and although she also told a teacher, nothing was done. I’m not sure how many others he did this to but he left school without ever facing any consequences.",,
"A very close male friend of mine abused my trust and took advantage of me when drunk after I repeatedly said no and even told him I liked someone else. He called me an Uber then got in and got out at the other end with me. He forced himself on me after I repeatedly said no and removed his hands from inside of me. He kept trying to finger me and I kept removing his hand even though I was passing out due to alcohol and exhaustion - the last thing I remember he had his fingers inside of me. I told his friends, who were also mine as we were in the same friendship group, and they are all still very close friends.",,
When I was in year 9 I was walking through a crowded corridor between lessons and a boy groped my boobs as he walked past me. I was so embarrassed and ashamed and spent the rest of my time at school scared that he was going to tell everyone. Then in year 11 I got a boyfriend and he pressured me into letting him do things to me that I wasn’t comfortable with and if I said no he’d make me feel guilty until I let him. I didn’t realise that this was a form of sexual assault until 2 years later.,,
"When I was 14/15 I had a friend. This friend was clearly developing sexual urges, as kids do at that age. But they would never keep it to themselves. They'd often grope me and other people both behind closed doors or even in public. But they went even further with me. They'd often sleep over at my house and I'd sleep over at theirs, at several sleepovers we had they assaulted me. I'd fallen asleep before them and they decided to grope me, I knew that it was happening but I was too scared to move or do anything.",,
"I was sexually harassed by a girl in primary school. She had an obsession with me. She was an Asian girl who was very confused and her culture did not help circumstances. I am also an Asian girl with a better support system like my parents than she had. We use to be friends when we were in reception, year 1 and 2. But in year 3 she started to act weirdly, she would try and grab my hand. Once she was very aggressive and I bit her arm. There were little things like she would try to place her water bottle next to me and even use my water bottle. She would wait for me to leave sometimes try and stand next to me at the bottle station. If there was a few people in the class room she would try to chase me and pin me down. Everyone knew what she was doing and was scared of her as she was a bigger size. The teachers were little help over the years. Eventually in year 6 I think they moved her to a different school temporarily. As we went into year 5 and 6 things got worse even though school knew. Once in year 6 when she came back, a teacher had to stay with her throughout the day. Once at the end of the day we had to go to the cloakroom to get our coats and the teacher wasent with her. She backed me into a corner and pinned me to the wall, she tried to lean into me and I had to scream for help and I everyone ran out and I was so embarrassed. My parents threatened to call the police multiple times but we never did. The girl went on to harass girls in her secondary school. She tried to play the victim many times and acted as if she didn’t know what she was doing. I can vaguely remember her trying to touch my private’s multiple times but being to embarrassed to tell that to anyone till this day. Even people in school didn’t help they would still play with regardless of knowing what she did to me. I still think about what happened as it lasted over a period of seven years consistently, she ruined my childhood.",,
"It was [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. My freshman year of high school just ended and I was enjoying the summer. My mother and sister went to the beach and I went to my closest guy friend’s home. We went up to his room and he had shut the door. I thought nothing of it. He taught me how to play fortnite and we cuddled a bit. I ended up falling asleep for a small nap and I woke up to him rubbing me down below. I pretended to stay asleep out of fear, but then he put his fingers inside- it hurt. I’ve never been touched down there before so it really hurt me. After a few minutes I told him to get off. He thought it was because it felt too good, but it was because I never wanted it in the first place.. but now he is a highschool drop out with parents who dislike him and an addiction to video games and no future ahead of him.. but that doesn’t change much",,
"I moved to boarding school when I was 16 and I started dating this 18 year old guy in the year above. Things started off ok, but then he started acting really sexual towards me even when I said I wanted to take things slow. This started off with asking me for photos and sending photos and videos of himself that were unconsentual. One evening he took me to the park and I told him I just wanted to kiss but he pressured me into giving him a handjob and then painfully fingered me up against a tree, it was horrible. This kept happening and one evening he forced me to give him a blowjob even though I said I didn’t want to. A month later, he took my virginity in a school bathroom at night, I told him I didn’t want to but he told me I had to relax and that I was fine, so I listened to him. He didn’t use protection the first time and left me bleeding and hurt. I was scared, I had no one to turn to and I felt alone and broken. I felt like I could never report it as he was my ‘boyfriend’ and I felt like I was SUPPOSED to have sex with him but I realised soon after what he was doing to me was NOT ok. I moved away from the school soon after and told my parents/ close friends.",,
"I made friends with this person just over a year ago. We became close really fast during lockdown and they would make jokes about how I should die and I thought nothing of it and refused to because they were more only friend at the time. The things they said started getting worse and turned into joking about raping me and breaking into my house. They started to grab my ass when I gave them a hug which made me incredibly uncomfortable but I was too scared to say anything. A couple weeks later, we were stood in the toilets at school together, surrounded by people, I was stood in front of them and they looked down and put their hand by my 'area', I stepped back but laughed it off because I was scared that if I said something then we wouldn't be friends anymore. They did it multiple times on that day and different days after that. I guess it was my fault for not telling them not to but it was clear I was uncomfortable. We aren't friends anymore and thinking back on it makes me feel sick.",,
"Woke up with a boy in the top year in my bed with his hands down my trousers. Pretended like I didn’t realise. For months didn’t say anything but when I built up the courage to tell someone the school shut it down, the headmaster felt no sympathy except for the older guy who was in my bed. The way the schooled handled makes me think that telling someone was the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life it’s ruined my life, my mental health and destroyed me leading to depression. I was 15 when it happened",,
"So I can't fully remember the specifics because I was going through a tough time mentally. Several years ago, there was an older man working in the warehouse of the store who was intimidating, racist and a misogynist. I worked there for about 3 months and pretty much from day one his verbal harassment began. I quit due to how the manager (a female) treated staff so poorly which ultimately affected my mental health. I didn't feel safe to report his inappropriate comments and I also didn't have the courage I have now to call it out. But I did call out his racism to another member of staff (also female) who then asked me about my comments to her in front of him! Looking back now, I can see a total lack of women supporting women in that store, which was probably due to the female managers terrible attitude and approach, and/or the male area managers attitude towards women.",,
"When I was 14, I was at a party with all my friends. I was drunk and a boy came up to me and started trying to kiss me, after I said no many times he started kissing down my neck. He kept wanting more from me despite me saying I didn't want anything to do with him, leading to him slipping his hand up my dress and fingering me without my consent.",,
"I was in 6th grade and he was my ""friend"" he would force me to do things with him even though I expressed how uncomfortable I was. I did the things and let him touch me because I didn't want him to un friend me. I was a huge people pleasure back then I wish I wasn't",,
"I was having sex with a guy who I had slept with before, so thought I trusted him so much. It began to hurt so much so I told him to stop and that I was in pain. He put his hand over my mouth and kept going. I had tears in my eyes from the pain.",,
I was 14 and was in the safety of my own house I was having a party and got very drunk I was talking to a boy who came across so nice and was helping me he helped me with the empty bottles and took my drink off me and told me to meet him upstairs to get it back I walked into the bedroom and was pushed on the bed and held down while he pulled my skirt up and I was so scared I couldn’t even move or try and help myself I just froze and lay there it was when my friend who is know my hero walked in and pulled him off me it’s now 2 years later and I can only know talk about it after long nights of nightmares and ptsd I can now accept that it happened and try and move on,,
when i was 8 sadly i was harassed by a family friend,,
"It was dark, sitting around a bonfire on the beach in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and a boy sitting next to me slowly started to slip his hand up my skirt and into my knickers. There were lots of people and I was too anxious to get up straight away but when I did he just shrugged at me and said, ‘what did you expect?’.",,
I was pushed to the floor and humped I went to tell a teacher/lunch time assistant and she said 'boys will be boys',,
"It was my first time having sex. for months i didn’t even realise i had been sexually assaulted because i was coerced into having sex and coerced into thinking i wanted it. i would slightly push him off me and say ‘wait’ and he still tells me i consented. he told me because i was smiling i wanted it. he put his dick in me, i pushed him off me and he then said “you’re not a virgin anymore” which made me uncomfortable, later on he then had sex with me after he’d convinced me more. he gaslighted me saying i wanted it which made the healing process so much harder knowing he’s completely fine while i’m broken. i’m terrified he’ll do something to me again. i was scared of him before he raped me.",,
"When I was around 14 I was at a party quite drunk and started gw this boy. He leads me into the toilet and locks the door. My friends see what is happening and start banging on the door pleading him to let me out. I move to unlock the door and he puts his back against it, blocking my exit. He proceeds to ask me to give him head. I refuse and back away - at this point he pulls out a condom and starts to masturbate into it. Once he finishes, he unlocks the door and takes the used condom with him. He flashes it around the party and tells everyone we had sex when we had not... if my friends hadn’t pressurised him into letting me out who knows what would have happened. Thankful for them to this day",,
"Girls I know are groped on a daily basis. For me, the first time was when I was in year 8. Me and my friends were lying in a park when a boy from school came over and grabbed my tits, and began to say you like that, don’t you? The second time it was like same boy picking me up and squeezing my ass, and then again smacking my ass with racquet’s during PE. This boy has been reported to the school on many occasions yet nothing has ever been done. When I was 13, it was my grandad. He was slightly tipsy and began grabbing my ass at a family event. A girl I know was raped at my school, and when she came forward, all that was done was her being moved down in classes so she wouldn’t be near him. No police informed, no punishment.",,
Lost my virginity to rape. He told me and his friends I was ugly and a slut who would let him do anything to her. He convinced me this was normal and continued to have sex with me at least 20+ times in the coming months which I kept saying no to or was crying through but I thought it was something I just had to accept.,,
"I was black out drunk at a party and I ended up following a boy into the woods. He was all over me abs at first it was just joking around and then he started to take my clothes off. I started to say no in a jokey way but then I actually started being serious. Of course coz I was drunk I was falling all over the place and didn’t have that much strength. He completely ignored me and started taking off my clothes. My vision was blurred and it was like I had no control over what was happening. He started doing stuff to me amd I kept saying no but he kept going. That was the night I lost my virginity, being held down in the woods by an older boy who just left me there after like I was a peice of meat.",,
"When I was two weeks into being fifteen an older family friend took me to a [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] party. It was my first proper party and I was very excited. I drank and laughed and had a great time and even got with a guy I really fancied- he was 18 but I consented and we just kissed. One of his 18 year old friends who had been bugging me all night and kept bringing me drinks pulled me off to talk to him. I cant remember how but we ended up sitting on the grass kissing in front of everyone. Lots of his friends (boys and girls) laughingly shouted at us “mate shes fifteen” and “pedo” (none of them attempted to intervene though) so he was fully aware of my age. He asked if we could go upstairs or somewhere private so we could “go further”. I didnt want to go any further as I was a virgin and wasnt ready to do anything bar kissing- and I told him that. He told me it was fine and he didnt mind and kept kissing me. Moments later his hand was up my skirt and I stopped kissing him. He told me everything was fine and I said he could keep his hand there as long as he didnt go underneath my tights because i didnt want to cause a scene. Moments later again his hand was under my tights and underwear and he was trying to finger me. At this point I explicitly said no i didnt want to i wasnt ready multiple times. He carried on and because I was young and naive and drunk I thought I just had to let him do it. I thought i should go along with it and even a few minutes in pretended to moan a little bit. It hurt alot. Even now I cant let my loving and amazing boyfriend of three years finger me as I feel so afraid. I felt really ashamed and like I was “a slut” (something I was bullied for at school for dating three guys in the space of a year even though only ever actually kissed one of them). A girl I looked up to who was 18 took a photo of us kissing on the grass and sent it to me because she thought it was funny. I dont think she knew about fingering. The worst bit now to think about is the fact that that was the first sexual experience I had and it was nonconsensual, on wet grass, in front of loads of strangers all watching and laughing and i didnt even the fancy the boy in the first place.",,
"Although I have a number of stories to offer, I unfortunately don’t have the courage to share them yet - even if a few are already known.,However, what I will say is that I truly believe the issues I now have surrounding sex are the result of my experiences whilst in the ‘[name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] private school bubble’. Where for many years I did not feel I had ownership over my own body.,The scary thing is that I am clearly not alone. That it is only now (4 years after leaving school) that I am realising the extent of what I endured and how truly wrong it was.,I think boys, and girls, need to be more aware of the emotional trauma that their actions and words can have. I did not choose to be a ‘slut’ but I now carry that shame with me everyday and within every relationship. After nearly seven years, I still find it hard to enjoy sex, and now struggle accepting physical affection from males. I can’t even watch sex scenes on TV without cringing. Such trauma is not as easily healed and it can leave lasting scares.",,
when I was 16 I was taking the train home on a friday after finishing work and it was kinda late as it had been delayed. at one of the stops a guy i knew as he was friends with someone’s older brother who was like 19/20 got on and he was drunk and he told me he had just been to the Royal Ascot races. he started to kiss me and groping my breasts. I won’t go into detail but there was a pencil in the pocket of my bag and i tried to stab him with it but he knocked it onto the floor and it ended in me being held down over the train seat and raping me. I remember him saying how it felt ‘so good’ because i was ‘so tight’. I think I would have gotten pregnant if he had finished but the pencil rolled past me so I grabbed it and stabbed him without looking and then ran. my gf at the time encouraged me to report it to police so the next monday i went and did and said how he had left a hand shaped bruise on my breast. the police man asked to see it so i pulled down my top a bit to show him the top of the bruise that wasn’t really on my breast. he then told me to just show him the whole bruise and moved forward to move my bra to see it completely. because i didn’t show him the whole bruise and i said i was in a relationship he said there wasn’t enough evidence as the top of the bruise (which was like one of the fingers) could have been a hickey. so i left and haven’t told anyone else about it. the only person who knows was my gf at the time but i told her i had told my parents even though i hadn’t.,,
"At the age of 8, I was groomed online and harassed by a number of men who threatened me in order to gain pictures of my 8 year old body. I was tortured by them and threatened with death, kidnapping..they told me my parents wouldn’t love me after what I had done. But I hadn’t done anything. It wasn’t until years later that I realised what happened to me. We are all so strong.",,
I always avoided the latymers when I was at school because they were the worst even if you didn’t know them they would get your number and start harassing you. These guys wouldn’t leave me alone and would brag about how they got a girl from his school to finger his butt so that he could tell everyone in the year about it as if it was like a cool thing to do.,,
"Last year I was assaulted by one of my previously good friends after I had woken up from being passed out for several hours at a party. He tried twice before giving up whilst I laid there frozen from being so scared. A few weeks later he messaged me to ‘apologise’, in which he blamed me for leading him on and that he was angry at me for “trying to make him feel worse than he already be did” as if I was in the wrong. I never felt I could speak up because of his ‘social status’ and for fears of being called a liar. I haven’t felt comfortable at school since and have felt overwhelming guilt and responsibility for the situation because I blamed myself for causing it. I’ve doubted it even happened or if what happened was assault, but I know that what happened wasnt consensual and made me so scared so it must have been.",,
There was once a £20 bet on whether I would lose my virginity to this one boy at a party. A lot of my friends were involved and they told me it was just a joke. I guess I didn’t register how fucked up this was until I started thinking about it all.,,
I was sexually assaulted by my ex that would cheat on me then guilt trip me into wanting to be “just friends” then he would sit by me on the bus and touch and rub my thigh and i would just sit there frozen not know what to do. That happened when i was in 6th grade but ive moved schools in the middle of my 7th year.,,
"My now ex and I were out one day after college, we were a very new couple at the time and we were chilling at a park near my house and having a nice time then he said “Let’s play the fire truck game”. I wasn’t familiar with this game at all and was just happy to be spending time with him so I was just like “Okay”. He then put his hand on my knee and said “Tell me when you want me to stop” and then his hand got up my thigh towards my private area and I said “Stop” and he said “Firetrucks don’t stop at red lights” and then proceeded to touch me there. He lingered there but I shoved his hand off. He laughed hard about it and I just laughed even though I knew it was wrong and I was uncomfortable but I was so in love with him that I brushed it off really quickly. We were 16/17. And I only now realise how disgusting it was. I’m 20 now.",,
"Recently I had a guy over for a casual night of sex, it was our second time meeting up. I made it clear whilst we were sober that I wanted to use protection. I stated this position at least three times in total, as he tried to negotiate with me. We had sex protected, then ran out of my condoms. Fooling around again, I asked if he had condoms, he said yes but was reluctant to get them. Eventually he just went inside me unprotected, despite at the last minute saying he wouldn’t. As soon as he penetrated me I froze. I was screaming in my head for him to stop but I couldn’t produce the words. I just let it happen to me and waited for it to be over. I felt pressured - maybe it had gone too far to make a fuss? I had to remind him not to cum inside me at the end.,Not only did he fail to get consent to enter me unprotected, he chose to ignore my boundary that I had explicitly stated. It was like my insistence to use condoms had just been a bit of foreplay for him. To him my ‘no’ had meant ‘convince me’. Really I had accepted on a level that my boundary and feelings were secondary to his pleasure.,Maybe he was waiting for me to say no for the 4th time, and re-affirm my boundary after being pushed - but that’s coercion. I wanted to share this, almost to remind myself, that just because you consent to casual sex doesn’t mean that person has your consent to do anything they want with your body. He went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] so I guess that’s relevant. This kind of behaviour doesn’t end at school."",He then proceeded to get on top of me. I asked him to stop- he didn’t.,I didn’t fight. This is the part I carry. The feeling of ‘you should’ve fought’ never leaves me",,
He hurt me and stared.. it was so hard to hide the amount of damage that was done but I almost gave up. I didn’t though amd im proud to say that.,,
"I had been coerced into doing things I didn’t want to do, even in public, and into sending nudes of myself which I wasn’t comfortable with doing, but I did it because it was normalised that you had to do that as a girl for a boy to like you. I was once shown my own nudes on a boy’s phone, who I had been friends with since year 7 and had never sent nudes to. After some rumours were spun about me, I was laughed at, made to cry in lessons, had boys shout at me for being a slut at parties to the point where I had to leave. I have also been groped by several guys, and when I told people that a boy had groped me, I was told that nothing really happened, and that I shouldn’t go round ruining peoples reputations. There are also some other experiences I don’t want to share in fear of this being linked to me, because of how widespread parts of the stories were when they happened. As I don’t go there anymore, I just want to highlight what a problem they have with rape culture, and I know my stories aren’t even near the bad ones.",,
"I went to a friends house party one weekend and got really drunk. I ended up being sick and putting myself to bed at around 9/10pm. There was a guy who was flirting with me all evening, who I wasn't attracted to at all, but I had very low self-esteem so I kind of just allowed it. After putting myself to bed in a very drunken state, he came into the room, took my pants off and went down on me for about 20 minutes. I felt violently uncomfortable but didn't know how to tell him to stop so I told him to just 'put it in' to get it over with. We had sex twice that night and I didn't want to either time. The next morning all my 'friends' knew about it and when I expressed that I never actually wanted to have sex with him, I was ignored for the rest of the day. We all went back to our boarding house that evening and by the next morning it was public knowledge. Not a single person asked me if I was okay, or for my side of the story. I had people coming into my dorm room to yell at me for having no respect for myself, for rushing into sex and for being a bad friend to the host of the party. I was so distraught and am still so upset that every single person took the boys side and supported him. This was about 4 years ago now and I still think about it from time to time.",,
"This happened about 18 years ago. I was 17. At a house party. The guy was meant to be my friend. We went upstairs and we were kissing. He then tried to have sex with me. I must have told him countless times that I didn't want to have sex. In the end, I had to use all my strength to push him off. When I told friends, they just made excuses for him. I had to face him everyday in school after that.",,
"I was sitting in class and he started touching me and it made me uncomfortable so I went to tell him to stop and I froze. I felt helpless and I couldn't even look him in the eyes and then after over a year of not being friends I thought maybe I overreacted by trying to avoid him and that it was my fault, so we hung out and I realized it was a mistake because there was nothing I could to to stop him that time and no one around to help.",,
"I was forced into having sex at the age of 16. It was my first time and I had made it clear that I didn’t want to in all ways you can think of and he still went ahead, actually enjoying it. He wouldn’t let me leave after and kept getting angry at me, threatening me with physical violence if I didn’t stay the night. So I stayed, spent the entire night flinching around him and crying and he was just making fun of me. I’m turning 19 now and still get flash backs and anxiety from it",,
He only wanted nudes,,
"It happened during my sophomore year. We were at the back of the school, near the end of the soccer field. A friend had mentioned how they had always pictured a close friend of mine and I together earlier that day. He said that to the both of us, and we immediately dismissed and denied the idea. At least I truthfully did… Later that day, we had been alone by the resaca, and just talking like we normally did. Eventually, he took my hand and naive me expected a gentleman character out of him. I was wrong. He brought my hand to his area and told me that I made him that way and that I should take care of it. And he made me. He was persistent, even though he knew how uncomfortable I was. He was rough, even though he knew how gentle I was. He was betraying, even though he knew how hard it was for me to trust anyone alone. He didn’t just take advantage of me… he took my light away. He took everything from me.",,
"Very mild compared to other stories and not about SA or r#pe but my for as long as I can remember my dad who is also emotionally abusive to the entire family and a narcissist has constantly harassed other women when they don’t have the opportunity to resist I.e: waitresses, maids, women alone in elevators etc. He touches them a lot around the waist sometimes to pull them closer or grabs them by the arms even when they’re clearly uncomfortable. He also makes comments about their weight and appearance which he never does to men. On several occasions he referred to victims of statutory r#pe like Epstein and R Kelly survivors as prostitutes and said women should feel flattered when powerful men like Trump feel them up and probably want to be touched anyway. Also that harassment is bullshit women make up for attention which is even worse considering my mum is a survivor. He also told us a “funny story” about repeatedly pushing a maid onto the bed in his hotel room cause it was “funny” to him how her skirt flew up and she was blushing. All my comments go ignored or provoke him yelling at me demanding respect and saying “I’ll do whatever I like” or just laughing at me as if I’m stupid. No one has ever reported him which goes to show the extent of how much harassment has been normalized. When I bring up experiencing harassment and that it’s very scary he pretends to get it and then does it all over again to any woman we meet. Up until I was 16 he also kept slapping my butt and commenting on my body saying it looks “curvy” and “succulent” and commenting on how quickly I “developed into a woman” saying I should start horse riding to improve my body further. I’m sure he just still considers me a little girl and doesn’t mean it in a sexual way but it made me uncomfortable so I asked him to stop which he eventually did but not before acting offended and questioning why I thought it was weird.",,
"This is just another example of how messed up some of the normalised actions are that exist at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I remember too vividly in Y8 being asked to line up against a wall in form time and having a male teacher press a credit card on our legs to check skirt length. I genuinely thought this was normal but only after talking to others as well as my parents did I realise how wrong this was. However this wasn't the only thing, also not being allowed to wear legging for sports because they were 'distracting' for male teachers. The environment that specifically the boys at the school are brought up in makes their actions seem fine and make women feel like it was their fault. It also made us think that we should be defined by the opinions of men and that we should take a slap on the arse as a compliment. We have had close to no sexual education other than a talk in y8 that literally said that you need to ask before giving someone a hug - like after that what do you expect.",,
"My second night back at University for my second year pre-season training. I went out with some friends without eating much for dinner. I remember bumping into a guy a couple of years older (from the same sports club as me and my friends) in the queue. He was quite flirty as we’d had a thing the previous year but I didn’t think anything of it. I had quite a lot to drink and don’t remember much of the night, but woke up naked in my bed the next morning. The same guy popped his head through the door and asked if I was ok and said bye, I assumed he’d just stayed on my flatmate floor so I wasn’t concerned about it.,I turned up to training the next day to people laughing at me and making comments. Apparently I’d slept with him the night before which I didn’t remember. I felt awful and blamed myself as I was seeing someone else, I was so embarrassed.,I went back to my flat and my male flat mates were really concerned and asked how I was. Apparently this guy had taken me home after I was kicked out of the club for being too drunk. He had carried me up my stairs to the kitchen where my flatmates met him, had a laugh and said he could go home as they could take it from here. He shouted at them for laughing at me and said he’d ‘look after me himself’, during this conversation I slipped off the kitchen counter as I couldn’t hold myself upright. He then carried me up to the top floor. My next door neighbour heard him having sex with me in the night as he’d left the door slightly ajar carrying me in.,I went into my room and found my underwear, ripped stuffed down the side of my radiator. I really didn’t know how to feel. At the time I reasoned with myself that I’d slept with him before and I was drunk and encouraged it so I shouldn’t let it affect me.,Anyone I spoke to about this incident at the time felt super uncomfortable. In fact, the guy I was seeing got angry with me - I’m not sure if it was because he thought I let it happen, he didn’t believe me that I couldn’t remember it happening or he just didn’t like the idea of me being with another guy. Other people were like ‘that’s harassment’ but I honestly didn’t feel anyone took the incident as seriously as they should have done , and I blamed myself for drinking and blacking out so did not pursue any further action. The guy stayed in the club and people who knew what had happened treated him more or less the same, although he was less involved with socials than he had been the year before.,This incident has affected how much I trust men in general and I struggle to let my guard down. I also feel uncomfortable when people approach me or my friends in clubs and bars and it has 100% made me more aggressive in these situations. I freeze when people touch me without my consent.,I fully believe that the guy who did it does not believe he did anything wrong.",,
"When I was 17 I was sexually assaulted by a guy in my friendship circle (not from my school). In a midst of self-blame for putting myself in the position of going to his house, I tried to forgive the person. I urge every girl, however long ago this may have happened- to come forward, it can affect you long term if you don’t speak to anyone about it properly.",,
had a guy telling me that if i did not sleep with him he would selfharm or kill himself,,
"In the last 2 days I have been catcalled at 6 times, every time by grown men. I am 16. Today, I was walking through one of the main parks in my city and two men (around the age of 60) were sitting on a bench by the path that I was walking along. I saw them staring at me as I went to walk past them. When I did, one of the men began to catcall me. The man beside him laughed along and did nothing to stop him. I felt like I had been reduced from a human being to a toy for them to play with. I didn’t say anything to them out of fear of being assaulted (there was no one else around us), so i kept my head down and kept walking. It made me feel angry. I was angry that I couldn’t tell them where to shove their disgusting comments because I cared too much for my safety. Have respect for women, and if you can’t do that, then at least keep your mouths shut.",,
When I was 16 I went to a house party and I slept with a boy from my sixth form. I told him to wear a condom because I wasn’t on the pill anymore but he took it off half way through without me realising and once I did he said “oh well I’ve done now anyway” (this is all whilst his friends kept coming in the room and taking pictures). I didn’t know this was classed as sexual assault (stealthing?) until recently. It makes me so upset because this boy now shares things on social media about how messed up abortion is and how it’s disgusting yet this boy could have got me pregnant and couldn’t care less.,,
"He was my boyfriend and even though I said no and made it clear I didn't want to/ I was uncomfortable he still pressured me and made me feel bad for saying no until I gave in to avoid him hating me or being upset or us getting into another heavy argument. I used to just sit and stare at his walls.. I could tell you exactly what is in his bedroom, on his shelves, the movies he had under his tv. I had to concentrate on them so many times to keep myself distracted from what's going on until it was over and he was still upset with me for ""looking disappointed"" so it was again somehow my fault. Just because it was a consensual relationship doesn't mean it was always consensual sex.",,
I was called a slut by a group of boys because I was dating some one atm who wanted to have sex whereas I didnt. This continued every lunch and break for around 4 days.,,
"When l was in year 10 a guy would always touch me by my waist. He was the friend of my ex. He would put pressure on my hips and waist and l wouldn’t know what to do. Him and his friends always laughed when they saw me. They also added me to group chats , and calling me stuff.",,
"I have been hit continuously by boys in this school and have been called a slut by the girls . It’s vile behaviour and I want it to stop, I have also been cat-called and sent unwanted pictures",,
"I was 17 and working my first real job when I made “friends” with one of the guys (25) that I worked with. We got along really well as we had similar humour and he was just easy to chat with. He started making sexual comments about how “sexy” I was and I just ignored them and laughed them off as harmless flirting. Then he started to get physical, he worked in the stock room and I worked on the shop floor, I had to go into the stock room whenever I needed anything and he would take advantage of knowing where the cameras were and weren’t. He would drag me to areas he knew weren’t covered and would grab my boobs and slap my bum and try to touch me both over and under my clothes. I would scream and he would cover my mouth with his hand and laugh. I told my boyfriend at the time what was happening and showed him the messages I’d sent begging the guy to stop and to leave me alone (I was too afraid to say anything in person) and my boyfriend told me it was my own fault, that I led him on by being his friend and made him think I liked him. It got to a point where I was too afraid to go into the stock room alone and eventually just left a job that I loved because I would have panic attacks at the sound of his name. I wanted to report him but he told me no one would believe me because he had been there longer and I was just a “little girl begging for attention”.",,
"During the fall of my freshman year i reconnected with a friend from middle school, he quickly became one of my best friends. At first we had a somewhat sexual relationship, i wasn’t in a good place mentally and i was using sex to cope. I broke things off with him and told him i did not have any sexual interest in him however we could still be friends. He agreed and we went back to being platonic friends. A couple days before new years he had come over to watch movies and have a sleepover, i had specifically told him i was not interested in having sex and we would only be watching moving and having a couple of drinks. He agreed. I fell asleep at some point during the night and was waken up by his hands rubbing and groping me. i wasn’t sure if i what i was feeling was actually happening and i tried to go back to sleep, however he kept rubbing me and began to thrust his hips into my back. I completely froze and just sat there waiting for it to stop. I can’t remember if i fell asleep again while waiting for it end or if he stopped and then i fell asleep. all i know is i blamed myself. I thought he was my best friend.",,
"I was out drinking in a field with a friend. There’s a small children’s park fenced off in the middle of it and we were sat on the swings. These three men started to approach the park and when they came in they started talking to us. They gave us more alcohol and also asked me to roll a joint (it was their weed but they didn’t know how to roll) so I did. When I was rolling it I thought the weed was a strange colour and I smoke it often so I know the difference. I rolled it and gave it back to them but they told me to smoke it, I tried to share it with them but they each took one toke and gave it back and didn’t have any more. My friend doesn’t smoke weed so she only had one toke which meant I ended up having most of it. As I was smoking it one of the men kept asking if it felt different to normal but when I asked him to clarify what he meant he wouldn’t. They kept trying to get us to go back to the pub with them but we refused and then they asked for sc names which we gave them. They then left but soon after came back and called me over so I went to see what they wanted while my friend stayed in the park. The man asked for my number and kept insisting even though I was saying no so I ended up giving him a fake one. He was pulling me really close to him and then started kissing me and going underneath my clothes and I didn’t know what to do so I just let it happen and didn’t try to stop him because he was around 30 and I was only 17. He kept trying to pull me away and get me to go back to his but I managed to get out of it by saying I couldn’t leave my friend alone, he said he would call me later and then left. I went to sit back in the park with my friend and explain what happened, after about five minutes she saw them coming back and so we got our stuff and ran over to these boys to ask them to pretend to know us so the men would leave us alone.",,
Someone at my school just stare at the girls when the girls walk pass them or if they see,,

"The boys will run around slapping the girls asses, thinking it’s all fun and jokes. Some girls are okay with it, yet some have said they don’t like it and they will call her a wh*re, then carry on. The teachers will see it or be told about it, yet they’ve not done anything to help it. There’s also been many rape allegations, yet these kids have been to scared to tell the teachers, then blasted by people saying they are lying and just trying to get attention, because they are scared to say who it is.",,
"I was at a party and I was far too drunk, to the point of not remembering anything past midnight. The next day I asked my guy friend what happened and he said he could not remember either. Later that day, my girl friend messaged me saying that he told everyone we had sex. I felt so sick. If it was true, he looked at me and lied to my face and I cannot have been completely conscious. If it was false, I was just another victim of a ‘lad story’. Back at uni, his friends would look at me and go ‘oh that’s her’ whilst he would grope my bum and boobs in public.",,
"it was just a regular friday where you would have to run laps for pe and remind you, i was only in the 6th grade. i was getting ready for pe and you would have to go into the girls locker room to change into your pe clothes and i was the last one there and no one else was in the locker room except me. as i was changing, i saw the the door to go outside from the locker room was open and usually it would be like that but it was to the point where anyone can go in since there were no staff around. i heard footsteps going towards the locker room thinking it was probably just another girl that forgot something but it was an 8th grade boy. i thought he got mixed up and thought it was the boys locker room but he knew it was the girls. he was going through every hall seeing if there was anyone there but he saw me. i asked him why he was there and i was panicking because my shirt was off so i had only pants and a bralette on. he goes toward me slowly and throws me on the floor.",,
"My school has recently admitted to the possibility of banning school skirts due to the fact that the length of them on female students *everyone over the ages of 16+ have now left the school* are distracting and that it is unfair for them to be that length, they have mentioned this in the past, but no female teachers have ever mentioned the fact that skirts are of an inappropriate length nor them being distracting or them being unfair, it has only ever male teachers or male students *though majority of the time it is male teachers making these remarks* the problem I have with this is summer is commencing and male students are aloud to wear shorts, and no female or male would say their distracting, but once a female student is wearing one, it’s distracting and unfair, what I don’t understand is how the length is unfair. if a skirt on a female who is underaged is distracting to a grown man, it is him who is the problem not the student, if a skirt on a female who is underaged is unfair towards the man, it is him who is the problem.",,
"There are two particularly traumatising instances of sexual assault and rape that I have experienced. The first occurred when I was fifteen years old, when two of my friends and I stayed over at our other friend's place. We were smoking weed, and I fell asleep. I was woken up by my head being smashed into the wall which I was facing in bed, by the 'friend' whose place we were staying at. He wouldn't let me go back to sleep, and wouldn't leave me alone until I gave him head. It was so disorienting as a young teenager to experience this, but I knew I felt violated as I left in the early hours of the morning, went home, sat in the bath, and cried. The second instance occurred almost five years later. It started off consensual but escalated pretty fast. I was anally raped and hit, without being asked, and without any conversation about BDSM or anal. I live in fear of seeing my rapist, and I am tired. I am sad that so many of my friends (especially women) have experienced similar things.",,
I had boys sexually assault me for what I wore for a whole month for no reason (I’m pretty sure I was their target for a whole month).,,
"Ive had a man follow me into store in a very scary manor demanding my phone number,I had to lie to say I was engaged to get away.,I was sexually harrased on a train by three teenagers.,There are alot of men who act creepy, and stare and dont realise how this makes women feel.,They should try walking in our shoes and only then realise how it makes is feel.",,
"I took drama in year 10/11 as GCSE option, every lesson involved a hideous small group of boys rating us to our faces, who is fit who is ugly, who they would rape etc. I had my skirt ripped off me once it was so harrowing I will never forget those lessons. All of which happened in the presence of our so called drama teacher who never intervened he would just walk out and stay out for the majority of the lesson. We rarely had drama and to my knowledge we all failed. I don’t think any of those boys amounted to much in life and I declined every single Facebook friend request they made. The boys who were raised properly at our school were always respectful and have gone on to be great fathers with great careers. These idiots didn’t deserve to breathe the same air as me I know I was and am worth so much more than they ever were",,
"So basically I was 16 years old and my long term boyfriend who I was deeply in love with at the time raped me. Like he was really sexually attractive, like blonde hair and blue eyes, like all the other girls would get wet over him but one night he just said he wanted to do it and I was like ""I'm tired"". But he still did it anyway and I was kinda annoyed tbh. Like I haven't told anyone cus I want it be secret but it's been plaguing my mind every since.",,
"A guy that I had just started talking to and met just us for the first time after a bunch of group things at mutual friends houses or pubs. He started talking about sex and how much he wanted it and I said - no I didn't want too, I wasn't in the mood, please no but he begged and pleaded until I didn't have the energy to refuse anymore. I even remember him saying I looked uncomfortable but he was good at sex and I'd enjoy it. How have we not taught boys that no, physical attempts to stop sex and clear discomfort are so far from consent. This is the first time I have said anything as I felt to ashamed and guilty and didn't want the same judgment I had seen passed on to others.",,
"Was sexually assaulted by a woman from my university while at a friends party at halls. Mentioned this to university who simply told me to avoid coming into university if I was scared to see them again. I now rarely go in only with friends I feel safe. I don’t feel safe walking on campus alone either. I know young men who have been kicked out of this university when such cases came up. I am a non binary individual, with the societal appearance of a heteronormative male as of this I feel I have never been taken seriously in my account often having people giggle or smirk when I try explain what happened and feel like a lot of emphasis goes to support women’s accounts. This is important of course but we should not be making this a gender issue. Any victim of violence should be treated the same irrespective of gender or sex and no just men can be the violent aggressors",,
"My school only takes in boys for sixth form so you’d think a rather big concern for them would be safe guarding of their younger girl pupils, but a boy in year 13 got away with making a PowerPoint of all the girls (mainly in year 13) he would want to rape. People told our school and as far as we’re aware he received no reproductions besides his friendship group washing their hands of him. He was still allowed to stay at the sixth form and was still allowed to be around other pupils, including pupils as young as 11.",,
"When I was mabby 9 or around that age me and my brother were really close consider my brother was only 12 at the time , I new about sex and stuff but I wasn't to worryed about it like it was just how the world is so anyway when he asked me to come into his room in the morning before my parents woke up I said yes thinging we werr going to play he got me into his bed and took my clothes of I asked him what he was doing and he said he learned about something in school and wanted to try it to in short he put it in and started to push really hard after 10 mins of this he put out and pushed my head down I had no idea what was happening but I just accepted it. Schools should teach more about how it is not right to do IT with out concent. 4 years on and I still think about it. It has completely ruined our relationship and I will not let me touch him. I have never told my parents as I am to scared to.",,
"Raped multiple times by my boyfriend but I didn’t realise at the time. Very traumatic physically and mentally and had left scars which are still healing. The school did very little to make girls aware that consent has to be given every time, just because you give consent to a boy a few times does not mean he can have sex with you whenever he wants. The schools teachers often made inappropriate comments about girls Bras and sports uniforms and multiple girls were coerced into performing sexual acts in the school classrooms. The lack of protection and education about sex and consent was awful and the whole culture of the school was extremely misogynistic.",,
"In year 8 I was friends with this boy in my year and started spending more and more time with him. I was skipping sports training to be with him. We often hung out in one of the rooms in music block because there was no one there. It never felt weird in the beginning and the conversations we had were pretty normal. However, one time we were up there and he started pushing up against me and not letting me move. He slid his hands down my pants and started fingering me. At the time I don’t think I objected but I believe I was too scared to do so, so I just let it happen. After that day, he told everyone in my year and people started calling me names and calling me ‘easy’. It had given me a horrible reputation and it wasn’t anything like me. To this day I have tried to speak up to someone about it but it’s like a dark secret I’m too scared to talk about.",,

I noticed someone come up behind me and hug me, I panicked and froze.

I was waiting in the lunch queue and my family friends's friends were standing behind me. They told me about how my family friend said that he had sex with me everyday and then started chased me around school trying to touch me. This was when I was in yr 4. I told a teacher but they told me that it was just for fun and told me to shrug it off. I felt uncomfortable with that family friend whenever I saw them after that incident.,,
I was catcalled by a group of girls on a dark unlit road. Men can be victims too!,,
Last summer me and my boyfriend (ex boyfriend now) were having sex and we had done anal twice in the past we had a year relationship anyway while we were having sex he kept asking to do anal he was practically begging for it and I kept saying no I didn’t want to over and over and he said why and I said because I’m not in the mood to do it I was too scared to tell him I hated doing it. He kept asking it didn’t matter what I said. It took until I cried for him to finally stop asking and we finally stopped having sex for a bit but then the minute I stopped crying we just had sex again. And I don’t think he ever understood how uncomfortable it made me.,,

At first we ignored them as there was a plastic wall separating us from them - they got louder and started banging on the wall and pressing their genitals against it, they were asking us to leave and give them head. Once they left, I ran out and was heading to the tube, one of them was waiting outside and groped me. The other four followed us to the station where we ran on to the first train that came.",,
Was incredibly drunk after a night out with a friend and he crashed at mine after. Slept in the same bed and proceeded to have to repeatedly say no and push his hands away from me as he tried to convince me to have sex because it ‘would be fun and no one has to know’. This went on easily for a couple of hours. I feel lucky that at no point did I feel in physical danger but it’s so fucked that he thought it was normal to have to spend hours to try convince a girl into sex. I’m so glad in my drunken state I was able to say no for long enough until he finally gave up. Never spoke about it again with him and we’re still sort of friends,,
I would be walking around school and this one boy would keep groping my bum sometimes gently sometimes hard. I would continually ask him to stop but he wouldn’t and he would make me very uncomfortable and I would now always be looking over my shoulder when going around because I’m worried he would do touch me.,,
"My story is certainly not as bad as some of the ones on here, but I think results in enough discomfort to warrant me writing about it. I haven't been to any parties in over a year, understandably, but when I did I used to notice occasional 'cat calling' towards me and friends. I think as a guy, this is much less intimidating, and I hate to think how it feels being subject to these things as a girl, as for the most part I am physically larger than the girl or perhaps guys making the comments in question, but it's still not particularly nice. I think a long of guys turn a blind eye to this considering they are generally rather starved of compliments, and view these comments as that - boys/men never compliment each other, at least in my experience.,I have heard comments (assumptions) like 'he is packing' in real life personally but I feel like social media, especially TikTok has amplified these over lockdown. It is nowhere near as bad as some of the other stories on here, but comments about the desirability of someones genitalia - even if made casually or without malicious intent - are more upsetting than you might realise, and I feel perhaps there would be more uproar if the roles were reversed.",,
"I trusted a boy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] when I was young and he coerced me into sending him nudes, then took screenshots and sent them around to his friends and people at my school that he knew. I was then slut shamed for it.",,
"I was subjected to constant harassment from boys. They held up score cards out of 10 when we went in to chapel every week, used pages of porn mags and turned them into paper aeroplanes and sent them across the room to me and other girls while we were studying. Sometimes these were graphic drawings. I was a prefect in a boys' house at the age of 17 and had to get 16 year old boys into bed. This should never have been allowed. They would line up at the door and tell me to kiss their feet. I was pressured to have sex from one boyfriend who then told everyone in school that I wouldn't sleep with him. The boys in one class would drop pencils and look up our skirts so we wore long skirts. They made a petition to bring back short skirts and passed it round the class and then handed it to the teacher, who looked embarrassed, but did nothing. I hated every single minute of my time there. It was like a prison sentence with boys who just wanted sex and to degrade girls. Drugs were rife, as was witchcraft. I learned very little, except not to trust men. The worst moment was when I went to ask a male friend a homework question and over 10 other boys heard me talking and came into the room. They shut the door, barricaded it and threatened to rape me. It was only because the boy I had been talking to persuaded them to stop that they let me go. They just said, ""We could do anything to you right now and no one would know.""",,
"i had left my english class and walked down to the second level of the school, there i saw a guy who was in the same class i was currently in as me, he had approached me and cornered me in the corner of a wall and a door to a teachers bathroom in the cafeteria he was probably 2 whole feet taller than me then and was more than a 100 pounds heavier than me at the time he pushed me into the corner and grabbed my butt and pinned me against him and kicked my forehead i pushed him off of me and went to the bathroom and cried then went back to the same class with him i only ever told one person.",,
"I was in the Army. There's a constant culture of 'banter' that includes sexual innuendo and derogatory things. One night, I was sexually assaulted by a senior rank. He proceeded to beg me pretty much every day to not tell anyone...'it's just a joke'...'it's a bit of banter'...'I didn't mean it'. Over a year later I broke down and told. The Royal Military Police were involved and I was interviewed for a statement. The female officer made a point of asking what I was wearing. I asked why that was relevant and she said she had to ask. When I read through the statement, she had written that I was wearing 'a low cut top'. There was nothing I could do. When it was all over I was told the outcome after chasing it myself. I was told 'I should be grateful they're even telling me because they don't have to'. They also then told me to stop talking about it because 'the guy had been through enough'. Turned out he basically just got told that he was a naughty boy and to not do it again. Justice right there!",,
"When I was a fresher I met a final year student in an event one night. He offered to walk me home and then forced himself on me when we got to the front door. After a struggle, I pushed him away and got inside. He came back every night for at least a month. He would be sat waiting for me at all times of the day and night. In the end I stopped going home and spent the rest of the year sleeping on friends’ floors and sofas.",,
"When I was in year 5 the boy sitting next to me would touch my bottom over my pinafore and make sexual jokes about it to his friend, it really scared me but no one noticed and I thought it was a normal thing as I saw other girls being subject to similar things.",,
"When walking home from school age of 14, 2 boys I didn't know (not in school uniform) started chatting to me and walking along side me. I asked them to leave me alone but they didn't. They both started grabbing my boobs, in broad daylight, in the centre of Reading. It was the 1st time a male ever touched me and I felt dirty and like I had done something wrong. I've never told anyone until writing this out.",,
"A guy made sexual jokes, including those about slapping me in the face with his penis, and relentlessly intimidated me from the moment I joined in Sixth Form. He found it funny, even though I had told him I was uncomfortable and had asked him to stop. Eventually, it culminated in him slapping me on my arse and me reporting him. He was suspended, but the school did nothing to protect me from the social consequences of causing his suspension. A number of the boys in my year thought I was wrong to report it and that his behaviour had just been ’banter’. Boys would come up to me and ask me why I reported him and made me feel like I had made the wrong decision to report his sexual harassment. Ultimately, I was ostracised and was therefore stunted in my ability to make friends during my time there. Much worse things happened to other girls in my year which went unreported and unpunished. There was no education about consent, combatting rape culture, or any attempt to teach the boys that a lot of their 'banter' was incredibly harmful. I expected a better environment from such well-respected school, but a lot of the boys seemed to be incredibly misogynistic while the school remained practically silent on the issue.",,
"I'm currently 13. I was first cancelled when I was 7. It became a regular thing and I never had the courage to speak up about it. Men as old as 70 would say things to me like ""damn"" or ""pull ur skirt down a little there love."" Last year I was raped by a 15 year old. I was 12. I didn't tell anyone and I still haven't to this day. My mental health has never been the best but after I was raped, my confidence and self esteem has completely gone done. It still haunts me to this day and I find it very hard to talk about.",,
They took me to the toilets and raped my ass and made me bleed,,
I was 26 when I was raped by my boyfriend’s friend. He came into his bedroom one morning after my boyfriend had gone to work and got into bed with me. I told him I was naked in bed and he said that was why he was there. I repeatedly asked him to leave me alone but he told me I should feel lucky because he had “such a big dick”. After repeated attempts to stop him I eventually lay there and let it happen. Afterwards I felt shaken and ashamed and was covered in blood. I hide what had happened from my boyfriend by changing the bed sheets and taking them and a towel away with me. I went home and sat on the floor of the shower for hours. It wasn’t until a few days later that I fully appreciated what had happened and it wasn’t until then that I understood why women so often don’t report rape. My mental health has never been the same and I often have traumatic flashbacks. I have never told anyone about it.,,
"there has been multiple times boys have harassed me and looked up other girls skirts the school was aware , the male or teacher used to walk into the girls changing rooms whilst we was getting changed too.",,
"When I was walking home from school, I was approached by a girl whose group of friends were behind her. She came up and asked if her friend could suck my d***. I wasn’t hurt by this but instead would like to point out how messed up this is. In society, if a boy makes a comment like this, it’s sexual harassment, but if a girl makes the comment, it’s a joke. Let’s say we flipped the situation and I went up to a girl and asked to grab her breasts. It’s not impossible that I would no longer be free man and females feel as though they are able to get away with things like this and that’s just stupid. Our society has made me feel uncomfortable to walk behind girls in fear of being thought of as a stalker or a creep and I either slow down or cross the road. We need to erase not only rape culture but the act of passing it off as a joke if a guy is raped or a girl makes sexual advances on him without his consent. Why are only girls taken seriously but if a guy tells someone either the girl was joking or you must have enjoyed. NO. Guys need to give consent . Just because we are a guy or have a penis doesn’t mean that gives you automatic consent. And it’s not only society. UK law states that rape is penetration and that is so gendered. Guys have been affected by this but they are too afraid to respond to an opportunity because society has played it off as a joke for so long and completely ignored any rape claims by guys and this needs to stop. This is a call to all guys who have a story to share as well, please do so. Thank you to everyone’s invited for allowing me to share this.",,
He made me do sexual things I had not consented to by guilting me. He threatened things that damaged my mental health if I broke up with him. He has ruined all my friendships. I don’t know how to continue.,,
"I was 19 yrs old, sat dozing on a London Underground train when a guy sat down opposite me. He pulling his coat around himself and started masturbating while starring at me. I froze and pretended to be asleep. It didn’t stop. I decided to get up, gather my bags and look like I was getting off. He followed to the doors further down. When the doors opened, I waited and he waited. At the last second I pretended to leave the train and he jumped off just as the doors closed and I stayed on. I was totally horrified and frightened. I called my mum to tell her what had happened and she told me about a time she was chased home off a bus, almost like this happens to every woman. Worst part is, I now realise people on that train must have seen what he was doing but nobody did anything to help me.",,
I was at my friends house with another girl. She went to the bathrooms to get high and it was just me and him. He got on top of me and told me to open my legs. He tried to force himself on me but my friend came back just before anything bad happened. When she asked what we were doing he just said he was giving me a hug. It wasn’t ok.,,
Someone at this school kept harassing me to send them nudes and blocked me when i didn’t.,,
"i was at a football game and this boy came onto me and he kept asking me to kiss him and when i had said no i felt unsafe like he was going to hurt me so i texted my mom and i had her pick me up, he then started a rumor that he walked me home and we had sex",,
"In response to the latest spiking horrors. I am now 49 and have not been to a club in many years, however, when I did, I had my drink spiked twice. Once by a so called friend, the second time by God know who. Both times I had had very little to drink. First time I was left on the pavement outside the club for hours until the minibus arrived. The second time, I knew really quickly something was very wrong and called a taxi I used regularly. Luckily he got me home safely, where my husband found me unconscious on the bathroom floor. I have been driving longer than I ever was clubbing and have never had a car accident, so this is not rare, it is often it was always a problem, it is still a MASSIVE problem and it is terrifying. I got medical advice the first time, not the second, I did not report it as both times I was treated like I was blind drunk, which I was not. I do wonder how many of these never get reported. Ladies and young ladies, please can we speak up, we need this on record, on this site if there is no point going to the police.",,
"I’m a boy and this girl added me on snap. i didn’t know her at all and didn’t wanna talk to her. we started talking and i thought she was rly pretty. she then sent me pics of herself and i didn’t want them, i had never met her but only knew what she looked like. she then begged me for nudes and then when i said no, would say ‘oh you don’t think i’m fit then’ or just be really aggressive and make me feel bad. i blocked her but it’s rly sad to see.",,
"I was about 14/15. I was walking down the hallway at the end of the school day minding my business, listening to music and texting my friends. I wasn’t being fully aware of my surroundings, but I saw this one boy walk by me pretty fast. We both ended up going down the same flight of stairs. I noticed that he had stopped at the bottom of the stairs, so I assumed he was waiting on someone. As I was nearing the bottom but that’s whenI had a bad feeling in my stomach. As I tried to go around him he stood in my way, I’m a petite girl so I’m guessing he took his chance. He forced me against a wall and put his arm up against the wall almost in a way so I couldn’t move. He began to move his hand up and down my waist. My immediate reaction was to push him off of me and tell him no. Everyone was walking by and leaving because it was dismissal, but no one intervened to help me, even when they could here me yelling at this boy to stop and telling him no. He then saw I began to tear up and walked away smiling at me. I walked away with tears streaming down my face. I never reported it. His friends later apologized for his actions. But their words will never make up for the fear I had in that moment. I felt too embarrassed, and ashamed. I cried for months on end.",,
"Off the top of my head I can think of 3 occasions in the last year where I have had fully grown men pull over to talk to me whilst I’ve been walking on the pavement in my school uniform. On multiple occasions I’ve been asked to get in their car. This was on a main road, and after saying I don’t you, many members of the public simply ignored it, no one helped even though everyone saw.",,
"I went to a school friends party. A guy in the year above me attended. I drank and got sick. I went outside to thrown up, he followed me. Whilst I was hunched over he forced me and sexually assaulted me. This was my first sexual experience.",,

"Male teachers reporting girls that wear leggings, that are clearly covering everything, which makes it even more inappropriate because they are looking at them.",,
A boy in my year at school would repeatedly feel under my skirt while we were waiting in line for the bus after school. This started in year 8 and carried on for a few years. He would try and sit next to me or behind me on the bus as well and keep touching my legs and bum. He also asked me for nudes on social media and when I refused he blocked me but carried on trying to touch me all the time even though I kept asking him to stop. I used to go home and cry because it scared me so much and even now (4 years later) I hate getting on buses and sitting next to people I don't know because of this boy,,
when i was 13 i was asked out by this guy (who was also 13) i had recently came out as gay and he knew this i told him i didn't want to date him he then spent the next month trying to convince me to date him he told my friends i was leading him on and not giving him an answer they then spent weeks telling me to just date him non stop when they knew i was gay at the start he would message me maybe once every couple of days asking me out and i would say no by the end of the month he was asking me 50-60 times a day along with having my friends telling me to date him i gave in and dated him i knew what coercion was at this point but was nly told about it being sexual i didn't know that this was wrong until over a year later when we were told about it in school i felt very uncomfortable about the situation the whole time but i dated him so he would stop asking. non of my friends ever told me that what he was doing was wrong and openly encouraged it.,,
I was in year 6 (aged 10-11) and one lunchtime I got asked to go back to the classrooms early from lunch by I boy I barely knew in my year. He led me to the bathroom cubicles and brought me into one of the toilet stalls with him. He started ‘teaching’ me about sex and told me that we should go down on each other. This happened a few times and then he progressed to asking me to try and put myself inside him. He left the school later in that year for unknown reasons (we didn’t speak outside of the cubicles). I left at the end of that academic year. I didn’t tell anyone until I was 17. All of my closest friends know now and I am not ashamed to tell the ones I trust but it still stops me from sleeping some nights or creeps into my head when I’m having a bad day with my mental health.,,
"I was groped by a classmate when they sat next to me at least once a week, and felt like I couldn’t say anything because we were 13/14 and assumed it was something they just needed to grow out of."",After almost a year I told staff what happened which lead to an investigation but since it was deemed as consentual both parties had to be punished as cadets weren't allowed intimate relationship. I was sanctioned for a month and he was for four. The process seemed unfair as he wasn't held accountable for the actions he took, we both got into trouble and support wasn't offered to me.",,
"I was groped by boys in my year and explained stories of my sexual assault by other boys in my year only to be given a response of ""boys will be boys"" and its a ""rugby and football culture""",,
A boy at my school publicly showed a girls nudes to all the other guys around him. More and more boys kept asking to see and he showed them and they were rating her body. I told them to stop and they said that she shouldn’t have sent them to him in the first place and that it was her stupid decision.,,
"Both girls and boys would regularly take photos of other people in the class, without their consent. All of them knew it was wrong. When the boys did it , it was often posted on Snapchat , and there was so many derogatory comments about girls photos. I know for sure I've had my photo taken and shared. Knowing that there was very little I could do about it. I wish I had challenged it at the time , but it was just not that easy. There was also boys in my year , that would go behind girls backs and unclip there bras as a joke. This made me and others feel very uncomfortable, even though some of the girls laughed it off. Apparently it was ""a joke"". Not enough was done by the school, they obviously thought it was just guys larking about.In my first year , some random boy shouted over me ""what would you do if he raped you""? And he pointed to his friends, nobody around me said anything. I was just 12 at the time.",,
A teacher pulled on my mates skirt and shoved a skort up he skirt after she told him she was insecure about her thighs and didn’t want to wear a really short skort,,
"When I was 17, I had no self esteem so I was drinking away my problems, so this one day I was drinking with my brother in law, my sister and their friends. It got later and I was dancing with a few friends of friends and eventually this guy starts giving me the eye. We walk out of the gazebo, and on to the field and begin kissing. I was drunk so it escalated to what I thought at the time was fingering. I got home and literally peed out grass and blood and I was in agony. It wasnt until the next day when I sent the ""omg what happened text"" that he told me he had penetrated me. This is after a good hour of kissing and talking about how I wanted my first time to be in a bed and al that other american teen movie bs. It was only then I realised I had been raped. I locked myself in a dark room for two days and sobbed and eventually got the morning after pill. I felt so violated and as it was a first time it led to a very unhealthy view of what sex meant. It's only now 5 years later I realise what it is to be intimate and have respect for yourself during the act",,
"Once I was at a country party and I was sitting with my friend and a guy I had never met and we were on a sofa with a blanket on us and I felt a hand on my thigh and I thought it was my friend so I ignored it but then the hand started fingering me and I realised it was this guy I had literally just met doing it whilst his other arm was around my friend, so I just got up, grabbed my friend and walked away.",,
"a boy saved my explicit photos to his camera roll and then blocked me, he’s 16 and i’m 15",,
"I was around 12/13 and one of the 'popular' boys at school started messaging me. Id never been kissed or had any boys show interest in me, so was just happy that a boy was talking to me. We never used to chat at school, only message on our phones. One day he sent me a message asking me to show him my boobs. I didn't want him to stop talking to me so I did.Straight away after he asked me to sent a picture of me fully naked, I did this for the same reason I didn't want him to stop talking to me and spread gossip about me. He then asked for a photo of inside my vagina, at this point I was very uncomfortable and tried to diffuse the situation. He became more frustrated and aggressive over messages saying I needed to send him a video of me 'fingering myself' and zoom in on my genital area and if I didn't he would send all the other pictures around the school. At this point, I became very upset and confessed to my older brother what was happening and he messaged the boy to stop or he would call the police. it is fair to say the boy did spread gossip about me being a but none of the photos got shared. Reflecting back, I had not received any sex education or lessons on inappropriate photos or what to do when this happens. The whole situation made me feel very ashamed and alone. Over ten years on, I now realise I wasn't in the wrong and this was a form of sexual assault.",,
"I was walking home when I was 14 years old - it was about 7pm but it was winter so it was dark. I was walking down the road that my school is on as I know it well and feel safe there when a guy in his early 20s gets out of a car and asks me if I smoke weed. I said no and proceeded to walk. He asked me my name, I said don’t worry, he asked me how old I was, I said I was 13, one year younger to try and deter him. He said he “didn’t believe me”. It became clear to me that it didn’t really matter how old I was but he tried to clear his conscience by convincing himself I was older. I continued to walk at a fast pace and ignore him hoping he would leave me alone - I was on a fairly busy road so again had faith that he would give up if other people were watching. He continued asking me questions and asking for my number. It was when I got to the end of my road that I heard him running behind me. I turned around and showed him my phone where I said I was on the phone to my dad and to leave me alone because I wasn’t going to give him my number. It was at this point when I turned around to proceed walking that he grabbed my bum, far enough that he was next to my vagina, and squeezed. I was so shocked I slapped his hand away and ran home. It was my Dad and brother at home, my mum was away, but I didn’t tell them - I knew that if I did they would’ve gone out and beaten the shit out of him. But for some strange reason I wanted to spare him that. So I called my friend in tears and he got away with groping a 14 year old girl on her way home",,
"A guy I considered one of my closest guy friends continuously pressured me to send him pictures and sent me multiple unsolicited nudes. He would use our friendship against me and say if I didn’t send pictures we couldn’t talk anymore which felt like a a horrible ultimatum considering we were such good friends and I was so young i didn’t realise that it was wrong.,One time we stayed over after a friend’s house party (him on one sofa, me and a friend on another) when my friend went to sleep he repeatedly asked me to do bits with him saying it would be funny. I was very drunk and half asleep l, I kept saying I was too tired, I didn’t want to do anything and he kept pushing and pushing. I remember saying “I’m pretty much asleep, my eyes are closed but all I’m moving is my mouth right now to talk to you” and he said “that’s ok, all you need is to move your mouth”. I managed to kick my friend and wake her up for long enough that he stopped. I believe that if she hadn’t woken up I would have been tired and drunk enough to be worn down and just say yes. For so long after I felt uncomfortable being alone with guys, I felt I had to say yes to please guys so I wouldn’t have to go through the distress of saying no and not being listened to and that led to many other experiences in my future that had far worse consequences.",,
"I had met this boy through Instagram and we had gotten closer and liked each other. When we met for the first time we ended up going back to his house and we just chilled and talked for a while until I had to leave. From that point he had asked me to be his girlfriend in which I said yes as I liked him. We met a few more times in which we mainly were at his house and there was one occasion in which we were at my house. Every time we were together he would always want to kiss or hold hands in which to me is was weird but I just thought it was normal. But whenever we were in private he would always try to get me to suck him off or rub his d**k, he would also hump me as if he was having sex with me but we still had our clothes on, but he would always insist even on the day we met to have sex. On numerous occasions I had asked him to stop trying to dry hump me yet he continued to carry on and touch me, and ignored me every time I asked him to stop. At the time I didn’t realise what he was doing was wrong as he was my boyfriend and I thought it was normal, but later talking to my friends I realised he was in the wrong and had been sexually harassing me and trying to force me to have sex. I had dumped him before telling my friends what had happened, and I had dumped him at the time as he would take his frustration out on me and have a go at me in which I knew wasn’t right and I ended it with him. God knows what would have happened if I hadn’t had ended my relationship with him, but I’m thankful I ended it when I did to prevent anything more happening.",,
A few years ago in a nightclub I was kissing this guy and he stuck his hand up my skirt. He started fingering me really aggressively in the middle of the dance floor and I’m pretty sure other people were watching. He only grabbed me tighter when I tried to wriggle free so I disassociated and waited for it to be over. I didn’t think much of it at the time.,,
"Not of the same level as many stories here but when I was at university, I was out celebrating a friend's birthday. I turned up at the pub at the person celebrating saw me. He leaped on me, pushed me into a bush, his hands were all over me. He told me graphically what he wanted to do. I was with my boyfriend at the time so clearly wasn't interested in this guy who jumped on me. No one did anything. All the other friends laughed it off and said how much of a ""lad"" this guy was. My boyfriend was livid. I told him not to say or do anything so we didn't look like spoilsports. Everytime I saw the guy after that - he was the friend of a friend - he continued to touch me and ""flirt"" with me. I found it oo difficult to say something so I wrote to him and told him how it made me feel. He replied saying he knew I liked him and I enjoyed it really. He seemed genuinely surprised that I had an issue with him grabbing me in intimate places even though he knew I was in a relationship with someone else.",,
A male friend let it slip in year 9 that an innocent bikini photo from my Instagram had been shared to a WhatsApp group with most of the boys in the year. I felt ashamed.,,
I trusted I boy from school and he started showing and passing my nudes to other people with out my consent and they people started slut shamming me,,
"When I was 17 I went to a house party. At the end of the night I went to bed with a guy I was in a loose sexual relationship with and had consensual sex with him. Not long after he left the bedroom to go for a cigarette. 5 minutes later I thought that he had reentered the room but with it being dark I didn't realise that it wasn't him. This person proceeded to get into bed with me and began touching me which in turn led to him having full intercourse with me. I quickly realised that it was somebody else but I froze and did not know what to do. I lay quietly and waited for it to end and once he had finished he left the room without saying a word to me. I was confused and in shock and quickly dressed and left the house to go home. I cried all of the way home and felt so ashamed. The next morning a friend messaged me to congratulate me on having sex with both men. She said she didn't realise that I was such a 'dark horse slut' but thought it was awesome because other girls rarely bagged the second guy due to his high standards. Based on her reaction and the other reactions of friends in that friendship group it never crossed my mind that I had been raped. All I felt was ashamed and that I was a slut for sleeping with two men. I was so embarrassed I ended up cutting the whole friendship group off and was off sick from school for several months with what doctors thought was glandular fever but was never officially diagnosed. I know now that what was really wrong with me was I had fallen into a deep depression that prevented me from getting out of bed and functioning because I had experienced trauma and not processed it. It has been a decade since this incident and I only recently through counselling was able to see this incident for what it was. I was raped and the shame that I felt for freezing in that moment was not warranted. Being silent and taking it does not constitute as consent. But equally, the shame I experienced was a result of the culture my female friends were controlled by. The fact that they applauded me for validation from a man that had raped me (although they did not know the whole story) and called me a slut like it was a good thing was very wrong. This has stayed with me for so long and held me back in many situations because I haven't felt good about myself and believed that I was a bad person. I'm so grateful now at the age of 28 to understand what really happened that night and finally be over it. It wasn't my fault and by being silent I was protecting myself in the best way I knew how in that moment. I couldn't have known that if I had protested and said no he would or wouldn't have become violent or made a scene that ultimately resulted in other people at the party turning against me. The guy was never held to account for his actions because I remained silent out of shame. He used the experience to brag to friends labelling me as a slut. I doubt it even really crossed his mind what he had done and with everybody thinking that he was a nice guy no body would have believed it. This experience and the #not all men movement raises a lot of questions for me around consent and 'nice guys'. Experiences like this need to be told and men exposed because the education they receive on sex, consent and respecting women is not sufficient. It needs to change.",,
[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] Boys share nude photos sexually assault girls make contestant sexist and awful comments and everyone knows (teachers /friends) but no one does anything because they get amazing grades and they are protected by the ideology’s of boys will be boys and protected by all adults around it - it’s not only a group of people there it’s the whole culture there.,,
"Reading the stories breaks it but heart to see how little things have moved on, I’m 46 but remember being felt up to see if I was wearing a bra, being scored, the ‘game’ arches, a particular corridor near drama where the boys would turn the light off having already identified the victim they liked who would then get ‘drapsed’ or as I now understand it sexually assaulted. The comments, the slurs, how we as girls were all pressured, cajoled, forced into doing things we didn’t want to do. 30 years on it’s all still happening, this is what Rape culture looks like.",,
Previously While being a younger teen and naive i was always use by older boys me being 13 while they’d be 19 I though this was “cool”! I never wanted to give them head but they would insist while pushing me on my knees shoving their pants off while they grabbed my head to force me to give them head and lifting my chin up to make me swallow. Many other event happened like this as a young teen but I though this was normal. Until this summer ( now 18) I was at a party heavily on mdma when I saw a friend in distress while surrounded by men in there late 20 early 30s. I went to see if she needed help she was drunk to the point of passing out. I asked her if she wanted me to grab her anything to eat this is when one of the men in their late 20s grabbed my ass with one and with the other grabbed my shoulder while pulling me in for a kiss. I was with my boyfriend at the party but he was somewhere els when this happened I instantly looked around trying to find him. Being one of the youngest in the party I felt instantly isolated scared and panicked (this didn’t help as I was on a new strange drug). My body froze and the girl in the group of men who is firstly trying to help started laughing with the other men. Finally finding my boyfriend amount the crowed of people I started crying as I told him what had happened I felt trapped started overthinking it was what I was wearing ( I had just jeans and a hoody on) I needed to leave get away I felt like running off my boyfriend calmed me down instantly made me feel safer and we kept on partying. Even he was unsure how to approach the man im grateful he didn’t. Later that night the men that surrounded me had badly beat up some of my friends to a point where their head where bleeding. I’ve never felt so trapped nervous and afraid. I though this was “normal” for too long until this summer where I understood all the times before where sexual assault. I’m still with my boyfriend who I feel safe with but I have extremely bad sleep paralysis where a man is in my room I don’t know if this is related to all the men who assaulted me but I struggle with it very offten.,,
"We were friends but hadn’t spoken for a while. when he texted me we spoke normally and then he asked me about a rumour that he heard about me loosing my virginity. he kept asking me who i lost it to and i tried to laugh it off originally but when i realised it wasn’t a joke i begged him to drop it for hours. my family is very religious, and i was struggling with my sexuality and was terrified of more people hearing about me loosing my virginity. he told me that if i didn’t tell him by a certain time he would ask around, spreading it further. he then gave me an ultimatum that either i told him who i lost it to or he would ask other people or i could send him nudes and he would leave it and not screenshot. i sent him a picture shirtless without my face in it and he took a picture of it on another device and put it on his social media. 2 years later i found out that my new boyfriend was friends with him and he told me that i shouldnt of told people what he did to me because it “gave him a bad reputation” i never lied and the only people i ever told were my friends. he showed countless people my picture. i tried everything to make it stop. i was used to being used for my body and just wanted it to go away. he knew i was uncomfortable and still manipulated me. i still have people bring it up to me. i was 15 when it happened",,
"This boy took pictures of me in sex positions without me consenting and when i confronted him he told me that he wouldn’t share it, it was only for himself which was so bs. then he told me to shut up and that i should behave otherwise he would do bad things to me and as a scared victim i just stood silent. he got angry with me trying to get him to delete the pics so he pushed me over and then said you’ll behave after this and raped me. it haunts me to this day",,
"i was 15, at a party. a boy who i didn’t know kept trying to get off with me and even though i was repeatedly saying no, he kept putting his hands up my thighs and under my skirt. i eventually escaped to go to the toilet, then rejoined the party, but it turned out he had spiked my drink, then made me go upstairs with him and raped me. i was practically unconscious, upstairs with him for over an hour, and would not have been able to get away from him myself afterwards had my friend not found me. it was my first time and i still feel the emotional effects to this day, nearly 3 years later.",,
"One night I was out with a friend it was in summer and it was still light we were going to a guy friends house on the way there this is like a 10minute walk from my house these two guys shouted out to us hey baby girls wanna come for a ride with us we are only starting highschool and these men are in their 20s it looked. They continued shouting stuff,whistling etc. We felt so violated we sprinted to my friends house and on the way home we had to walk past them again."",It concerns me that those boys felt it were okay to do that, and while a lot of them (hopefully all) will have grown up to understand that it’s okay not to hunt girls down and grab them, it scares me that for a couple behaviours like that will have been subconsciously normalised. That they’re the ones who follow girls around clubs and grab and grope without consent. That they’re the ones who maybe do worse.",,
He kept sending me creepy messages talking about what he would do to me sexually and even after i went to our head of year he did nothing and its still carrying on,,
"I was sexual assaulted outside of school not by a student, by a man in his 20s when I was about 13/14. I finally decided to talk to someone about how I was struggling with sleeping, eating and how I am haunted everyday with the fear of it happening again. It happened within the safety of my own home and no one seemed to care, it was completely like it never happened. I tried speaking and no one helped. In school, at home. No one. It was completely downplayed because he hadn't raped me. I was lucky and that's all anyone cared about. As long as I wasn't raped it doesn't matter ? Thats what it seemed like. However I am left years after the assault still scared because no one was there for me. I confided with people in school and they didn't help.",,
I was harassed by a student boy to be gay as he wanted me to be his boyfriend and the school and police have done nothing to support me the school said it’s my fault and it would blow over I moved school as a year later he was still perusing me,,
"He grabbed hold of my chest area. Because they couldn’t directly see it on camera, he got away with it. And has done it to multiple people since. I feel so guilty, that he got away with it and managed to do it to others.",,
"I was sleeping in a tent with about 6 people after a party and the boy next to me (who was a mate, had a gf and knew I had a bf) repeatedly groped me all over and humped me really aggressively. I’d tell him to stop and he would, wait until I fell asleep, then I’d wake up to him doing it again. This went on for a couple of hours. I was begging him to stop under my breath, he wouldn’t listen and I didn’t want to make a fuss, but eventually I had to move to the other side of the tent. The next day he started talking about how some other boy at the party was a predator and seemed genuinely surprised when I called him a hypocrite in front of everyone. Perhaps he just expected me to go along with it. He’s since claimed not to understand why I want nothing to do with him",,
i was assaulted in the school bathroom by 3 boys. i told my school this happened and no one believed me. everyone who knew about it thought i t was my fault and that i shouldn’t have gone into the disabled toilet with them but i thought they were my friends,,
"a boy two years above me in school harassed and sexually assaulted me in a forest far from my house, i thought he liked me but then found out he was doing this to many other girls, some even 3 years below him. he would force me to go on ‘walks’ with him and would assault me while on those ‘walks’. i still can’t look at him or pass by him without freezing up and nobody has done/said anything about it or to him.",,
"Every friday became grab ass day, boys were allowed to slap, grab, and do anything to our asses and teachers did nothing. I saw so many girls have to wear their book bag real low or a sweater on top of their butt to cover it. It was disgusting.",,
I had a boyfriend when I was super young. Once we were doing immature stuff and I was naked and he had his boxers on. He put the tip in me and asked me if I felt it. I didn’t and I told him cuz I didn’t know what was happening. He continued to do that until he cummed. When I realised what had happened he laughed while I cried. I was so upset and didn’t tell anyone until I got into a new relationship and spoke to him about it and he told me it was rape. I spoke to my other friends and they all said it was. Just because you love the person doesn’t mean they can’t rape you.,,
"There was an about 36 years old teacher at my school. He forced students to write something on the board so he could take a look at their butts. One day he walked past a girl and her boyfriend and slapped the girls butt quickly. Of course she thought it was her boyfriend, but then some other girls started talking about what they just saw. They all became witnesses. I was so scared of him because he was my maths teacher and wanted to talk to me after class. You already know what happened in the classroom. At least he got arrested after this incident thank god",,
The boy in my year at school used to always beg me for pictures of myself I used to always feel so uncomfortable around him,,
When I was 14 I was pressured into having sex and taking my clothes off when it was -2° and we were outside. I still get flashbacks whenever it’s too cold and it brings me back to that night.,,
"When I was 14/15 a guy who was 19 would drive me and my friend (also 15) around in his car and buy us alcohol and encourage us to camp out and party on the beach. We use to think we were so cool having an older friend... he’d pressure us to get drunk, get naked, and kiss at these parties. Looking back now I can see it was grooming.",,
"I got with a guy in a club. He never left me alone after that, even though I made it clear I wasn’t interested in anything more than that. He came to every event I was out and literally followed me round nightclubs persistently asking me out even when I practically shouted to leave me alone. I eventually stopped going out when I thought he might be there. It was a joke among my friends and it didn’t bother me that much until I realised one of my closest friends had been encouraging him the whole time, and telling him when I’d be out, even when he knew how uncomfortable I was.",,
"In the uniform rules it said that a girls skirt had to be 10 cm above the knees when kneeling. So several teachers made girls kneel to measure their skirts. I remember walking out of cathedral and seeing teachers taking girls off and making them kneel on the cathedral floor just to check their skirt length. This is the same school that would not let us show our ankles and made us wear full tracksuits of we were in our sports kit even if it was 30degrees and the middle of summer. The saddest thing was that female teachers even enforced the blatantly sexist rules. They made us think that our bodies should be covered and that it was our responsibility to make sure men wouldn’t look at us. This is the same school where guys used to go around daring eachother to grab girls asses. And the same school that instead of dealing with reported racism, sexism and bullying in the school, decided instead to change the uniform so that girls skirts were below the knee and couldn’t be rolled up,like that was the biggest problem they had.",,
As a child I was told that I was worthless and useless and just blaitently told I was wanted and all the way through secondary school I progressed worse my dad would make these lies up and my mom would constantly say she would want a different daughter like it would make me feel like crap and I’d tell myself that it’s just cuz she’s having a bad day but no it would go on to get worse and worse and then often I’d go to sleep crying and not being able to stop and that’s when self harming would start. Y8 was when I would start scratching the back of my ankle or the side because I know nobody would see there I’d just scratch till I bleed or till my skin is peeling. Then one day it got so worse I got an infection where I had scratched myself and I couldn’t say the truth about what had happened because just no. I ended leaving my ankles alone and they would heal but I have so many scares left over it’s horrible and because my mental health is already terrible all the yelling that constantly happens makes it worse and makes me wanna start hurting myself again but I can’t it’s just the way my body adapts to the pain.so these atleast one good thing to come out of it the fact I can no longer self harm but mentally it’s not working very well,,
"I was was on my school bus when I was twelve their was me two other girls and then a 16 year old guy and another 15 year old guy. I used to have a little crush on the 15 year old and one time I kissed him I pulled away but he kept trying to kiss me I said for him to stop and he called me a pussy and that I was a 'prude' the other guy the 16 year old used to put his finger up when I sat down on the chair so it would go up my vagina at first I didn't really understand then over time I did. I used to tell him no and that it wasn't funny but both of the guys and the girls would tell me it was just a joke and I needed to go along with it to get it to stop. I went along with it and it just got worse, one time it was just me one girl and both of the guys they told me to play strip or dare with them I didn't really want to but the other girl told me that she was doing it and I'd ruin the fun if I didn't, so I di it, I played that game twice I was 12 and they used to always get me to take my top off first.",,
a boy would go round touching girls bums and boobs and pretending to fall so he could lay on us when we were sat down. he would stand infront of us and put his crotch in our faces purposely when we asked him to stop.,,
"""I was raped in university by a peer in the same sports team as me. We were both very drunk on tour and we walked back from the club together. We said goodnight to eachother but I was locked out of my hostel room so he politely let me sleep in his bed. Everything was fine, we were friends and we went to sleep.,I woke up with him trying to put his p*nis inside me and was confused as I was drunk and half asleep. Then I felt that he had cum on my skirt. I can't remember the conversation we had initially in the room but then we both went to the bathroom and I was pretty confused, angry and sad at the situation once it had sunk in a bit more. We argued - I screamed at him a lot to be honest. He repeatedly denied doing anything but when I asked him if I should get the morning after pill he said yes so that was enough of a conclusion about what happened.,I didn't mention this to anyone at the time and sadly he went around telling everyone I had sex with him even though I was asleep. People to this day still think I actively chose to have sex with him. I don't understand how he even thought that we did since I made no noise, I literally don't get how it could have been a mistake.,I have heard multiple stories from other girls about bad things he's done to them and he also physically assaulted my male friend on multiple occasions who was his flatmate at the time. He used to lock his bedroom door whenever he was drunk in fear of what he could do.,""I was in year 2, and this guy from an older year took me behind a bush and started fingering me, i was really young and all i wanted to do was play with my friends so i didn’t say anything but i tried to push him away",,

I thought that I did something wrong and that's why I lied bc my mom had told me to stay away from that boy.",,
"I have been raped by someone who I thought was a friend. The person was someone I had already had sex with before multiple times. I told them “ I don’t want to have sex”, “ I feel too unwell to have sex”, “ I want to go home”, “ please stop”, “ stop now”. The person continued and continued to force sex upon me despite this. This person lives in Tolworth and they are studying at University of East London. Almost every time I leave the house men whistle at me, shout at me, beep their car horn, or try and speak to me in a way which is overly flirty, sexual, and which makes me uncomfortable. I have experienced men of a similar age do this, but also men who are much older (40+). I have experienced men who approach me at bars and who won’t leave me alone, who will follow me, who will treat me as a sex object. Things need to change NOW.",,
Between the ages on 5-13 I would visit my grandparents house with my brother. We would go there alone for the day and my nans sisters husband would sometimes be there too. He always wanted me to sit next to him and chat to him on the sofa. He would put his hands on my lower part of my body and would rub near my vagina. It took me years and years to understand what he was doing. He was sexually assaulting/ molesting me. One day my nan said ‘pull your shorts higher up’ and looked over to where I was sitting. It was then that I realised that she had noticed what he had been doing to me and didn’t confront him about it. From then on I never sat near him again.,,
"As a young girl in a big city like Manchester I knew I would have to be careful from the get-go but I never expected it to be as unsafe as it is. In broad daylight I would be afraid to walk to the shop on my own for fear of my life. The security in [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is appalling. Specifically on Halloween when it was known to everyone that it was going to be a busy night, lots of freshers out on campus, partying in dorms. So many stories from that night surfaced as I noticed many 40-45 year old men sneaking into the flats and finding drunk girls. No security stopped them.",,
Someone took a photo from under my skirt without my consent when I was only 12. This happened in school,,
I was sexual assaulted,,
It as after a party in a park. Everyone else gradually left until it was just me and this boy. We were talking then he started trying to strip me. I was really drunk and said no but he kept going and fingered me etc telling me he was only not having sex with me because he didn’t have a condom. His friend walked past and laughed. It was right next to a public path i was loudly saying no and nobody stopped it. He told his friends later I was begging for it,,
It’s an absolute joke that the debate around the [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] ranger song is still going. After [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] there were so many incidents of inappropriate sexual behaviour and use of the song in public places that 1) the press got involved and 2) the girls school created a targeted campaign around sexual assault that was brought to the school as a day of talks and group discussions. Ofc the boys school managed to get the press to back off so nothing happened apart from the initial outrage. On the day of the talk a lot of boys in my year refused to go or refused to participate. To see that there’s STILL a problem with the song and the boys school in general 5 years on is fucking ridiculous and heartbreaking.,,
Two boys were playing a game to grope me.,,
"When i was 14 i started dating my childhood best friend and he was two years older than me. Everything was going alright until about a month in he was already asking me for sex and wanted to do stuff i wasn’t comfortable with. I kept on saying no and how i wasn’t ready and at first he said okay, about two weeks later he came with me in a family holiday and stayed with me in the same room. I hadn’t slept well one of the nights so the family went out but we stayed behind, he then asked me again if we could have sex and i said no, but this time he didn’t want to hear it he started taking off my clothes then got his dick out grabbed my hair and made me suck him off he then started touching me inappropriately and grabbing my boobs. Luckily my family came back at that point and shouted hi and he stopped but at that point i didn’t think anything of it. Then a few months later he stayed at mine for the night as my parents had gone away and he tried again this time he blackmailed me into telling people i was willing to do it and it was my choice otherwise he would start sending photos of me around so he took my phone and put it on a group chat with lots of other people. A month later i then found out he was cheating and i broke up with him when i realised what he had done i blocked him on everything and never had contact with him again but he probably doesn’t realise how badly it’s affected my life.",,
"I was raped by my best friend when I was 18 in my own bed and to this day he denies that it happened. At the time he had a girlfriend (of who he is still with) and as far as I know she does not know about the assault. I’ve never shared my assault publicly, but close friends and family know about it. I hope one day I am able to publicly expose him for what he did and tell his girlfriend what happened.",,
I was walking back to class in the halls when two guys came up to me and grabbed everything. pushed me against the wall and said if i told anyone they’d hurt me more.,,
I was pressured into sending nudes in year 8 and they got leaked and my whole year found out,,
I was only 9 years old when it started happening. I am in so much pain and anger. It all started in year 4 when my teacher had asked me to stay after class after everyone went. He then locked the door and I was very confused. He started undressing me and i wish i had done something but i froze in silence. I was too young to understand what he was doing to me. I am still disgusted everytime I think about it. I remember him taking off his trousers then he started doing the sexual things to me. He started doing it more often so each week he would get me to stay after class for a little 'talk' when that 'talk' was really sexual activities. I am still traumatised till this day and I will never forget what he did to me.,,
"i had been dating this guy for a couple of months we were about 14/15 and he would always talk about sex and him wanting me to touch him, i would always say ‘another day’ or not right now. until he broke, screamed at me in my face saying that the relationship wont move on , baring in mind we were 14/15 why would i care but something shook me my stomach was completely empty until he stopped shouting and made me put my hands down his trousers. I never knew this wasn’t normal or what being pressured into sexual things until around 4/5 months ago Im 16 almost 17 and i still refuse to tell anyone.",,
"I was 13 he was 14 we were at our friends house watching a movie on the couch. Me and him were cuddling but then he asked for a blanket.Once he put the blanket over only me and him he started touching up all over my body. I was very uncomfortable and made it very clear. He didn’t care. He didn’t ask for permission. He started kissing me down my neck, tracing his fingers under my bra, then he proceeded to go lower and fingered me. It was out nowhere I felt his fingers go into me while I held the tears back. I was too scared and in shock to speak up especially with our friend beside us. That day I ran home crying. He promised he wouldn’t do it again but this happened over and over again to the point I can’t count how many times. It would always be without consent and sometimes when I would fall asleep during movies. He didn’t care if our friends were around or of it was in public.",,
I was year 8 (12) (northern ireland) and I was groomed by an upper 6th (17-18) and I didn't know it until last year.,,
"When I was 13 a boy I really liked continued to ask me for nudes despite knowing how uncomfortable I felt with it. However I really liked him and wanted to make him feel the same way and so after months of persuasion I sent one, which he then screenshotted and sent to his friends. Many of his mates then messaged me threatening to share my nudes if I didn’t send them more. I still worry that people will bring it up now and have even been told by girl friends that they have seen my nudes which is totally humiliating",,
"It was during my first year of a levels. He touched my thigh under tables when and where he could, called me to his closed off office to try and kiss me or touch me. I felt sick. I left school without getting my alevel and now have panic attacks with male teachers or men in a position of trust/authority. Compliments like ‘you look nice’ or even ‘you remind me of someone’ I think of when he’d say it to me. even now years later it makes me feel on edge. He booked a hotel room near my house and asked me to meet him. He put me in a position where I felt happy and like I needed him (he knew I had issues at home) and felt paralysed with fear at the same time.",,
"On my way back from a night out, I stopped to take shelter because it started raining. A man came over and started chatting to me. I asked if he had a spare cigarette and he said if I wanted it I had to give him a kiss. I went along with it because I thought it was a bit of fun. However, he started following me on my way home and ended up pulling me into an alley where he raped me behind some bins. It was the most traumatic experience of my life. Afterwards, I tried to get support from my uni well-being services but I just got the impression that they were too busy and didn’t care as sessions were rushed and the initial wait was so long. I’m not sure if the man was a student/had been a student but the support I received from the university was more or less non existent.",,
My experience in this school was overall horrible I was mistreated by a lot of people but one person in specific always got to me on a whole new level he would call me names like f*g and g*mp and I would see him staring at me in classes it got to the point that I was afraid to go near him and even show up but one day I did show up and he came up to me in the middle of everyone and grabbed my face and kissed me everyone around me laughed and I made a weird noise shoving him away and again he called me a f*g later that day near the end of the school day i seen him again and he looked directly at me and grabbed his pelvic area through his trousers and started laughing I walked away in fear and after that I started making excuses not to go into school till I finished,,
"When I was 4 to the age of 8 i was touched by my older cousin. When i was 5 I was also touched by my grandma’s neighbor who was two years older than me. I feel like I’ve gotten over it but when I look back I realize how much it affected and still affects me in ways I didn’t realize. In middle school, a guy I had a huge crush on would snap me all the time, til one time he asked for nudes, and he begged and begged, so I sent them, after that it became a routine. I lost my virginity at a really young age (12) it was consensual and he was 13 at the time. But I often wonder if I wouldn’t have gotten sexually assaulted at a young age I wouldn’t have thought that sex and showing off my body was “no big deal”. I’ve had countless encounters with men in my teenage years where they would touch me inappropriately and I never had the back bone to say anything. I just wish I would’ve spoken up when I was a kid, now i’m turning into an adult full of regrets. I haven’t slept with anybody since that boy because now sleeping with men makes me feel uncomfortable, like it’s insincere and I don’t want to feel like I’m being used anymore. Anyway I just had to get that off my chest.",,
"From year 7 boys would grope girls in the classroom, slap our asses for a laugh and make several inappropriate comments. By year 9 they were pressuring girls for nudes, harassing us into sexual acts, I learnt to wear shorts to give me an extra layer of protection from boys putting their hands up my skirt, they started whole accounts on Snapchat to publicly post girls nudes and release their names. In year 10, groups of boys would run into the girls changing room while we were getting changed for PE and the teachers gave them some detentions after they repeatedly did this for WEEKS. All they got was detention. They wouldn't take no for an answer. They were constantly inappropriate and for many years I accepted this as a part of life but now I am in 6th form and I have endured this for 5 years. They don't harass me anymore, not since I got a boyfriend in year 11, apart from a couple of boys who still grabbed my ass anyway as I passed by them. Instead, they prey on younger girls, I've heard them talking amongst themselves in class as they admit to speaking to girls as young as 12, reminder these boys are 17. The entire time I've been at this school I've faced sexual harassment and I don't feel anything was ever done which is crazy considering the pure scale of what was going on. It was multiple boys, multiple times a day for about 5 years. I became close friends with one boy who let me in on some of the secrets of the other boys. He told me about the one who goes to party's to find the drunk, sad girls so he can be guaranteed sex, the one who cornered a girl in a house party bathroom and wouldn't let her leave until she gave him oral sex, the ones who are essentially rapists, the group chats where they would share all the nudes they had from girls together and all kinds of horrifying stuff. The teachers do nothing and our sex ed is appalling, we never covered consent, sexual harassment or anything like that despite its massive presence throughout the school. Some of the girls in the younger years have spoken to me about being pressured to send nudes by boys in their year, they're only 11 years old. A girl in year 9 told me about the boy in her year who walks a similar route home to her and has cornered her in the woods to harass her for oral sex. Girls aged 11-15 tell me about the unwanted hands grabbing at your thighs, sliding up your legs, the inappropriate comments and groping. What's even sadder is some of them have probably experienced worse and don't want to talk about it. It saddens me to see these young girls are dealing with the same thing that I had to and once again, nothing is being done. Being a girl in [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was exhausting and while the place is nostalgic, I can't wait to leave and be rid or those boys forever.",,
Daily this boy would sexually harass and assault girls but because I was quiet and wouldn’t talk back as much he did it more towards me than others (even though I did say to stop multiple times) to a point where I was just known as the person he would do it to in class. I finally told a teacher but he cried when being confronted so it’s my fault for ‘lying’ about it and he was innocent for showing emotion. Then the next year another boy would daily harass me when I had told him to be quiet and stop talking to me about things but he kept doing it anyways.,,
"When I was at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] a boy sexual assaulted me under the desks in class for an entire year. He'd send me explicit photos of himself and pornographic links and videos. He'd tell me to kill myself if I ever got upset about it and I didn't tell my parents for a year in fear that I'd get into trouble. Now it's left me with extremely severe OCD which makes me feel as if I have to protect girls like me all the time by moving around objects etcetera. The police didn't punish this person and high school swept it under the rug. The police had evidence of screenshots and a confession of the naked photograph, but still didn't proceed with any form of punishment. I'm disgusted at the entire system on how I was treated. I'm still unhealed and not the person I was, constantly worrying about people's safety other than my own. I hate that imature boy and I always will",,
"I was in primary school and I was 7 when I was tackled by a 11 year old and his brothers and they all tried to take turns kissing me in the playground as I was trying to get away, I managed to get away but I was 7 and it was terrifying. When I was 10 in the same school in a boy came up behind me and slapped and grabbed my butt thinking it was ok, I went to a teacher but he was excused because he ‘wasn’t from the country and didn’t speak English’ he was never told it was wrong. Now it’s almost been 10 years since the first incident and I still deal with stuff like this, there is this one boy at my school, who takes the bus an hour after me but when I have to do a after school club I have to take that bus. At first I thought this boy was my friend but he got creepy really fast, when I get on the bus he will stare me up and down , try make me sit in the empty seat next to him and when I don’t, he will spend the entire hour I’m on the bus staring at me, it makes me feel so uncomfortable I don’t do after school clubs anymore and when I have to stay after school I hide under the seat so I don’t have to deal him. When I get off the bus he stares at me through the window, and this happens very time.",,
I have been raped,,
An ex of mine one time didn’t want to stop having sex with me even though I said I was in pain. His reason being was that he didn’t cum. I let him finish just because he got was getting really pissy with me. Afterwards I couldn’t look at him the same as I knew he didn’t care if I was enjoying myself or in pain I was just there for his enjoyment. I ended things pretty soon after that .,,
"I was in a music class and a boy was sat next to me. He repeatedly kept grabbing my thigh. I repeatedly moved his hand away and told him to stop. I started crying and the music teacher looked at me, making eye contact, then carried on with what he was doing.",,
My first and only experience of sexual assault was from my dad. The one man a girl should be able to trust. He was drunk and grabbed my bum. It’s never happened again but makes me feel sick whenever I think about it.,,
"In the light of the other testimonies here, mine seems pretty trivial, but I still would like to share it. I have not been to many parties, have never had a boyfriend and am more of a ""nerdy"" type, so it was a shock to me when I realised a) that I was in a position where I could be sexually harassed b) that I had been dealing with this harassment for years without acknowledging it for what it was. The first incident was in Y7. My shirt slipped when I was leaning over a desk; several people saw, and I was wearing no bra. One of the boys who did so later made comments about how ""ugly"" my breasts were. Some years later, I was chatting with another boy whom I hardly knew when he asked me - out of the blue - if I shaved my pubes. When I complained about this to his friends, they told me 'it's a joke', 'that's just the way he is' and 'he can be rude sometimes'. I was so frustrated that I found him during lunchtime and screamed at him to stay away from me. This, too, was dismissed as down to my ""craziness"". Finally, this year I was in lessons wearing a relatively tight top when a boy sitting behind me commented, again, on the size of my breasts. What enrages me most of all is the reaction of many of the people I thought would support me - I was not angry because he had slighted my body, but because he shouldn't have thought himself in a position where he was able to do so. He was not my boyfriend, we were not on those kind of terms and it was simply not appropriate. I have complained about these incidents before; some action has been taken, but nowhere enough. I am not surprised that there are so many testimonies from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The culture there is toxic and the boys feel as though they can comment about our bodies with impunity.",,
"Okay this is a super raw topic still and i have to speak to the police tomorrow but i was sexually assaulted kind of i know its all my fault but i was in art club after school with this boy who i was kinda friends withthe boy who i sat by, i went to get a laptop and he pulled the chair closer to him and i just sat downhe started writing things on his computer and showing them to me, he later on gropedmy thighs and i didnt say he could. After this i was putting my painting back but asked him to go with me because the shelf was heavy he started fingering my bumhole. And pulled my pant strap. After that we were going home and he squoze my boobs. Without consent i mean its my fault because i sent him tit pics but still i never said yes i love you all and hope no one has to go through this.",,
"I was walking home from school with one of my guy friends that I trusted, I had recently moved house and he agreed to walk with me and show me the way. School had just finished so we were both in uniform. He told me we were taking a short cut, but took me into a dead and and asked if I would have sex with him. I said no and he started begging and really pressuring me. He ended up trying anyway, putting his hands up my skirt and touching me. When I came out about it, nobody believed me and I was even beaten up by his friends. The police wouldn't do anything because I was only 15.",,
"My story is in no way comparable to the others . but my ex pressured me into sending on more than one occasion. whenever anyone asks i always say i haven’t sent to him bc i’m ashamed that i didn’t say no enough and that i let myself be pressured into it. he didn’t save them, but he cld hv done the secret ss on snap. he was like “do it for me” “if you love me you’ll do it” and i kept saying that i wasn’t in the mood or jus saying no. it got the point where he didn’t speak to me for like a week on both occasions bc i said no. and then he wld pu again and ask, so i jus did bc i needed the convo w him and i jus needed to talk bc we were together. i haven’t told anyone this.",,
I walked into the school cafe with my friend when we were 13 and the lower sixth boys (16/17) were rating the girls walking in. I got a low mark as well as my friend and it completely ruined our night and had long term repercussions on my self image,,
"I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend, he tried to force me to put my hand down his trousers. I was 14. I screamed and pulled away he laughed and said it was a joke. The memory ruined my childhood playground. At 16 I got drunk and became unaware of anyone’s actions around me. I remember someone on top of me trying to remove my trousers after that my memory is blank.",,
"I was sexually assaulted twice in this school by people in years above me. i was in year 8/9 at the time and they were in year 11, i was touched in certain places by this group of lads when walking to my art classroom. i tried to get help but the people that did it were not found. it was a few years ago now. around the same time a bit later, i was on the school grounds and a group of lads walked past me and started making crude comments at me and touched me inappropriately again. i didn’t even see who they were.",,
[date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] in my own home. i was 16 then. for awhile i didn’t know if it was considered rape or valid enough because i never technically said no or tried to fight him off because i was frozen the whole time it’s like i was watching it from outside of my body. he thought i was sleeping. he’s like 28 i was 16. it’s not like there wasn’t obvious signs before this incident actually happened he was always so weird and touchy for months and my family brushed it off as if it was nothing so i did too until [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. it was 2:13am when it started and 2:20 when he got up and went to sleep on the other side of the couch from me. he has two very young daughters 4 & 8. i really hope they never have to experience anything like that in their lifetime.,,
"Photos of my naked underage body (fifteen at the time) were spread around school by my ex boyfriend... on my birthday... These photos were shared around my school and four other schools in the area, in many group chats, and to teachers (who did nothing about the situation)",,
I was groped by the guy who lives in the flat above me at university. Everyone made out as though I was being over dramatic to it.,,
"I was coerced into sex by a boy when I was 18. At the time I knew something about what had happened felt off. I was pressured into going back to a boy’s house after a night out during which I had consumed alcohol and drugs. I felt obligated to have sex with him since I went to his house even though as soon as I got there all I wanted to do was leave. However, he then said he didn’t have a condom to which I said that we couldn’t have sex as I was not on birth control and worried about the risk of STDs. He promised he’d pull out and I explicitly said my answer is still no. I said no multiple times while he pleaded with me and pressured me. I said no again and turned around to go to sleep. I was half asleep when he started grinding on me from behind and penetrated me. At this point I was so exhausted and just wanted to sleep and in my head I thought it would be easier to just lie there and let him do what he wanted, hoping he’d finish soon. As soon as I woke up the next day I ordered a taxi home and he tried to kiss me and ask to see me again to which I replied no. I had a gut feeling that what had happened was not right and I remember expressing to my friends in vague terms about how the situation had left me feeling violated and pressured. I lacked the education on consent and sexual assault to see the situation for what it was: rape. I was subconsciously blaming myself thinking oh but you did go to his house and you did kiss him and you didn’t push him off when he started again after you’d said no. But the fact is I was coerced and I had said no, outright, MULTIPLE times and was half asleep when he decided to non-consensually touch me again and enter me. Only years later have I come to terms with the fact that I was raped and it’s been a confusing, painful and difficult process. I know now that just because I had stopped saying no does NOT mean that I said yes and gave my consent. Silence does NOT equal consent. Even if I had said yes, that yes would’ve been coerced by this point and invalid due to the fact I was intoxicated. My situation felt quite murky and blurred to me because of my lacking education on consent and what counts as rape and it took confiding in people I trusted and them validating my experience for me, as well as doing my own research about sexual violence, to fully accept I was raped. I think at the time it was easier to just not think about it too much and forget about it than to delve too deeply into what had happened, but now I’ve had to deal with those emotions and live the experience afresh which has brought up some complicated emotions and feelings. I tried to report it to the police to see what could be done legally but I was told it would be a case of my word against his, with a male police officer actually saying to me that ‘hopefully you can learn from this experience and not put yourself in that situation again’. I do wish I had known more about consent and had protected myself better but more than that, I wish men just didn’t rape. I wish men were educated on consent and rape culture. I wish their mates would call out their sexist jokes and predatory behaviour. I wish women weren’t victim blamed. I wish women were believed and taken seriously. I wish this was seen as not a women’s issue, but a MEN’S one. I am so tired and scared for all my women and the onus should NOT be on us. Men, sort yourselves out.",,
i was 14 drunk on a trampoline with this boy who I was friends with. we kissed and then I fell asleep or blacked out. i remember opening my eyes and seeing his hand squeezing my bare boob.,,
"I was walking home one night with friends and this 30 year old man started following us, shouting at us to stop and talk to him and grabbing me by the waist. He kept putting his hands under my jacket and feeling me up. We kept shrugging him off but he continued following. He then grabbed me by the neck and strangled me. Many adults saw us trying to get away and didn’t step in to help. He then rang up his fiends saying he’s “found some girls”. We then ran away and he stopped following.",,
"When I was in primary school boys would run up to me and my friends and chase my friends around and try to hump us. One even had a ‘rape lair’. This was all in the playground, out of view, and none of the teachers watching over us would do anything.",,
I was drugged and raped by a boy I trusted. I left his house screaming and crying barely gathering my things together. No one tells you what to do or who to go to. Protecting children turns into a “it won’t happen to me mentality” which makes it all the more damaging when it does happen as you feel alone and you are left blaming yourself. To this day I still feel ashamed. He texted me after asking if I wanted to meet him again - as if my screams and my “No’s” and my tears hadn’t even registered in his mind. He knew what he was doing but he didn’t seem to know it was rape.,,
"We were with a massive group of friends watching a film, i was sitting next to him and i felt his hand on my thigh, he started travelling up my top to my boobs with his other hand now on my thigh moving inwards i kept shrugging him off but he kept persisting and saying it’s okay were friends, i felt so frozen and scared of making a scene in front of my friends and of being called a liar or a drama queen. i didn’t realise how wrong this was of him my body felt violated - this wasn’t the only time this happened with the same boy and all of his friends do the same thing to many other girls regularly and they are never called out on it. i am sick of it. he made me second guess my feelings and only now, over a year later, am i realising i was silenced by him and i lost the rights to my body.",,
"I was sexually abused twice. The first time it happened I was still a virgin. I was 15 and he was two years older. I told him no, I said I didn’t want to and he didn’t listen. Afterwards I told him, “I didn’t want to do that”, and he laughed at me. To have my virginity taken away in such an aggressive and non-consensual way was really difficult to deal with. I felt dirty and kept questioning whether I was the issue, whether it was me that I had led him on. I still think about this and question myself all the time.,The second time I was on skiing holiday with my parents. I met him at a bar that I was at with my parents and he asked me to come back to his hotel to have dinner with his family, so I accepted. He said he needed to get changed and so I went with him to his hotel room where I would wait for him to do so. Instead of getting changed, he anally rapped me. I cried the whole time and eventually said to him that if he was going to do it he could at least hold my hand. After it had finished a male family member walked in and they joked about me being a slag and about him having his turn. I ran so fast back to the apartment I was staying in with my parents, I cried so, so much. And then I blamed it on myself and said it wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t a size 12 and so I developed bulimia and then anorexia to deal with the pain of it, blaming it all on my weight.",,
Story of the first time I was flashed. I was walking home from school at around 4:30. I was 12 or 13 and I was walking home alone the way I always go. I started walking down this street that had a bend in it and as I turned there was a man with his dick out. I looked away and didn’t think much of it and went home and jokingly told my mum. She explained that it was illegal and I had a conversation with a police women as he was erect meaning they suspected he might have just raped or assaulted someone. It made me feel disgusting and even though i wasn’t hurt or touched it made me struggle to fall asleep and made me not want to go to school as I would have to walk down that road. I am so sorry to any girls that has happened to and even if it feels like not a big deal it still shouldn’t be happening. I hate how young I was in this story and how even at such a young age it almost felt normal.,,
"During my lunch break one day in year 10 (14 years old), I entered a classroom with about 10 guys and 10 of my girl friends. One of the boys came over, slid his hand up my skirt and said ‘I want to touch your pussy’ as I pleaded with him to stop. All the boys laughed and I felt so humiliated. This wasn’t the first inappropriate thing this boy had done so I reported it. I felt so shamed and guilty for reporting it from my girl friends reactions that I ended up apologising to this guy. At a house party a couple of years later, he followed me into a bathroom, locked the door and came towards me. I backed into a corner again pleading for him to leave and he smiled and then left. ,At another house party, I had too much to drink and heard a guy in my year asking everyone if he should ‘tea bag’ me as I lay ill on the sofa. Luckily I had enough strength to get up and push him away.,The lack of sex education at my school definitely contributed to this lack of knowledge on consent, sexual harassment and abuse.",,
"When I was about 8 or 9 many of my cousins would touch me and made me touch them because they would say so. Especially this one old cousin who was like 18. I didnt really know what I was doing or what was happening at the time because I was too young to even understand. Now that I think about all that and look back at it disgusts me and I still cant get over it. I have nightmares about it, anxiety attacks and im even scared to be alone in a room with a guy because I get those flashbacks and get scared itll all happen again. I hat the fact that they always mention him as the good guy in the family yet he ruined me. Sometimes I feel like its my fault for never relling anybody. Im really sorry for anyone who had to go through any type of assault or pain ;(",,
"I was sexually assaulted and raped numerous times by boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The rape culture at school was so bad that I didn’t even understand that it was truly sexual assault/ rape until I told my current boyfriend about my sexual experiences at school 3 years after leaving.,Both girls and boys would slut shame everyone so badly, particularly when we were all 14-16. I’ve been in a number of situations where I’ve been undressed and groped when I’ve either been asleep or have explicitly only said no. The fact that I had to deal with such backlash and bitchy behaviour from some of my less good ‘friends’ at the time meant that I completely blamed myself for circumstances out of my control.,The slut shaming culture at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] contributed to the rape culture more than people think- how can you stand up for yourself and realise that what happened when you were literally unconscious/ consent was verbally denies wasn’t your fault when people would just bitch about you and say you were embarrassed?",,
"I don’t really know if it counts as SA, but it has been in my head every since it happened. We were both around 4-5 years old. It was nap time in pre-k4 and he touched unbuttoned my pants and touched me. So I am not sure if it’s SA. It bugs me that I don’t know.",,
"I had a group of boys in my year that liked to talk about my body a lot in first and second year. Due to me being more mature body wise i just assumed this was normal. As i got older they took it upon themselves to touch me inappropriately whenever they felt like it which made me not want to be in school. Eventually some backed off but there was one boy in particular who would follow me out of class into the toilets and try and assault me. It got really bad to the point where he ended up following me out of school too and he tried to rape me behind the school. I was lucky and got away, i also told the school about this and was told there’s nothing they could do.",,
When I was 15 I had been out drinking and went to sleep and woke up to my ex boyfriend raping me. I told him to stop but he did not. I was so ashamed I would not be believed and would be blamed so never reported it. It has caused me a great deal of distress for years. I have recently took the brave step of reporting it to the police and have learnt that he did the same thing to someone else a couple years later.,,
"my experience was a couple of years ago now but i have so much guilt and regret. i was 15 and he was my boyfriend. i loved him so much and i alway wanted to do anything to make him happy i needed his validation, i was with him for 2 years from 14-16 and in that time i had consenting sex with him on hundreds of occasions, on one occasion i was at his house (we had already had consensual sex with him several times that day) but i was sore and hurting as he tented to like quite aggressive sex and i said to him i didn’t want to have sex again that day as i felt uncomfortable and weird, he proceeded to hold me down as i said NO multiple times and raped me as i cried my eyes out. afterwards i felt disgusting . from this moment onwards he seemed to develop a rape kink and the boundaries in our relationship sexually became very blurred but i needed his validation so bad i went along with all of his sick fantasies, which i have so much regret over as in my infatuation with him i almost validated him in his sick idea of what sex is. i have really been struggling recently with my story and my regret as recently other girls that he has been with since me have come out about there own experience with me, i only ever told a few people about my experience and never wanted to share it because i never thought it would happen to others but now i feel like it my fault and if i had told people at the time maybe the same thing would never happen to those girls. and to those girls i apologise greatly i feel awful and i am so sorry i wasn’t strong enough to say anything and i am so sorry for what happened to you.",,
i was 3 when i started getting sexual assluted by my brother dad it stop after a year when I was 8 I was sexual assluted by a family friend 9-10 I was sexual assaulted by my own cousin and at the age of 13 i went through sexual harassment by one of my classmates going back to class I told him to stop but ke keep on doing it I pushed him and yelled but got in trouble for pushing another student and being loud,,
Slap ass Friday and the fire truck game we’re very popular at my school. I’ve always hated it. One time a boy went way to far and ended up r@ping me. It was very traumatic and nobody in my life believed me. This boy has went on to rape 12 more people and has had little to no consequences.,,
"I was out clubbing once night when I was 16 and a guy I knew quite well (I’d been with him before) and I ended up going to the same after’s. We’d kissed in the club but we hadn’t spoken in months, so I told him numerous times (probably about 7) that we weren’t going to have sex, to which he responded each time with “we’ll see.” Back at the after party, we were making out on the sofa but I’d made it clear as anything that nothing else would happen. Without me realising, he’d moved my skirt and suddenly I felt him inside of me. I looked at him shocked and said I told you no?? and he responded with “you’re fine now it’s started though, it’s fine”. I jumped off the sofa and slept elsewhere. I didn’t realise until later that I was raped.",,
Last night I agreed to go see a movie with someone I had met online. Never talked to him on the phone or anything. He said it was just a movie but when we got there he wouldn’t stop touching me. I would push his hand away or even tell him stop. When I got home that night I got in the shower and broke down. I don’t know what to do.,,
"One of the boys I was close to a few years ago showed me a group chat with 100s of girls nudes on, I was so disgusted and tried to get him to delete it. He called it his ‘wank bank’ and told me that all the boys would circulate these photos of girls around. And even if he were to delete them, the photos had already gone around most of the boys.",,
"When I was 15, I was stalked for several months by a man in his mid-20. The harassment began one morning after the man noticed me at the bus stop I used every day to get to school; I was in my school uniform. From that I point, I was followed every time I left the house - at the shops, when walking my dog or hanging out with my then boyfriend. After I refused to interact with him, he began to get very angry and would shout abusive language at me saying I had 'led him on'. My boyfriend and sister began to receive messages on social media to say they couldn't stop him and we would be together. One day, he turned up at my school and delivered flowers with a note. The receptionist unthinkingly brought them to me in the middle of a French lesson. I burst into tears and told my teachers what was happening - I was being harassed and I was terrified of walking home. I gave a statement to the police and the man received a caution - he stopped following me, but nothing further happened. He lived locally and I still saw him on occasion until I moved away from the area.",,
I was sexually assaulted bu an eighth grader at an after school field trip I was sitting next to him at a jazz performance and he placed his hand on my thigh. I told him that I was uncomfortable and that I didn’t want him to touch in an area that was so close to my private part. He then said to me that it was ok because he wanted to touch me. When the person who was performing finished one of their songs I got up to clap and moved to a seat far away from him. After that night I’ve grown to hate myself and my body for what had happened to me.,,
"Everyone had an ambassador or uni friend, a person that took new freshers under their wing. Mine was a very attractive, confident guy. One day he invited me back to an exclusive party in the dorms. I couldn't believe he was interested in me. I got there and there were loads of people drinking having a good time. But it all felt wierd then I realised I was the only female. He was chatting to me about my course, law, and wanted to show me some of his essays. Took me back to his room. I didnt think much about it as there were loads of people there. We got to his room he closed the door pushed me on the bed and started kissing me. I was thinking omg what is happening. Then he pulled his pants down and mine. He told me I had to give him a blow job. I said no. He jumped on top of me held me down. I started shouting and screaming while he rubbed his erect penis against me. He told me to shut up and called me a tease and a slut. He eventually let me go because I would stop screaming. I ran out of there pulling my leggings up as I ran. I later found out he was dating someone on my course. She called me a liar and worse. She was completely different to me skinny, blonde ect. No one believed someone like him would be ""interested"" in me let alone do that. I was in a dark place and didn't even consider reporting it. I wish I could say this was the first instance of something like that happening but I can't but it is the first time I screamed and managed to get out. I saw no support from my uni around this, there was nothing sign posted. I didnt even know who I could talk to if I wanted to. I spent my whole uni experience drunk and on antidepressants. I got therapy for that and all my past experiences and despite those experiences I am here and I am fighting for change. I have now joined an organisation with institutionalised misogyny and face it every day. I will bring the change, I will be part of the change.",,
"Me and this boy were hanging out and swimming one day. We started kissing and he was touching on me and I was super uncomfortable. Do I asked if we could stop and we did for a little bit. But later on he was like “can I touch your boobs”. I said no and he did it anyways. He stuck his hand up my shirt and under my bra and touched me. Many people are like well it not that big of a deal atleast he didn’t rape you but it has damaged me mentally. He bragged about it to his friends and said he did more things and when I try and stand up for myself and say it didn’t happen I get told i’m a slut, whore, trying to lie so I make the bit seem like a bad person. And it’s mentally draining. I can’t even look at myself the same. We have to stop normalizing “boys being boys” because it’s still assault or could possibly be rape at the end of the day. Just because it a boy doing it and not a women shouldn’t mean they get a free pass. It’s still wrong.",,
"During my time at this school I have been subjected to an awful experience. I was unfortunately in school group chats where men were talking about how women were only useful for swallowing and should be used as such. I was playing a few games when people began to get insulted about whether they were ‘fuckable’ or pretty at all, myself receiving disgusting comments and falling into a dark place as such. While at my time at this school I was also assaulted by another student and when mentioned to the school as a safety concern I was met with disdain and nothing was ever done to help me and I was in fact made to feel like I was worth absolutely nothing.",,
My ex boyfriend met up with me at a lake and we was relaxing until he forced himself on me and that’s all I can remember,,
I was touched inappropriately when I was young by my step brother multiple times and he also made ne touch hum too but at the time I just thought it was normal but now I've grew to know that it wasn't okay,,
"I had just turned 18 and started going out to the local nightclub in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I met a boy there who was a university student, I was in the college and he wanted to go back to campus with me. We hit it off in the club so I said yes even though I was extremely nervous. I did not want to do anything with this boy and so when he got into my bed we didn’t do anything however, he put his hand down my trousers and cupped his hand over my Labia. Skin on skin. I tried to take his hand off and said no I don’t like that but he would not take his hand off me. He point blank refused to and I stayed awake for hours crying silently because he wouldn’t take his hand off of me. The next morning he didn’t want to get out of my bed but I started getting dressed straight away so he had no choice but to leave. I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life.",,
"Sexual coercion// He had come round to my house, we were linking at the time. I just wanted to watch a movie but he kept putting his hands down my pants- I pushed them off the first couple of times but it was clear to me he wasn’t going to give up. I told him I didn’t want to do anything more as I wasn’t in the mood but he kept on pushing it on me until I gave in. I thought he wouldn’t like me anymore if I didn’t give him what he wanted as he was starting to get angry at my resistance. I felt as thought because he was my link I was expected to fulfil him sexually. The more I thought about it the more I realised this was never okay and I wish more people had been taught more about sexual coercion at school so that people were aware of it happening to them and so that people could know that it isn’t ok (even though this should be a give)",,
"I got raped at 18 by a 40-50 year old man that drugged me. I never told anyone because I knew the blame would be put on me, I didn’t want to have to deal with people saying “yes, but what were you wearing”, “you should have been watching your drink” or “how much alcohol did you consume” we are in a male dominated world, my cry for help would have lead to me being criticised. Women are not the problem.",,
"I was once walking on the street with my friends after leaving a nightclub. Whilst walking, a guy ran up behind me, threw me over his shoulders and ran down the street with me. When he put me down, he asked how much he would have to pay me to have sex with him, and that nothing was too much as his ‘daddy’ is a rich business man. I said I didn’t want to and that I had a boyfriend, so I felt as if I had to call him as proof. The man then proceeded to shout on the phone to my boyfriend that he was “going to shove his c*ck down [my] throat”. Luckily, I rounded up my friends and we got a taxi safely home but the whole experience still haunts me.",,
"I was raped at 16. I went to a house party with my friends, a couple of hours in and I realised I had drank too much. I asked my friend hosting the party if I could sleep in his bed for a little while to sober up, my friend said yes and led me to the room & left me alone. A short while, another boy which I knew from school came into the room with me, he said he was drunk as well and was happy to sleep next to me. I was too drunk to argue against this, he then started to touch my legs and then asked for me to perform oral sex. My body felt numb and I didn’t fight back nor did I consent, he then proceeded to pull down my trousers and began having sex with me. I kept thinking at that moment that this isn’t really happening and I’ll wake up from a bad dream. After what felt like an eternity the party was stopped by parents coming home, one of the parents came into the room and asked us both to leave. I was in tears and ashamed, I told my friends what happened and they laughed and said I was embarrassing to ever want to sleep with someone like that. For the rest of my final school year I was called my rapists name instead of my own as a “joke”. I am now 22 and it still traumatises me to this day.",,
"my freshman year, i was sexually harassed by a classmate in my art class almost everyday. i never said anything because i felt like they wouldn’t do anything without proof.",,

"In the summer I was hanging out with a good friend of mine and two boys, one of the boys was dating my friends. We had gone to one of the boys house and we all got really drunk played drinking games, I thought I could trust all the people in the room as they attended same school as me and I have known them for years. I told the girl whom was my friend I wanted to go home as I was feeling dizzy and was beginning to black out. She told me to wait inside the house and as I waited she had disappeared with her boyfriend and it was only me and this boy in this room I asked him to get me a cab but all I remeber was him taking me to his room and that was all I can recall of that night . I have no idea how I got home and when but what I do know I got home and I had no underwear and I never took it off. The next day I went on holiday and the boy insisted that I would buy the contraceptive pill and I asked him why as I had never given any consent to do anything. He told me to get the pill and send a video of me taking it and said that it wasn’t a big deal these things happen at parties and that he was drunk too. I just couldn’t believe that someone could take advantage of someone they were supposed to be friends with.",,
"At my school [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], for years, would organise a “full birch” in which they would wait till dark to run around the school specifically targeting the girls houses chanting ‘[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is a school for boys’ in retaliation to girls joining the school in 2005. I remember being 13 and genuinely terrified that the boys running around in masks with loud music outside my window as I sat watching in my pyjamas were going to come and hurt me. Everyone treats it as a joke and in some ways it’s harmless, but it’s just a small example of the blatant misogyny which has been allowed at this school from the boys by the staff.",,
"I went to a party, got so drunk I blacked out and threw up. When I woke a guy took me into the bathroom and we had sex, I asked him to stop and he told me to wait.",,
i was black out drunk first time drinking and i drank way too much found out the next morning i did something with someone i didn’t want to do apparently i wasn’t even conscious,,
I was sleeping and I woke up with him touching my Private area,,
"The culture at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is disgusting. I have been groped in chemistry lessons and lunch queues. Boys have no qualms about discussing girls bodies and their sexual prowess in front of their faces. I have sat there whilst boys shared girls nudes on group chats and around the class. Offensive nicknames and ratings of girls body parts are extremely common. Boys will loudly discuss a girl’s sexual activity in the middle of class and openly harass and shame her. multiple boys in my year have tried to coerce me into sending nudes, making me feel guilty when i refused, calling me boring and later slut shaming me for my outfits.",,
"When I was in year 8 (12-13 years old), I started spending time with a boy at school who seemed really nice - we always got along and had a good laugh in lessons. Our school was a fair distance from where we lived so we always got the bus. One day we'd been hanging out, and on the way home on the bus (which was completely empty on the upper deck) he started grabbing me and trying to kiss me. I kept telling him no and pushing him away, but he carried on putting his mouth on me, and his braces scratched my gums. He then put his hand between my legs and started rubbing really hard on my vulva, and I kept trying to pull his hand away and push him away but he just kept holding on. Luckily we got to his bus stop 5 minutes or so later, so he stopped and got off the bus and acted like nothing had happened. I just started crying when he left and I felt so dirty. I'd never done anything like that with anyone before, because I never wanted to. He tried to message me later apologising and even his brother messaged saying he didn't mean it, but if he knew it was wrong then why did he do it in the first place? That boy is now a teacher so I hope his attitude to women and consent is better.",,
"Last year on Halloween I went clubbing and got separated from my friends. I was completely intoxicated and so decided it would be safer to call a cab, rather than drunkenly stumble round the club. In the cab, on the way home, I was assaulted by the driver. He forced me down on him, whilst putting his hands down my trousers. He then put his number into my phone and said he’d be calling me tomorrow, before dropping me at my halls. I never reported him, I was too scared that no one would believe me because I was so drunk.",,
Several male teachers have made girls feel uncomfortable in the way that they present themselves. Some of them deal with situations in a bad way and completely sexualise the idea of skirts and on some occasions have looked up or directly at skirts when speaking to us,,
"When I was 17 I was sexually assaulted by a guy in my friendship circle (different school), whom others have wrote in about. In a midst of self-blame for going to his house, I didn’t ask my friends to pick sides at the time. I had amazing friends and siblings to help me through it. I urge every girl to come forward, it can affect you long-term if you don’t speak to anyone about it.",,
"I was 15 and it was the first time i’d been seeing a boy. I had my first kiss with him and he made me feel nice about myself. We hung out quite a few times and then he came around my house. Everything was fine then he kept getting pushy and trying to do things to me, but I trusted him and so further consented to it. During it he then proceeded to take a video of it which made me unbelievably uncomfy (bear in mind this was my first time having sex and i was only 15) and I got him to delete it from his camera roll & recently deleted but didn’t realise it was saved on his snapchat memories. He got home that night and sent it to some of his friends. We had mutual friends and none of them even thought to tell me that he recorded it until a week after it had happened. The whole experience has traumatised me and left me with unbelievable trust issues, yet he gets to go on with his life not feeling the disgust i feel for my own body.",,
The first it happened I was 13 and it was my boyfriend. I didn’t think i was sexually assaulted back then but I had the time to think about it and I had people tell me that it was. He would touch me in places I didn’t want to be touched and I tried to move his hand but I wasn’t strong enough to do it. I can still feel his hands on me and it’s been 3 years since. It happened again when I was 13 but it was with a different guy. I wasn’t dating or anything I was just friends with him. He would rub his head on my boobs every time I went to hug him and I was so scared of him so I didn’t say stop or anything. The last time it happened was my freshman year. It was with this guy I liked so much. He was kissing me and I kissed him back but he started touching me in places and I kept moving his hand but he put them back and I was so scared of what would’ve happened if I said something. This is my story and I’m sorry for anyone who has dealt with stuff like this 💗,,
"I was 12 years old and I had just moved to the US from Mexico. I was struggling to learn the language. A family member would touch my legs when I visited my aunts house, and one day no one was home and he was giving me a “massage” and his hand started to go more down towards my breast. I moved quickly and started running away from the house and he was yelling like he was scared and trying to pretend he didn’t touch me. I felt so powerless and later I mentioned it to his sister and she defended him. I told the police at some point but I didn’t want to break my family apart so to this day my parents don’t know. And I still see him at family events and my blood starts boiling, he ended up marrying a half cousin of us from Mexico. It was so painful writing this testimony.",,
"the summer I had just turned 16 my ex boyfriend’s best friend sexually assaulted me at a party. I was quite drunk and already half asleep, but he came in asking to sleep next to me because someone had taken his original sleeping spot. Immediately after he proceeded to try and turn me to face him and shoved his hands down my trousers. I was mortified the entire time and just wanted it to end. I managed to find the courage to tell him to stop before he managed to do anything",,
Extremely sexual jokes are being made about me by a person I’ve never met. They talk about blow jobs and make sexual movements to accompany these jokes. Teachers have said multiple times to my brother (who these jokes were being told to) that they would sort it and do something about it and yet this student still has not suffered any of the consequences. It’s absolutely disgusting I feel violated beyond belief and absolutely petrified that they are going to act on these jokes. I don’t feel safe anymore.,,
"I was about 10 years old walking home from my music lesson alone (a few mins walk). Broad daylight, I think I was wearing my primary school uniform, not that it should matter. He was in a big Land Rover like car with the side door open, parked mere strides away from my house. I glanced in as I walked past and looked him fully in the eye. I then realised he was stroking his openly exposed penis, and must have been the whole time i was walking down the street. I had never seen one before, and I didn’t understand what he was doing, although I felt it was wrong. I didn’t tell anyone for nearly 10 years, and even now i’ve only told a few. It’s not sexual assault per se, but it messed with my perception of sexuality for a long time.",,
"During my first week of sixth form at school, I was waiting to go into my chemistry lesson. A younger boy in uniform (probably around 15) intentionally pushed his friend into me and he held out his hands to cup my breasts. He squeezed my chest. Another girl in my class told my teacher and the younger boy was reported. I was told by another teacher not to pursue it as the boy was younger.",,
"I drove around with two guys one night and we smoked. The guy in the passenger seat got out of the car to run into the store and I was alone with the driver. He told me to jump into the front seat so he didn’t have to turn all the way around to talk to me. After I got in the front seat the passenger got back in the car and took the back seat. We went to the liquor store and the guy that was now in the backseat ran in to get a fifth for us to share. While he was in there, the driver started rubbing my thigh and I flinched, but he continued to rub my leg. After drinking the fifth they dropped me off at my friends house. The next day, the driver texted me and we pretty much arranged a time to hook up. He took me to an apartment parking lot in the middle of the day. I said I was uncomfortable having sex in this setting and after a lot of pressure I ended up just giving him head. After all of that he started texting my best friend harassing her about it and using the fact that I gave him head, as a way to pressure her into doing it. When I blocked him on snap, he found my number and began harassing me and calling me a bitch, and ugly. He then blocked my number and periodically contacts my best friend to call me a whore.",,
"When I was nine years old, another child grabbed my ass when I refused to be his friend's girlfriend. He meant it playfully but I felt disgusting and ashamed of myself for the rest of the day. We were both prepubescent. It had nothing to do with sexual urges and everything to do with learned behaviour. Ten years later, my younger sister - at eight years old - is inappropriately touched by a boy her age.",,
"There was one boy at my year at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who sexually assaulted many girls in our year at lots every party. It happened to probably around 25 girls out of a cohort of 50ish girls to demonstrate the extent of the issue. It was passed off with him being ‘drunk’ and despite the huge turmoil that happened as a result with all the girls coming together absolutely furious, the school did nothing and he just continued along the same path.",,
"When I was 12 I was at prep school and I was boarding to get used to it before I went to my next school. We had a new teacher who was working as one of the boarding staff, he was generally very nice to everyone and taught the younger years during the day. But at night when ever he could catch me alone he would feel me up or ‘tickle me’ while actually trying to touch my chest (I was 12 so I don’t know what he was trying to grab), but one day he slipped up and my friend saw him groping me, he immediately stopped and I started walking upstairs. She was obviously concerned and asked me about it and I told her, she then bought me to my friends room where there was 5 of our other friends hugging my other friend. The girl who witnessed it happen to me asked if I could tell them what happened, so I did. Immediately the girl who was being hugged told me the same thing had been happening to her. Everyone was saying we should tell another teacher but I was terrified that I would get in trouble because he’s a teacher after all. So I said no. Long story short they told the teacher anyway with the other girl and I got called in. It all went to police, the witness had to give her statement and we got interviewed a bunch of times. But due to insufficient evidence, the case was dismissed. He was fired from teaching at the school though. But the damage it did to my mental health still hasn’t really gone away as it was implanted in me from so young...",,
a male teacher touching my bum and chest area and then when i hit his hand he sent me out and was trying to pin me up against the wall,,
"This will forever disturb me and it’s been something I’ve been thinking about recently. A boy in my year (year 12) sent flowers to a girl in the youngest year of school (year 9) and it definitely stood out among students who had heard about it as strange and it wasn’t common for people at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] three years apart to date. What made it feel a lot weirder was that, alike a lot of girls that age, she hadn’t developed yet and honestly looked a lot younger than her age. Not that it would make it any less predatory for a sixth former to be trying to engage romantically with a first year if she looked older, but the fact she looked so so young did add to the layer of weirdness. After that, a friend of mine noticed he followed an array of child modelling accounts and child pageant accounts. These accounts aren’t child pornography accounts but I don’t think it can be denied that their is something deeply disturbing and very abnormal about a 17 year old boy wanting to engage with the accounts. The friend took this information to the school only to be told they can’t be going on a “witch hint” and apparently his house master spoke to him about it in a very light hearted and joking manner about the accounts he followed but nothing really came of it. Im not claiming this boy every hurt a child, I couldn’t say that as a fact. I just wish it was looked into further and that perhaps the boy received some sort of therapy to prevent any children from being hurt. This was years ago and we’ve left school now but what upsets me is that the other day I found his instagram profile and he still follows these same child modelling and pageant accounts. It worries me that he’s a potentially dangerous person who will go on to hurt someone and that if the school took these warning signs seriously, maybe that could be prevented.",,
"I have never received any education about sexual harassment , yet i get loads of boys making comments which sexually objectify me and people I know . i have been threatened to send nudes and to have sex with someone . The teachers don't do anything and its getting worse by the day , no one listens to us as feminists anymore because of other reasons or situations that may come up.",,
"I was really drunk at a club and went home with a boy. I don’t remember anything. I woke up naked in his bed, he had sex with me whilst I was unconscious.",,
"I went out clubbing last year and lost all of my friends. I didn’t know this boy but he started buying me drinks and saying “I hope you’re not one of those girls who gets the guy to pay for their drink and runs away” so I felt like I had to say. I don’t remember how I got home or even bringing him back to mine. Next thing I remember is waking up in bed naked next to him, I can only assume what happened. After waking up, he tried to have sex again and I said no. It still happened. He started even though I didn’t want him to, stopped half way through to look for lube because of course I wasn’t prepared for sex, couldn’t find any so just carried on. It took me 4 months to even realise it was rape, and the realisation that was triggered because I saw him again and he pressured me into doing other stuff which brought up the memory I’d blocked out.",,
I was passing out drunk and this boy in my year wouldn’t get off me. He tricked me into kissing him multiple times and took off my trousers while I was passed out. He kept me pinned down on the sofa so that I couldn’t get up and leave. I felt too uncomfortable to ask for help.,,
"this happened exactly 24 hours ago. I’m not sure if ive fully processed it yet but this is a start. I was very drunk, and my boyfriend had gone home for the evening, and I was left with my best friend and my boyfriends best friend. His best mate hadn’t had anything to drink, he only had a few beers earlier in the evening and he was sober the time we left our mates house. My best friend went home. I was on the verge of blackout. My boyfriends best friend took me back to his house and made out with me for around two hours. He gave me a massive hickey on my neck. He touched my boobs and my ass multiple times and not once throughout this entire thing did he ask me if it was okay. When I woke up this morning I felt sick and not from the hangover. My boyfriend is my first love and he means the world to me, and his best friend has just taken advantage of me. I feel disgusting, violated and ashamed, and even though I’ve been told it wasn’t my fault, I still feel as if it is. I feel disgusting.",,
"i was only 15 when this happened. my boyfriend at the time made me fall in love with him innocently. a couple of months later he would start coercing me into having sex with him. “ you know you want to” “ don’t be boring “ you get the idea. this went on more than 10 times, i didn’t realise how bad it was. until it got worse. he would climb on top of me and rub me, he made me bleed. he ignoring me saying no he ignored me crying after and he ignored the blood he caused.",,
"I was 16 and was staying at a girl in my years house after a party, a few of us stayed over but there was one boy that I didn’t know at all there. I was very drunk so passed out on her sofa, I woke up in the night to the boy I’d never met or spoken to before trying finger me. I was able to push his hand away but he continued to try, I pushed him away probably 5/6 times, he wasn’t drunk at all. In the morning I told some of the girls staying over what he’d done but no one really reacted and I didn’t want to be slut-shamed as had already experienced this before (at only 16!!). He messaged in the morning apologising if he went too far, I blocked him and then was blamed by girls in my year for being rude and blocking him. This might not seem awful to some people but this has stayed with me years and years later.",,
We were in y10 and we were shown a video about consent. We were asked to sit down when we thought the girl couldn’t consent. Three boys didn’t sit down even at the end. They thought it was funny and basically said she deserved it because she was pissed. Nothing was said and those boys didn’t get spoken to. They thought it was funny.,,
Was at a party and was quite drunk. I was waiting for my friend who was upstairs with a guy and i was alone with this guy I’d only met that night. He would stand behind me pushed up against him with his arms around my waist. I tried moving and walking away to get him to stop but he wouldn’t. I told him to stop but he just laughed it off. I kept feeling him trying to turn my body around so that I’d be facing him and eventually I got tired of it and just got off with him.,,
"I was 14 and he was 17 he was and still is my brothers friend. The first time that he messaged me was when lockdown started and he started to become flirty with me. He started complimenting me on my body and how I looked. He eventually asked me for pictures and because I was young I was excited that an older boy was interested I did what he wanted. Until he’d ask me everyday and threaten to expose them if I ever said anything to anyone. And if I didn’t want to send he would get angry and saying horrible things to me. He’d manipulate me into thinking it was right when it was so wrong and making me feel like I was worthless, like I was nothing apart from my body. That summer he came round to see my brother and he constantly messaged me asking to meet him and give him head. He called me multiple times and kept talking to me to get me to go to a separate room with him. That night he tried to force me to leave my room and come and do things with him which I didn’t want to do. The next morning I was hesitant to leave my room incase I saw him and when I finally left he followed me to the kitchen and tried to close the door so it would be just me and him. When he left he hugged me and groped me multiples times. When he left I went to walk my dog and he messaged me multiple times saying he was going to find me in the park and take me somewhere to do things. I recently found out he had rape allegations and I am so scared that if he did find me that day something could of happened to me",,
"On one of my first lessons with my new biology teacher, he was telling us about his 2 daughters which we all thought was so sweet until he asked me to stand up and turn around so he could see if my figure was like his daughter. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal but iIve been to hardly any biology lessons since as he makes me so uncomfortable."",i was only 10."",Since then he decided that we’ve broken up and every once in a while he tries to invite me round his house when nobody else is home even when i do not respond to his messages. my experience with him made me scared to talk to people online and make new friends as i’m scared this experience will happen again.",,
"‘Friend zoning’ - not specifically an incident but I think it could be perceived as a wider part of rape culture/the expectation of sex and romance in exchange for being nice ? Personally the whole idea of friend zoning seems like a bit of a social construct to me as I don’t believe that anyone should expect something more from being nice to someone, which in my experience has been the case with lots of guys I know. Frequently myself and other girls I am friends with might develop a close friendship with a guy and in return he expects more than friendship, and a rejection of this by the girl is met with defensiveness, rudeness, ignoring, the friendship completely ending, harsh comments etc. Whilst I know it can happen both to guys and girls, I see guys more often take rejection way more personally, and assume that just by being nice they deserve something in return, and that if a girl is being nice to them she automatically wants something more with them - which is a huge problem as from what I can tell from these testimonies, many guys meet rejection with harassment and assault due to expectations of sex/sexual acts in return for being ‘nice’. Rejecting a friend in a romantic and/or sexual way is completely valid, and is not something that should provoke such violent and horrible reactions. Sometimes friendships are just that and should be left that way, and nobody should expect anything more from being nice to someone.",,
"Over the past two years I’ve done a lot of unlearning.,I’m writing out these stories now as a form of catharsis, because I don’t think I’ve fully told anyone all of these and how they’ve affected me. I’ve always minimised my experiences and compartmentalised.,It’s been so difficult for me to actually come to terms with calling the things that have happened to me sexual assault because they never felt “serious enough”. Moreover the racialised dimensions of it taught me to be grateful there was any attention coming my way in the first place. Now I realise the environment I was in where the social worth of girls was based almost entirely on how attractive the boys thought they were. Anything any of the more popular boys did was instantly forgiven and this disgusting hyper-masculine hyper-toxic culture of entitlement was completely normalised. In the “outside” world, I still had bad experiences with strangers who felt entitled to my body, my space and my time, so it only reaffirmed this.,This is a long read, and is undoubtedly uncomfortable but I think it’s so important to realise how prevalent assault is and how many different situations it can happen.,My first assault was when I was about 15 or 16 and relatively new to everything, I’d only ever kissed one guy before. I was at a friend’s party where she’d invited her family friend and his friends. One of them started the night off with refusing to call me by my name but instead by “common” ethnic names. Later in the evening when I’d had a lot to drink he sat by me and asked me if he could kiss me. I froze. And he took my silence as consent and shoved his tongue into my mouth. I tried to pull away but he held the back of my head and didn’t let go until a friend came into the room. It felt so wrong but I never had the vocabulary to explain why, because after all he’d asked me first hadn’t he?,Over the next few years I confused my attractiveness with male attention, and male attention with self worth. This was only made worse and reinforced by the racial aspects of desire where my distance from whiteness made me feel completely sidelined. I’m so sad now about how “grateful” I subconsciously thought I should feel for some of the unwanted attention I received.,The next incident was when I was 17. There was a guy who had expressed interest in me and I was excited because it was one of the few times something like that happened to me in my mostly white school. I ignored red flags, like when he told my friends he’d fuck me but he wouldn’t date me. He started seeing someone else so I didn’t think I had a chance until at a friend’s party where he told me he’d broken up with her. He lied, and it wasn’t until after he got with me that he immediately got with her again in front of me and THEN broke up with her. The worst part was after that when he tried to convince me to come upstairs with him by repeatedly kissing me WHILE I was telling him I didn’t want to and shoving his hands up my bodysuit to grope my boobs. He then tried to grab my arm to get me to go with him and left scratches. This was in a crowded room of dancing people who afterwards he told I was coming onto him the entire time. My male friends stayed friends with him and no one called him out for it because I was too in shock/embarrassed to speak up. It wasn’t until he groped three girls at another party that there were any kinds of repercussions but things went back to normal for him after a week. Even then, it was more because those girls were white and close with guys who were more popular than he was.,Next was in my first year of uni where there was a guy who, throughout the year repeatedly tried to get with me while we were drunk. At first, I was kind of into him and we got with each other once but I wasn’t interested in getting with him again. Then at an end of year party he approached me while I was in a conversation with a group of people, pressed a beer to my arm, then tried to kiss me - all without saying a word to me. He spent the rest of the night trying to convince me to get with him and at one point was kissing down my arm while his friend watched and didn’t say anything although I was visibly uncomfortable. Again in second year, while in a group convo with some mutual friends he abruptly kissed me without my consent. Both incidents were so embarrassing and degrading because he made me feel like my desires didn’t matter because I was a sexual object.,Last year I had a guy who I was friends with and was casually seeing slap me on the arse i front of our friends then loudly announce to a complete stranger how he’d hooked up with me the week before. This was all after I’d just had a conversation with him about treating me with respect.,Recently, I was walking home from uni in the afternoon and had a random man walking towards me lunge at me to try and hold me, and caressing my leg in the process. It was terrifying because even though I’d had so many bad experiences in the past, I didn’t think something like that could happen in broad daylight. I sometimes still feel nervous whenever men walk past me on the street. I’ve also had strangers corner me in uncomfortable and sometimes overtly suggestive conversations.,I’m so relieved for this platform making me realise that I wasn’t alone in this and my experiences are valid.",,
this boy goes to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and before i rly liked him and he knew this so wen this one night came wen he sent abs which isnt even a big deal but then he kept on ab me sending him nudes until i did. he promised he wldnt ss and he knew how concious i wos ab my body but he ss anyway and led me to believe he hadnt and i trusted him - until months later he joked about how he had my nudes w his friends and that i didnt even know i started crying and he still didnt delete them and instead made it sound like a compliment that he ss to justify his actions. anyway later on he forced another boy to slap my arse in front of many many ppl which left me powerless and hurt that my good friend that i told sm shit too humiliated me time after time,,

I lost my virginity to a guy who wouldn’t stop asking after he got me so high I wasn’t sure how I felt. He kept asking me over and over and I wasn’t in the right mind to make a decision but he kept asking and pressuring so I just gave in. Later he got more abusive and sometimes wouldn’t listen to me when I asked him to stop or said no. I then found out he has done similar things to other girls. This was a year and a bit ago.,,
"In class I was seated next to a bit who would often misbehave, with the hopes my quiet demeaner would be a good example for him.,He would often make rude or uncomfortable remarks. During one of the lessons, He began to masterbate and attempt to touch me whilst sat at the desk. I asked to move seats because I was incredibly uncomfortable however, the teacher decided to ignore this request..,I was unable to concentrate in class and felt ignored, disrespected and frankly, disgusted. I did not follow this up because I didn't know how to. It was very distressing and I felt like I had no authority over the situation. I wish there was space held for students in school to have a discussion and not be put in such positions."",Another lad at the school who i used to be friends with sexually assaulted me when we were out with friends. He walked off by himself and I went after him to see what was wrong when he kept asking me to kiss him and touch him. When i told him no he carried on and i felt awful. I should've gone back sooner but i kept going with him until we pulled me on to his lap in the woods and even after i moved and said no and that i didnt want to he still did it. He continued to touch me inappropriately and it was horrible. I left and told a few friends but most of them are still friends with him and some of them think im lying even after they saw messages from him apologising to me. He now has a gf and when she found out she told me not to go to the police. I still havent told any adults or reported it. I was 15 when it happened. Im 16 now",,
i’m 15 i was raped and sexually assaulted by a supposed friend,,
From the ages of 6 - 12 years old I was made touch and touched inappropriately by a guy the same age as me. Because I was so young and practically grew up with him doing this I didn’t think it was wrong although he made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. He also made sexual comments also about my body. I had to go through this for 6 years.,,
"I was sexually assaulted on school property in the middle of year 11. The school had been informed of one other assault by the same person prior to mine and told the girl they didn’t believe her. After that, we knew not to report things. I blamed myself for a long time as I knew to avoid him, but in the end there was no way I could get away. I underperformed massively in my GCSE’s and after I believed I’d never had to see him again, I reported the incident, and everything I knew, to the police but of course they did . I later dropped out of my sixth form when I found out he was also attending. I was told since he was in none of my lessons there was nothing they could do. He used to wait outside the front door every morning and stare at me as I walked in. My secondary school had a blatant disregard to its duty of care, seemingly with the hope that not acknowledging the issue would mean it wasn’t there. I’ve spoken to 4 other people assaulted by the same person as me, 3 on school property. Only the first reported it, and the way it was handled set a very heavy precedent for how we feared we’d be treated.",,
"During a sports day with the boys school all the girls had to wear skirts on top of their leggings, apparently the boys would get distracted by our bums and thighs. It could’ve been for our benefit, but it felt an awful more like they were shaming us.",,
"I was raped and physically abused by someone I trusted when I was young. I spoke out about him on social media in order to protect others and as a form of healing for myself. He is now taking me to court. The saddest part is how I felt so relieved speaking out about my experience and now I am seen as a criminal, for literally just telling my truth. I will continue to use my voice.",,
"I went out with a group of my friends. The guy that was there had grabbed me and touched me even after I told him I felt uncomfortable. He then continued to harass me after I told him no. He would threaten me and tell me that if I didn’t do what he wanted he would come to my house and hinted at raping me. I reported this to my school (with evidence of what he had said), they had not believed me. Once the police were involved my head of year told me that I should have kept it to myself. My head of year and head teacher did not care and it had been very clear when they let him back into the school after 7 other girls came out with sexual assault accusations against the same boy.",,
My ex boyfriend would screenshot my nudes when I would explicitly say not to or he would try to do it in a way I wouldn’t notice then when I would find out and ask him to delete it he would beg me over and over again to keep them until I would just give in and say yes or would just ignore me asking him to delete them. After we broke up I still don’t think he has deleted them.,,
I went to a party and I was really drunk. A boy took me out from the Marquee everyone was in and made me sit on him lap on a bench. I don’t remember anything and everything I know is because my friends told me that i looked uncomfortable. All i remember is that he kept grabbing my thigh and bum and I couldn’t say no. When I went home my mum noticed a hole in my tights by my inner thigh and I just told her i tripped over. i feel so gross even thinking about it. sorry i submitted before but i wanted to name the school,,
"My dad used to drug me and rape me when i was a kid. From when i was a few months apparently and until i was 5 my biological father used to drug me, drag me into his bedroom and almost take turns abusing and raping and touching both me and my mum... i could move but my eyes were wide open and i felt so helpless.",,
"I want to talk about the worst cases, things that have made me lose all trust in men. The first thing happened when I was 19 at a house party. I ended up going to an upstairs bedroom with a boy I was sort of seeing at the time and we ended up having sex. In the middle of us having sex, two of his friends came into the room and the boy I was with pinned me down with his body so I couldn’t move or cover myself up. I then found out a year later that one of the boys has taken a photo of us on the bed naked and had sent it to the boy I was sleeping with. I don’t know if he still has that photo or who else has seen it and it makes me feel sick to think about. Another time, I was on a night out at university I went home with a guy whilst quite drunk. I consented to the sex but then afterwards the boy told me that he had removed the condom halfway through and that I should “probably buy the morning after pill”. At the time I tried to shrug it off as nothing and bought the pill on my way home, but I didn’t feel right about it. A few months later talking to a friend about what happened he told me that what that boy had done constituted as rape. Every time I have any kind of sexual relations with anyone I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.",,
"A group of boys in the school will go round slapping their male friend's asses. This makes them very uncomfortable. Derogatory comments are usually made when this happens, and some of the harrassers will continue with this behaviour even when the friend has moved away from them the first time they did it.",,
"One night I was drunk and going home when I was taken by a middle aged man at 11 pm outside a train station in public with people around. I looked probably around 12 and he started kissing me and took me to a backalleyway where he fingered me and forced oral sex onto me. This was my home town, and I can never walk down there anymore. The shame that came and guilt and self blame from the expience meant I never shared the story till 5 years later. Not only this, the rape culture at my school was very bad, slut shaming, exposing private pictures, touching..the list goes on, at one point a video of me taken in year 8 was brought about in year 11 when my friend was threatened or else the video would be released. Thank you so much for everything you’re doing with the exposure - the 97% stat is very real and I see it greatly reflected in real society today.",,
"Out in town with my friends whilst I was in year 7, I went to cross the road. However I was stick behind some people and my friends had crossed before me but they waited at the other side of the crossing for me. As I was so small I was pushed the back of a crowd and was made to drop my bus pass, purse and bag oj the floor. As I picked my things up a man starting touching me inappropriately. He touched my bum and all the way between my jeans from my bum to the front of me (vagina). This happened in broad daylight in a town centre with loafs of people around however no one said anything and I don't think anyone even saw.",,
"i was with my best guy friend at the time and we were hanging out at his house after dinner. we were watching a movie and he kept putting his hand on my thigh. i got uncomfortable and kept shuffling away but didn’t want to say anything because he was still my friend. his hand then went way too far up my skirt and i jumped up and ran out of his house. this is only one of the times i’ve been in uncomfortable situations, let alone the times me or my friends have been catcalled while being in school uniform",,
I was sexually assaulted by a boy in my year on school grounds in [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. He put his hand up my skirt and people told me that he went around saying he would rape me.,,
For years i was sexually assaulted and pressured into doing things with someone who went to the same school as i did. It started in year 7 and continued throughout and if i tried to talk about nothing would happen. They the same person did it from when i was 7 until i was 15 then i was told i became stubborn for standing up for myself. Nothing was ever done.,,
"I must have been about 13 and this boy who sat next to me in English kept putting his hand between my legs moving up my thigh saying it was a game and that I would give up. He told all his friends I was the winner and they laughed. I'm autistic and so social cues weren't easy for me and I was very vulnerable to manipulation. I just realised 10 years later that it wasn't a game and he was exploiting me nearly 3 times a week for a year"",All throughout school girls were sexualised, from the years above and the years below. Walking down the corridor when there’s huge groups of people going to lessons and being groped/slapped on the arse was all too common. Nudes being sent around the school and nothing being done, especially when teachers heard people talking about it, nothing was done on their behalf like in my case. We had one teacher that has now been sent to prison for child sex offences! I firmly believe that that school broke me and now I’m 23 and still trying to build my life back.",,
I was out during Fresher’s Week in [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and started to gw a guy at one of the clubs. I was super drunk and he took my hand and we walked out the club. I wasn’t really aware what was happening and he said he was taking me to his flat which I said I didn’t want to do. I stupidly said to go to my flat instead and as soon as we got into my room he started taking my clothes off. I kept telling him to stop and he was trying to take my clothes off. I managed to push him off me so instead he undid his trousers and pulled me towards him and said ‘well if you won’t have sex you at least have to suck me off’. I stood my ground and pulled away and told him to finish himself off in the toilet which he did. While he was in the toilet I went out my room and spoke to one of my Flatmates but I was too embarrassed to tell him what had happened because how could I have been so stupid to bring him home. As soon as he was dressed I kicked him out and never saw him again but I also never told anyone what happened.,,
i was once at a party completely drunk and this boy persisted to gw me. i finally agreed just so he’d leave me alone (i was so drunk too stand up from where we were) he proceeded to put his hands down my trousers to try something and i told him to stop and he just continued and when i stood up and walked away he said “just allow it”,,
Many times I have had girls make unwanted comments about my penis in a sexual manor even when I told them to stop they kept doing it. I eventually reported them but they only got a lunch detention for doing it,,
"I was on the bus to school one day and a grown man was standing next to me. He started putting his hand up my skirt. I quickly noticed moved away from him and got off the bus at the next stop. For the rest of the day I felt an immense anxiety from what happened on the way to school. I was shocked because the man just seemed so normal, it was my daily routine, I was young and completely unsure what to do. Then I realised how this can happen to anyone at any time and no body would know. I have never told anyone this before because it makes me uncomfortable.",,
I was once at a party when I was about 16 and a boy in my year shoved me into a corner trying to kiss me after I repeatedly said no. He kept saying it’s a party it’s a party don’t be boring. I finally slipped away from him and ran to a close guy friend who I told what had happened. I asked him to help me get away from this guy and he responded ‘you’re drunk it’s fine’ and then left me alone. I had to see the guy every day at school after that and when I got visibly uncomfortable my friends told me I was being dramatic.,,
"I was 15, he was 17. I said no because I wasn’t feeling the best, and I really did not want to have sex with him. But he cried, persisted, and even made himself physically sick in order to make me feel bad because I had agreed the week prior. And I said yes because I hate making people feel bad and upset. I cried the entire time and he didn’t stop, he never stopped, he would stop when he was done.",,
I was in 5th grade when I was being touched and grabbed on my butt by this guy in class nobody cares I wanted to cry and end my life,,
"I am a guy and when I was at school, which is [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I was alone in the study room when a fellow student came in with a book in his hands and said I should read a part of it. When I went to look his penis was out on the book. He then shoved me on to the couch and gagged me. He then proceeded to pull down my trousers and start raping me. I am horrified and scarred to this day, even though I left last year to ok go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Thankfully in the few months I have been here there have been no incidents like this.",,
A guy at my school forced me to send him nudes on multiple occasions or he'd spread rumours about me he knew would ruin my life he would also send me unsolicited dick pics without my consent even when I had a boyfriend and wouldn't stop for 2 years he also on multiple occasions sexually assaulted me within school and touched me without my consent since I was forced to sit next to him in school within year 9 and 10 and I was too scared to speak up,,
"""Not a testimony but just an example of how low our standards are - the other day I had consensual sex with a man who was the first to a) ask me if I wanted to have sex b) use a condom c) make sure I got home safely after.,I am 22 years old - why is this still a surprise and not an expectation by this point??""",,
"i was 14 at the time and going on a date with my boyfriend, who was a couple years older than me, he made me feel specialit’s only recently i’ve been able to put together what happened and see the whole picture, and i realised he was pretending to be interested in me because i was younger. i liked him a lot so we went to the movies together then went walking into town. it was going really well until i started to feel really unsafe around him, and he was leading me into a shadier part of the town id never seen before - i live further away, and he was taking me down all these back alleys and eventually had me up against a wall and i couldn’t move, he was saying how he was going to make me do all of these sexual acts to him, but luckily somehow i wriggled out from under him and ran. i was so shaken up i couldn’t speak when someone asked what was wrong, i just shook my head. when we got back to school i was getting weird looks from everybody because hed told all his friends i had done stuff with him when i didn’t, and i lost most of my friends becuase of it.",,
I was manipulated into sending nudes. Everyone said you should’ve blocked them when I told them. Now I feel disappointed in myself and disgusted. No one mentioned the manipulation. I thought it was love,,
"This happened to me just recently. I’m 17 and it was Monday 6th September 2021. First day back to college and I was ready to go. Ready to step up and push myself to work hard. I was walking on the bus and asked to sit by people but they refused and I ended up sitting by a “normal guy.” First few minutes were fine then he started playing around with my foot with his as if he was trying to open my legs out for him. Then he kept staring pulling my hand to him and kept trying to get my body against his and everything. My heart was racing and I was scared. He literally put his hand on my thigh and slid it up and down my thigh in a caressing way. I pulled my thigh and body away from him but he just held on tight and pushed his hand into my inner thigh and I froze. I was just like why has nobody helped me. I got up and rushed to an empty seat. I sat there and cried silently to myself trying to get someone to help me. Nobody helped me until I got to college and cried my eyes out to my teacher. They just threw me around in different classrooms and I had to wait ages for some help. The police were involved but didn’t even get back to me till the end of that week. I was so scared of leaving the house that I made missing college and missing work a normal thing. Nobody cared to ask if I was okay or how I was. They just yelled at me for missing lessons and ‘jeprodisring my future.’ Still to this day, the police haven’t helped me. The college have let him back and I’m always scared to sit on the bus. Everyone telling me to ‘get over it’ I just wanna hit them because they don’t get what I’m feeling. Every day I’m reminded of it and I just feel so filthy and dirty all the time that even my cleansing showers don’t help. I just want someone to understand and listen rather than turn it back onto their lives.",,
"When I was 9 years old, me and my mother went out shopping. She asked me to get something quickly from a different shop. I left and told her that I'd hurry back and wouldn't take too long. I got what I needed and as I was about to leave the shop a few middle-aged men came up to me. They catcalled me saying things like ""Woah baby you look good"" ""What's the rush?"" ""Come with us sweetheart"" One of them came up to me and slapped my ass. I starting walking quicker trying to get away from them luckily they didn't follow me. I went back to my mum, but didn't tell her anything as I was young and still confused but now that I'm older I really wish that I'd have told her.",,
"From the age of 3 until I was around 15, I had been groomed and touched. By multiple family members, I spoke out once when I was 8 and my family called me names and cut all ties with me. I was a kid, and I was told that I was begging for it. At the age of 3, 7, and 10. I hadn’t known a thing about s*x and to tell a kid at that age those things hurt. To this day I can’t look at myself without feeling disgusting.",,
"He asked numerous times and every single time I repeated no and that I did not want to and I was not ready for it at all. He then ignored me for hours and told me he was going to leave me so I yes and cried for weeks after, no means no don’t EVER let someone belittle you and crush you and make you feel bad for saying no. YOUR body YOUR choice.",,
"On a university trip, a society committee member took a photo of me passed out half-naked on the floor. They shared it round their friends. I’d just been raped.",,
"My school would check every student leaving (all girl school) to make sure we weren’t leaving with a skirt that was too short or our pe skort that was usually short on most girls. They did this because they made it seem like it would attract unwanted attention from men and make us look like we were asking for it. My 11 year old self didnt see the issue in that moment but now looking back i was a CHILD and they made me and many other girls feel like we were at fault for men cat calling and sexually harassing us beacsue of our skirt length and it was so damaging. I understand this story isn’t necessarily trauma as a result of rape culture and the people coming forward with those stories are so so brave but i think this story shows how even at a school that doesn’t have boys that could say things to normalise rape culture, the staff manage to still normalise it being the girls fault and i think that it’s so wrong.",,
"This was quite recent and didn’t seem like that big of a deal at the time but I only very recently came to terms with the fact that what happened was assault. I was on a large amount of drugs so I don’t remember much and found myself sitting with a guy. At some point we started making out and I was fine with that but then later on he tried putting his hands up my skirt and in my knickers and I knew was very out of it and didn’t want to. I tried giving excuses that would maybe put him off doing it as well, as due to past experiences with rape and assault i struggled with saying no directly. however he still carried on trying and didn’t seem to care. the next thing i remember is that he was fingering me and i felt very strange and i could barely keep my eyes open and struggled to stay conscious at certain points but the same instinct kicked in as it had with my previous assaults, although this was less serious. in previous times they had instructed me to pretend i enjoyed it so they could finish so i thought if i did a similar thing he would think i was done and stop. it worked, he stopped eventually but i don’t know how long it went on and i just remember flashes of trying to say no and giving excuses which he kept ignoring, and then noticing at one point his friends were watching which made me feel very uncomfortable. I’ve been through worse and this didn’t affect me at all, but i think it’s very representative of how loose the concept of consent is, and how badly it’s taught at schools to young people. if it’s not a direct yes and clear verbal consent, you don’t continue trying to do something, especially if that person is not in a sober/clear state of mind and still trying to give excuses to get out of doing anything sexual or be touched in any way.",,
"i was raped, mentally and physically abused by my ex-boyfriend for almost a year.",,
"During my first term at uni, I experienced several encounters with boys which I later realised were not okay. I was coerced into having sex with someone. Despite saying I didn’t want to sleep with them several times, I was called a tease and made to feel guilty for wasting his time, as if I owed him something. After his relentless begging and touching, I gave in. On other occasions, people who I considered friends made me feel very uncomfortable. They ignored when I said no, and persisted despite my clear discomfort. It took me a while to realise what had happened, and I still find it difficult to talk about to anyone.",,
"It was around 8 in the morning at a motive which lasted all night (a family friends motive) my best friends brothers friend in which he invited started to try put his hands down my pants and slapping my bum really hard. I resisted his hands a couple times. I was 15 in year 10 and he was year 13 17/18. He then walked me over to a patch of grass and forced my head down to suck his dick. I was so scared and I had never even done it before. He then took me to a room with a mattress on the floor. After what had just happened I didn’t think it would get worse to quick. Moments later he ripped my clothes off and went straight into penetrating me. It happened all so quick. My brain froze and was inaudible to say anything. He made me do sexual things that I said no to and then proceeded to move my hand to places on him which I didn’t want to touch. And would whisper creepy and disturbing things to me in my ear. He had no protection on. There was no consent. I remember a point in which I felt so defeated, being on the ground flat with him pounding me, he tried to put it up my ass in which was so painful I flinched and he removed it and carried on beating me. There were moments he chocked me to points I couldn’t breath, and bit me, it was very aggressive throughout, let alone (tmi) but I wasn’t turned on so I found it painful the whole time. I eventually managed to escape the situation and ran away crying. I told myself for a couple weeks after that it was just a ‘bad beat’. I had people in his year laughing about how we fucked and knew about the sexual things he made me do, I was so embarrassed I stayed quiet and shook it off. Months later I started to realise what had happened was not okay and started to effect me so much. I hadn’t told any of my friends that what happened was rape. Since then till today there has never been a day in which I don’t think about it, constant flashbacks, struggling to focus at school etc you name it. This is my story and this took a lot for me to put it out there. It took me 8 months. I finally did it. And tbh I don’t think I ever would of until I saw that so many girls have had to go through uncomfortable and sexual interactions without consent, I felt less alone.",,
"Was sober at a party, a group of 4 guys who were under the influence circled me and forced me upstairs, than continued to rape me one after the other, watching each other.",,
In my 7th and 8th grade year a popular guy told people that i sucked him off and for those two years all of the boys would smack my ass and call me a slut and a whore. They would ask me how much I paid and if i could give them head or if they could just f*ck me. They always tried to look up my skirts too.,,
"I was 17 years old when I had my first 'boyfriend'. I didn't want to be with him, he forced me into a relationship using aggression and manipulation.After that he kept pestering me for sex, before we were together he knew I was asexual, yet pestering. I told him no for weeks until eventually I was so exhausted by his constant demanding that I gave in. It was painful, and I remember staring at the ceiling and pretending I was somewhere else while it happened.",,
a boy grabbed my breasts from behind and groped my butt. no one knows.,,
"When I was eighteen I visited a family member abroad, and we went out clubbing with her boyfriend and his flatmate. We had fun as a group and I ended up kissing his flatmate. We were staying the night at her boyfriend's flat, so I stayed in his friend's room. He immediately tried to continue kissing me and touching me, even though I repeatedly and firmly said no, that I didn't want to, I had changed my mind. I tried to leave the room but he apologised and said he would leave me alone, so I stayed. But he didn't, he continued to try and kiss me and touch me, even though I repeatedly said no. Eventually I gave in, as I just wanted him to stop and leave me alone, and he started having sex with me - but then reminded myself that I didn't want to so I started to say no again, and that I didn't want to. His first words after were ""But you said yes in the end, I didn't force you"". I felt dirty and ashamed that I felt like I had given in, even when I didn't want to and I had made that clear. I felt like it was my fault for putting myself in that position, and leading him on by kissing him earlier that night, and staying in his room. I waited until he fell asleep and then left the room and waited for my family member in the hallway until the morning. He then tried to follow me on social media after that and I blocked him on everything. I couldn't believe that he casually was trying to make contact with me after what had happened. It has taken me years to realise that this was not okay and that I was coerced, and that his actions were unacceptable. I have always felt as though it was my fault.",,
"""From about the ages of 9-14 I was sexually harassed/assaulted by a family friend who was three years older than me. Our parents are best friends so we would always go on holiday and would always be at each others houses. Every time we would see each other he would take me away from our families and start kissing and touching me in inappropriate places(eg fingering me or grabbing my bum or touching my boobs.),He would ask/force me to touch him/give him hand jobs and it was very obvious that I felt very uncomfortable with this as I would often say “let’s go back downstairs” or “I don’t want to do this” or “maybe later” but at the time I was so young/naive that it’s not until quite recently (I’m now 17) that I’ve realised how highly inappropriate this is, especially because it happened so many times & at the time I just felt like it would be weird if I didn’t do what he wanted because he had power over me (due to being very manipulative, older and male). This is why I didn’t mention it to anyone at the time because a) I thought it wasn’t a big deal, b) I didn’t want any of it to get in the way of our parents being best friends and c) I didn’t think anyone would believe me.,The fact I still remember certain moments so vividly such as on Christmas Eve when our parents were having a drinks party and he took me upstairs to my room and sexually assaulted me (by forcefully touching, kissing and fingering me at the age of 10/11) or when we were skiing and we were at a restaurant and he took me outside and sat me on his lap and started groping and humping me when I was 9 pretending we were playing a ‘driving game’ or when he was trying to make me give him a hj under a coat in the back of a taxi that his sister and my mum was in by grabbing my hand and forcing it on his dick and keeping his hand on mine whilst I did it shows how scarring it actually was despite not feeling like it was ‘that bad’ at the time and thinking it was ‘normal’ which looking back on it now is so sad because it definitely is NOT normal or acceptable behaviour. The older I got the more I stood up for myself and realised that this was not ok.""",,
"I was the last girl at a party when I was 13/14. It was one of my first few times drinking alcohol so I was completely disorientated and confused. I have blurred memories of the night, but I remember lying on the sofa and a group of boys surrounding me and touching me/ pushing me about. They forced me to dance with them whilst they touched me up and down. When I got up to leave, I was cornered by one of the guys who started feeling me up- grabbed my ass and placed my hand on his dick so I could see “how hard I made him”. Once the boys felt like they were done with me, they led me to the door and told me to leave. I could hear them laughing as the door slammed behind me. I ran out of house alone, afraid, disorientated and confused. I felt so much guilt and so much pain. I was left outside in an area I did not know, after something so horrendous and traumatic to get home alone.",,
"this isn’t a particular even but the sexualising of girls by [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys is the worst i have experienced. they pressure and trick girls into doing bits with them and sending them nudes so they can screenshot and put them on a big group chat to save. many of my friends and myself have felt sexually harassed by many of them on many occasions, being touched without our permission and being pressured to send nudes. there is also a massive amount of racism and homophobia there which the school turns a blind eye to. they believe they can get away with anything but shouldn’t be able to.",,
"It was year 10, we were on a school trip back from Germany. They had put us in alphabetical order on the flight for safety reasons, which meant I was surrounded by many of the boys. My friend was at the end of the register and was sat on the row opposite on her own. Part way through the flight the boys began to speak to me, saying horrible things about my younger sister in a gross sexual way, about me, their genitalia and when I threatened the boy next to me to back off, he just said he'd like it. I was sat next to a girl who was friends with the boys and she told them to stop but only in a jokey way and kept laughing about it with them. My friend also had weird things said to her about her cat but was thankfully, far enough away to avoid most of it. None of the boys ever said anything to each other about stopping but I did notice some were silent. When we landed I hadn't really processed what happened and called the boy who sat next to me disgusting whilst he stood next to a teacher, and they both laughed it off as I didn't sound serious. Later I told a female teacher that I trusted alongside my friend, at this point we were still at the airport. She became physically angry and went to tell the other teachers what had happened. The head of year who had also accompanied us said we would deal with it soon as it was late on Thursday at that point. We drove back on the bus and I tried to pretend nothing happened and get some sleep. I went home, then the next day I went in and everyone was tired and nothing was done. The next week came around and I think I'd told my parents by this point. My head of year had a talk with me to write things down during my next lesson and what I wanted to happen with the main boy. I went to sit with the teacher i had first told and sat in her room whilst I wrote it. Some things happened and about a week later I had a sit down in a room with my head of year and the boy. He apologised and received a warning on his prefect status and his head boy status. Nothing further happened. I felt cornered slightly to say that's as far as I wanted it to go as it was his first time doing anything like this and he seemed apologetic. Even now I feel conflicted and I still think about it. My head of year, who also taught me did make the effort to put him on his own in the corner of the class away from me. I don't really talk about this with anybody so this has been nice.",,
When I was 12 I had a crush on this boy. I was so blind sighted and thought he was the sweetest ever. Then I started to notice how he treated me. He would make sexual jokes to me when I told him I was uncomfortable. He recommended that me and my best friend should have sex. He made inappropriate jokes about boobs and vaginas. There was a moment where I was being a bit flirty with him and we got a bit close. I was excited thinking it would be my first kiss. He ended up trying to sneakily touch my boob. I thought he did it on accident until he tried again. Yet I still ignored it. I finally started to realize what was going on and stopped talking to him. He tried to apologize but really he told me “ I just want us to be friends again so this drama can stop.” I never told my parents. Only my best friend knew. This may not sound like a big deal but I was 12. I didn’t know what was going on. After it happened I felt like I was in the wrong and I felt ashamed that I let it all happen.,,
"""Whilst at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], boys would constantly rate girls based on attractiveness and how they fucked. Boys were trying to constantly humiliate girls sexually and fixed on their physical appearances. I think a lot of this led to eating disorders amongst the girl including myself. Several boys had raped or sexually assaulted girls and boys I knew there.,Boys at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] were the same - even from as young as 12 they would spread round nudes, makes disgusting comments about girls. I was humiliated from the age of 13 about boys talking about my breasts which led to a spiral of hating my own body. One boy I was seeing sexually assaulted me and kept trying to touch me in inappropriate places and pressure me into sex. When I broke up with him he lied about the things we did and went on to make me feel bad bout being ‘frigid’.,In fact, most boys I encountered at London schools between the ages of 13 and 18 seemed to be okay with pushing sex onto girls and humiliating their bodies. It was completely normal and girls wanted to be liked by boys so we accepted it.,Boys only - and still do - only think of us as sex objects for their gratification.""",,
"My day was always a touchy person and I have never really thought about all that he did was bad until recently, I was young and didn’t understand at the time. He’d touch my bum and thigh, and make sly comments about my chest. But I think the most that affected me was when he’d come into the bathroom when I was in the shower ( we didn’t have a curtain either only a glass door with no corner to hide around) and when I’d try to cover myself he’d say I wouldn’t need to, even though I’m a 14 year old girl still developing. Another memory I have that’s burned into my mind is the time I went on vacation with my dad, my stepmom, and my little sister. At night in the bed beside myself and my sleeping sister, my dad and stepmom engaged in sexual activity and I was awake for the full 43 minutes of it, silently crying to myself making sure my sister stayed asleep. I was 13 at the time and knew it was wrong but wasn’t brave enough to bring it up again. I’m currently 16 and suffer with severe anxiety and body dysmorphia.",,
When I was 15 I was groomed by a 28 year old man he manipulated me for 6 months and all that time I thought he was 17. In august 2019 he broke into my home while my parents were out and raped me.,,
"I keep seeing on here that only boys are called out, but I think it’s important to realise girls can be just as bad. In school, my ex girlfriend would always pressure me into having sex even after I kept saying no again and again. She would even cry until she got her way (saying how horrible it was of me that I didn’t want to have sex) - it felt so manipulative. At the time She made it seem like it was my fault that I wasn’t making her happy, and it would constantly fill me with dread having to go see her as I knew she wouldn’t be happy if I said no. I also didn’t realise how bad this was as I thought if you were in a relationship you owed your partner sex. I felt I could say nothing because I was a guy, and guys don’t get assaulted, right? It’s made worse by the fact that she was so vocal about feminism and sexual assault - without even considering for a second that she was sexually assaulting me repeatedly. Consent works both ways.",,
Since the age of 13 i had been experiencing boys looking up my skirt and lifting my kilt up without me knowing when I was just trying to get on with class. Upon quite a few occasions I knew that they were taking photos up my kilt too but I was to embarrassed to say anything. We never had the option to wear trousers either to prevent it,,
i used to have this guy bsf named [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] one day we decided to exchange nudes cus why not but i had told him not to ss or anything but a few weeks later we got in an argument and he had told me that he had ss my nudes and he showed his friends my pics without my consent.,,
"When I was in year 8 a new boy joined my school. He followed me on Instagram and I followed him back. He then messaged me, which I thought nothing of, as he was new and I wanted to know him a little. Yet the conversation slowly turned more and more sexual, with him asking for me to be his girlfriend and for him to see revealing pictures of me. I then said no, yet he kept on asking me, getting more and more angry. He then called me a slag and a bitch, saying that I was ugly anyway and that he never liked me. It made me really uncomfortable. Now, a year later, he messaged me for a week trying to get my attention, even asking me friends if they knew when I would message him back. It makes me really uncomfortable to know that this boy goes to me school and does these things to lots of girls.",,
"When I was younger I was at a party and a guy who I hadn’t spoken too at all that night literally grabbed me. It was late in the night and I was clearly drunk. Still having barely spoken to him, he started kissing me and undressing me, I was so uncomfortable about the situation. Literally I just froze and my body shut down, when he tried to have sex with me it wouldn’t fully work and I was clearly in a lot of pain but he kept on trying regardless. my body was literally saying no as I felt like I verbally couldn’t. He didn’t ask or say anything, he just took out his dick. It was literally as though I was a mannequin doll. I was super embarrassed about this and took me a while to realise this was not ok, there was 0 consent. For at least two years after this experience any sexual encounter I had as soon as it would come to sex (even though I wanted to) my body would continue to shut down. I would feel so embarrassed and ashamed as I didn’t know why it was happening. It was only when I went to a gynaecologist about this she explained to me, that because of this bad experience I had when I was younger, the anxiety that followed after had triggered a psychological part of me to shut down when I would be with a guy. It took a lot of time, patience and trust to get over this both mentally and physically. This is something I have literally never told anyone. But since you made this account I have heard his name come up amongst my social circle a lot in regards to mistreating girls and using them as sexual objects. 1 boy can cause so much damage...It just goes to show how important is it for boys to be educated at a young age to prevent this.",,
"i’ve had a lot of men in my life mistreat me, whether it was some of my closest friends or a complete stranger on the street. incidents where friends forced me to give them head, pushing me down and not letting me leave even after saying the words “no” multiple times. being followed by groups of older men. having an unknown older man kiss me and grope me when i was suffering an episode, persisting for me to give him my address. being drunk and having men take me upstairs and take advantage of me. i remember hooking up with a guy, knowing i didn’t want to have sex, but we did anyway and even when i wanted to stop, he didn’t. my body hurt afterwards as it was very rough, and i remember going to the toilet and seeing blood. as a way of coping, you become self destructive and fall into the same scary situations because it’s all you know, and you’ve never had a man treat you right. i let people hurt me again and again because i didn’t know any better. my view on how men were supposed to treat me was that how i felt never mattered. it’s just easier to go along with it, because my experience has taught me you can’t fight what’s about to happen - you just have to accept your about to have something bad happen to you. it was only recently when i had sex with a man who didn’t force me into it, and i actually felt somewhat safe. but i still can only have sex when drunk or on some kind of substance, because the one time i didn’t my mind took me back to memories i didn’t want to remember and i panicked. im terrified to send this in fear someone will find out it was me saying this, but i feel brave for it, and so should everyone else sharing their experiences.",,
"When I was 8 years old my dad came into the bathroom after my bath and touched me and I didn’t know at the time bc he said he was just “drying me off.” Then when I was 15, I dated this guy who touched me all the time and became abusive and when I said no- he took me home and left me in the street. When I was 15 turning 16 I went to a summer camp where I was assaulted by a boy from another church. When I was 18, my boyfriend wanted to have sex (which we’d done before. all consensual) but this time i didn’t feel like it but he kept pressuring and eventually gave in to him. My stories do not define me though. They have made me stronger & I know who I am because of it. 🤍",,
"When I was 16 I went on a night out with a boy I fancied, one of my friends and one of his friends. As me and this boy were getting on well, my friend made an excuse and went home and expected his friend would do the same to leave us alone. He didn’t leave and then more of his friends turned up meaning I was the only girl out with a group of boys. I decided to leave and on my way out one of them pushed me up against a wall and lifted my skirt up, and started dancing provocatively against me with my underwear on full view. The boy I fancied saw it and didn’t care. We were in a packed club in full view of the bouncers. No one else around us did anything about it except the bouncers who basically tutted at him and said come on, that’s not nice is it. I was horrified that he wasn’t thrown out of the club and the bouncers found it mildly amusing. The boy who did this now has 2 children with an old friend of mine and I can’t bring myself to tell her about this incident.",,
"i was 15 and it was my best friend’s older brother. we started talking through snap as friends and asked for me to sneak out to hang out with him. i was young and stupid so i did it. we drove around for a lil bit and then he parked in a dark area. he asked me if i wanted to get in the back, and i agreed while having no idea what would happen next. he asked if i wanted to do it and i said i don’t know… i never once said yes. he did things to me and then dropped me off at my house. he didn’t talk to me for days after so i thought that i had done something wrong. he ended up blocking me shortly after. my friends think that i willingly did it bc i told them this so they didn’t feel bad for me. i don’t for them to take pity on me for being so stupid and dumb. i still get ptsd to this day… my parents found out that i had lost virginity and i had lie to my own parents and say i did it willingly. i hate him for taking it. i should’ve stayed home that night.",,
I started getting catcalled in the street at 14 when wearing ripped jeans and boots. All girls I knew had experienced some forms trees harassment by the age of 16,,
I was groped whilst getting on the bus and I didn’t know who it was as the guys were in a big group,,
"When I was in Year 8, I was walking with my mum on the street when a boy (in his school uniform probably from a Saturday detention) walked up behind me and grabbed my bum. My mum turned around and asked him what he wanted and he said he was looking for the train station (which he had just walked past). I was so shocked I didn't know what to say and afterwards, I was scared to see his face every day when going to and from school, as I lived nearby. It's made me aware of people around me, when getting on the bus or when someone is walking close behind me.",,
He was the year above me and knew I was drunk and he was grabbing me towards him and tried to have sex with me and I kept refusing. Then he pulled me into a bush and started to touch me up and make out with me. He then left cause he wasnt getting what he wanted.,,
"I was 14 when I was groped under my school skirt in public by boys that looked far younger than me. I still haven't completely recovered from the experience despite that being four years ago now, and sometimes still remember the feeling of his fingers touching me. It was humiliating and led me to feel detached from reality for around a year, waking up crying most days.",,
It was last year in 6th grade I was in gym and this guy put his hands on my chest and pushed me and I thought nothing of it until few days later he kept doing that where the part it made me very uncomfortable and he would talk dirty to me and I’m sometimes scared to go back there.,,
When I was in Year 7 I was touched inappropriately by a boy in my class. He put his hand on my thigh then slowly put it further up until it rested on my privates. I tried to move his hand away but he put it back. I didn’t tell anyone except you now,,
"When I was in year 9 and 10, my form teacher would talk to me and my friend about his divorce, how he hadn't had sex in a while, and that he knew where he could ""get it for £20"". He would repeatedly talk to us about sex and went on to harass another friend at which point I told another teacher. He was already leaving the school that year so the school didn't do much, and the police took no action.",,
"they kept squeezing my neck and then hit me in my jaw. And a teacher saw, and they instead of telling them off, told me not to mess with them.",,
I go to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and every boy in my old friendship group bragged about sexually assaulting/ harrassing girls. I didn’t say anything cos of “bro code” but wish I did because it was completely fucked.,,
"When I went to a club for the first I got way too drunk (possibly due my excitement of my first grown up night out) and ended up being sexually assaulted by a boy who I’d thought was my friend and who I thought would look after me in the vulnerable state I was in. It took me a while to come to terms with what had happened and to fully understand the depth of how I had been taken advantage of by someone I had trusted. I blamed myself for a long time for drinking too much and putting myself in that position but have now realised that it was never my fault and is never the fault of victims, only the perpetrators.",,
"A week or so after I turned 18 I went to a friend’s party. I started getting with a boy. We went to the bathroom and he took drugs in front of me and continued to get with me, I should’ve left the situation then but didn’t. He then started trying to finger me through my clothes which was quite painful. We went back to a friend’s house for afters and I went down to the basement with him. We were still kissing and he began to finger me, I consented to this but not in the manner he did it. It was very aggressive and painful. I was drunk but coherent. I remember trying to pull his hand away because of the pain, but he continued. I just remember the aggression. I didn’t say anything and I wish I had . I realised I was bleeding, a lot, and was so embarrassed I quickly got dressed, I still haven’t worn the outfit I wore that night and the trousers still have blood stains. I remember feeling quite shaken after it happened but brushed it off. I had consented to be in that room with him and get with him so I told myself I was overreacting. It was the way it happened, I can still remember the pain and how vulnerable and empty I felt after.",,
"I wasn’t raped. I was just touched they said. A group of boys who were older than me followed me to the bus stop home, every night. They would try and touch me, push me, call me names like their little prostitute. And no one believed me because why would older boys want something to do with a young girl. When someone did believe me I wasn’t valid cos they never forced me into having sex they just touched me without consent :( I have so much built up anger I just want people to understand.",,
"I was 17 and had just finished my first year at my new school (it’s co-Ed at sixth form). My guy friend said his friend in the year above who had just finished school was interested in me so we started talking on snapchat and after about a week he asked to see me. I said yes but then kinda went off the idea as I wasn’t really into it but he wouldn’t take no for an answer and kind of manipulated me into thinking I had to go on a date with him (I was really inexperienced with guys at this point). I eventually agreed to meet him and we ended up walking around London, he seemed quite nice and we had common interests but I didn’t fancy him. He suggested we should sit on a bench and I purposely sat quite far away and then I saw him spit his gum out and he kind of lurched at me and kissed me and I really wasn’t comfortable with it, especially so publicly so I suggested we just walk around a bit more. He kept trying to point out more ‘private’ places to kiss but I just kept saying no not there etc as I just wasn’t comfortable. The evening went on and it got quite dark and I made up some excuse saying that I needed to go home but he kind of wouldn’t let me leave. Then we sat on another bench and he started kissing me again, I didn’t say no but was visibly uncomfortable. He then proceeded to put his hand up my shirt and under my bra, when lots of people were still around and I said no. He then tried to take me into an alley and I said I didn’t want to go and he kind of insinuated it was to go further but that we didn’t have to and I was just like I need to go home but he still pleaded that I stay. Eventually I was getting quite stressed as he wouldn’t let me leave and I didn’t want to be with him so I started getting heart palpitations and told him (said it was sometjing to do with medication) and he said something along the lines of ‘ok when there’s a medical/health issue that’s where the line is drawn’ - insinuating that I couldn’t have gone home for any other reason. I didn’t know how to feel about it when I got home but knew I couldn’t tell my close guy friends as their loyalties were with him but I later found out he went to see them straight away and told them all about it, along with people in his year that at this point were in different countries Interrailling and even guys he wasn’t friends with, and it got back to other people in my year too. He kept asking to see me after this but I made it clear I couldn’t see him. Then later on in the summer I was talking to this guy from a different school that I really liked and my friends in my year found out and told him. They didn’t know his name or anything just where he was going to university and somehow the guy from my school figured out who it was and told all my friends even though I didn’t tell them and didn’t want anyone knowing, which I found really creepy looking back on it - like how did he figure it out?? I later found out he had had a bit of an obsession with me the whole time I was in year 12 and kind of feel like he stalked on me like prey and abused my naivity. Although I’m lucky nothing else happened, I know how common it is for guys to feel entitled to kiss or do other things to girls that make them uncomfortable (after similar conversations with girl friends) and it just upsets me that I felt like I couldn’t tell my guy friends as they would villainise me and not the guy from the year above/I didn’t want to tarnish their relationship with him but yet it put a strain on my friendships with these guys as they couldn’t possibly understand why I didn’t like their close friend.",,
"This school has a terrible rape culture, perpetuated by the behaviour of some staff. On mufti-days, girls are told off if their clothing exposes their midriffs or shoulders (in the past some were even sent home), and even on normal school days, some male teachers tell girls to roll their skirts down, if they feel that their skirt lengths are ""inappropriate for school"". In the past, there has been a ""uniform target of the week"" set, and on several occasions, the item of uniform in question has been the length of skirts. They are complicit in the sexualisation of their own pupils. A majority of girls have experienced sexual harassment or assault in and out of school. Some have gone to staff, including the head and those responsible for safeguarding and nothing has been done. Going to the police is not even an option. They are told that they are not allowed to speak about it to anyone in case it ""upsets"" the perpetrators (who are allowed to go about everything freely as though nothing has happened, and some continue to openly harrass their victims) and causes ""safeguarding"" problems, and others who are heard speaking about it are told not to ""spread rumours"". They need to do better for their students.",,
Most of the rowing coaches are amazing but there is one guy who’s really creepy. He flirts with all the girls and if you want to be in the top boat you basically have to flirt back. He used to make me feel really uncomfortable and some of the things he said and did I now realise were just wrong. Everyone knew (knows) what he’s like but nobody does anything to stop him.,,
"In my year 7 summer I went to my cousin’s apartment in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. She had a group of friends there and there was a boy who was 14 and also had an apartment in the same building. In the pool we would play games, like tag, and under the water he would keep pulling my swimming costume down in the front and between my legs, especially close to my genitals. He would also grab and pinch my butt hard. It hurt and made me really uncomfortable but I would brush it off and keep playing. He also slapped my 10 year old cousins bum when we played hide and seek. I didn’t fully understand what had happened was assault, until I told a friend in year 10.",,
my skirt was lifted up by another student when i was drinking from a water fountain,,

"I was at a gathering at my friends one night with a few people and got extremely intoxicated to the point I was barely conscious. I couldn’t move and the person who’s house it was put me in their bed after I collapsed and one of my “friends” volunteered to look after me. I was slipping in and out of consciousness when he got under the covers and started rubbing on me, I couldn’t respond nor could I move and before I knew it he started raping me. Because of how intoxicated I was the next morning I didn’t think anything of it and brushed it past, however it has damaged my mental state so much. Before this happened the guy had asked me if I ever would have sex with him and I would always tell him I wasn’t interested in him that way. Instead of respecting my decision he waited until I was intoxicated enough to have sex with. I hate this boy so much and no one thinks he’s done anything wrong because I never stepped up about it, which is my biggest regret.",,

"I was close friends with a boy from the bedford area and we were close for a while, i knew they he liked and wanted to be more than friends. one day i ended up sleeping with him and did so a few more times. however the last time we had sex i was in pain, wasn’t in the mood and wanted it to stop, i initially gave consent but then asked him to stop he asked me if i was ok, i replied no and said i was in pain asking him to stop yet he continued for for some time whilst i was frozen in pain and shock until he had finished.",,
boys often used to take photos up girls skirts in lessons or in hallways but when it would be reported girls were told if our skirts were longer it wouldn’t have happened.,,
"When I was in my first year of university, I broke up with my boyfriend who did not respond well to this. I moved accommodation because I didn’t feel safe with the knowledge of him being aware of my location. One night, when I was about to leave my flat alone he appeared. I was going on a night out, which didn’t sit well with him. He appeared drunk so I said I’d order him an Uber home. He however decided to lock me in my room from which he began to hit me, kick me, smash my belongings, try to have sex with me, kiss me, rip my clothes. I managed to get hold of my phone, I had no service in my accommodation so my friend called the police. The university staff came, the police dismissed it as a ‘domestic’ yet the university didn’t provide me an alternative location to stay, given my flat was torn apart. This boy, had an unconditional at my university, despite the fact I told members of staff I didn’t feel comfortable with him attending university after attempting to rape me and telling me he ‘was going to fucking kill me’... he did. He is still there. I contacted the university last year, after leaving and reflecting on it - it didn’t sit well with me. They told me they had no record of this situation. He was placed in an all girl’s accommodation, they saw no issue in this. I felt undermined and ridiculed - I never felt safe. When I did see him again, he tried to push me in a queue of a club. That says it all. That night, I was alone, I looked around my room and everything was ruined. I felt embarrassed, I had just moved accommodation to be safe and instead I wasn’t. I had been beaten, I had bruises, the next day in my seminar people asked my I had a bruise on my face and cuts on my arms. I was abandoned completely. Yet a white man got away with it and I’m left with the trauma.",,
"My boyfriend asked me to send nudes - I knew how they often got circulated around the boys so really didn’t want to. He made me feel as though I didn’t value him/our relationship if I didn’t send them, and acted as though it was an obligation as his girlfriend to send them. It felt as though I owed him something. The boys had an expectation for girls to do certain things, and we’d be judged both if we did or didn’t do them.",,
"I was on a night out at uni and was having a great time except I noticed that this guy kept standing behind me. I moved and then he would be pressing himself against me from behind again. I moved again and there he was. I told him to please move and he just stood there. I felt so helpless because he was just pressing himself against me. My friends all tried to block him away and eventually he left, but I felt so disgusting.",,
"My old boss used to make numerous inappropriate sexual comments towards me, asking me to suck him off, saying that his office could be his special place for us. One time when he was driving me home he made a joke about how easy it would be to rape me.

Everything was going well for a few days going back and forth to their house painting and having fun, but one day they decided to have a different kind of fun. Some fun for adults he said because I didn't know what that meant I agreed doing what they wanted me to do. They touched and groped me in their house and even had the audacity to touch me even when my mom is around, just secretly. I never told anyone since they said that it was gonna be my fault and that no one was gonna help. 5yrs has passed Im 15 right now and still haven't told anyone even my parents.",,
i was groped in class multiple times in class and thought nothing of it at the time because i blocked it out of my memory because i felt uncomfortable. other girls in my year have come forward about sexual assault and rape allegations and the school has done nothing. we’ve been told there’s no proof or that they simply don’t believe us or that because the boys deny it that we are the ones in the wrong for ‘making this up’. as well as this there is constant degrading language used towards the girls and no action is taken by staff despite so many people attempting to go forward. i cannot wait to leave this school and go somewhere where i feel like people care and listen to the women,,
"I was 14 and the boy was 15 . It was very difficult because it was my first sexual experience. We were quite good friends before it happened. One night at a gathering of a couple of people I would say maybe 7 or 8. This boy I know starting getting with me, we had all been drinker, and not being a heavy drinker, was very drunk to the point where it would’ve been best if I go home. The boy took my hand, and led me outside, being his friend I trusted he was actually going to help me. People at the gathering asked him where he was taking me, and he said some fresh air. We went outside, whilst drunk and unable to recognise what was happening , he pulled my trousers down and starting penetrating me. Some people came outside, and he stopped and stood in front of me so people wouldn’t see what he was doing and that my trousers were down. I was unable to speak up because I was drunk and I couldn’t string words together. He repeatedly told everyone that I was fine and was getting some air. When people went back inside he took my around the corner and proceeded to have penetrate me. I couldn’t move and froze up because I didn’t understand why someone I thought was a friend would be willing to violate me in the way that he had. I shared my feelings with some friends, and soon it felt like everyone knew. Whilst some people did believe me, others were skeptical. People continued to be friends with him, even when I felt uncomfortable. Years later because I was forced to be friends with him, and with people constantly saying it was a long time ago, he’s grown up, I forgave him and even had a friendship with him. But I felt like people disregarded my experience with him after forcing me to forgive him. And I never felt like I couldn’t speak about it to any of my friends. It was very difficult time, and really messed up my perception of sexual relationships. I felt like I had the reputation that I would have sex with anyone, and that I was a liar. It’s made it hard for me to ever want to get in a relationship because a boy I trusted violated me. It was a couple of years ago now, but it still plays over in my mind from time to time, and it’s hard to think that was my first sexual experience. It meant to be something sacred and special but it was made vile and abusive. I’ve never spoken out my experience like this, so I’m grateful for this platform you’re giving people to speak about situations that are hard to talk about otherwise.",,
"My story is in no way comparable others. but my ex pressured me into sending on multiple occasions. whenever anyone asks i always say i haven’t sent to him bc i’m ashamed that i didn’t say no enough and that i let myself be pressured into it. he didn’t save them, but he cld hv done the secret ss. he was like “do it for me” “if you love me you’ll do it” and i kept saying that i wasn’t in the mood or jus saying no. it got the point where he didn’t speak to me for like a week on both occasions bc i said no. and then he wld pu again and ask, so i jus did bc i needed the convo w him and i jus needed to talk bc we were together.",,
"In the mid 1990s, I was a student at the [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. The son of a lecturer raped me. We were cuddling, and I told him that I didn’t want to have sex, so he pushed his penis inside me, and told me he was ‘just slipping it in’.

"Last year, at a Houseparty where there were boys from several schools, I met a boy who seemed very nice and who I seemed to think I could trust immediately. We got off and everything seemed fine. Later that night, I went back to his house and slept with him. Later that week, rumours started going around that I hadn’t consented which weren’t true, however, when he found out things got really out of hand. Two weeks later his parents sent two of their lawyers to my house along with a document for me to sign saying that I had consented and an agreement not to speak about what had happened. At first I refused. Three weeks later I felt pressured to do it because they had hired someone to follow my dad in Paris and had a folder of photos which would end his career - I won’t go into more detail as it will give away who I am. I was left disgusted that they would go after my family’s livelihood to protect themselves over a fake rumour. Boys like this think they have a pass to do whatever they like because they have powerful parents. It’s appalling.",,
The male teachers at school frequently slut shame the girls. One teacher in particular walks around with a ruler to measure if girls’ skirts are too short and teachers will humiliate girls in front of their friends if their skirts are deemed too short (most of the time they’re a perfectly reasonable length). Teachers will even sometimes pull down girls skirts for them.,,
"At the beginning of year 9 a new guy joined our school. We ended up adding each other on a social platform and one day sparked up a conversation. From then we became good friends, although he did start showing that he might want something more. He would casually drop sexual comments but my naive mind would ignore him and brush it off. One day we went to a mutual friend's house that was quite far away, consequently we shared an hour's bus ride together after meeting at a bus station. I mention this as on the way back, when we waited at the bus stop near her house, he put his arm around me and then put his hand on my breast. I told him to get off and grabbed his hand. He laughed and said he wouldn't let go till I did. But when I did let go he put his hands completely into my bra, grabbing my breast. I was upset but had to spend an hour with him to get home, so by the end of the journey we had made up and I decided to let it slide. We continued our friendship and eventually it became romantic. One day we took a walk in the park and as we turned to a private corner, he dragged me beside a large statue and tried to rape me. I fought him off. I left with my tights ripped and a whole lot of confusion. He broke up with me that very night. I convinced myself it was just a game, he wouldn't do that right? And brushed it off. Months later, he came back pleading for us to be together again. I gave in and said yes. But this time, he kept asking me to have sex. He knew I was celibate because I'm a Christian so he started manipulating me, saying how we will marry one day so it doesn't matter. He kept saying this till I cracked and let him get what he wanted. Then, after he got it, he never spoke to me again. Pressured me into losing my virginity and left like it was nothing, I suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for years because of him. I temporarily gave up my faith too, fortunately Jesus found me again and he has been my biggest hope in this world. But I am still on a healing journey. The school did nothing about it when I told them, I still had to sit next to him in classes and he lived normally. Another girl came forward saying he raped her, they still didn't take her seriously and he was allowed in school normally. He was not punished for any of his actions and the second girl who came forward was ridiculed even though I knew she was telling the truth. I kept what happened to me private, so no-one knew besides staff and my best friend. I still expected justice to be served but it wasn't, schools must do better. Years later I messaged him on instagram saying that I forgave him, for my own conscience. He told me he doesn't recall ever doing anything bad to me. Clearly because his behaviour was never challenged so he did not understand why it was wrong. Consent and Sexual assault must be incorporated into PHSE and other sessions at schools, we must do better.",,
Guys would just ask me for nudes like it or I was nothing.,,
"I was in year 9 and he was my boyfriend at the time, I was a virgin and didn’t feel as though I was ready to have sex yet. However he increasingly made advances and tried to have sex when he knew I wasn't comfortable, for example on New Years he was really drunk and tried to get me to have sex and said I should have said yes because i had allowed him to stay over. Later on in the relationship he used to get very violent and punch walls whenever I said no to sex, when we finally did it was such a horrible experience. About a month after that he continued to be aggressive, and one time I was very drunk and passed out, when I woke up I was in his bed naked and I didn’t know what had happened but my legs and back were in pain. I still don’t know what happened when I was passed out to this day but for years people told me it was okay because he was my boyfriend and only from seeing this page have I realised how wrong it was that he did that to me.",,
I was raped by a boy in my year at a party and then someone else took advantage of that situation,,
When I was 14/15 I went to a part hosted by a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Whilst standing and talking to a friend one of the boys from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] grabbed me by the waist and pulled me onto his lap. When I tried to get up he put both arms around my waist and tried to shove his hand down my pants. No one in the room said anything or tried to help me whilst I was struggling to get him off me. When I finally got up and pushed him off his chair another boy told me that I was being a bit harsh and to cut him some slack because he was more drunk than me.,,
"I was raped by 2 of my boyfriends at the time (on different occasions) they both pressured me into doing it by saying things like ""if you love me you would do this for me"" and would continuously ask me to perform sexual acts even after me saying no over and over again until i said yes. I would black out and have to take pregnancy tests because i didnt know what happened. No one that i told believed me, they all said things like ""oh --- wouldnt do anything like that, hes my friend and i know him"". Still to this day, i get told it was my fault that i was raped - ive even been told this by people who i considered my best friends.",,
"I was molested by someone I knew , I had no voice It started when I was 8 years old and carried on till now I’m 16 .,I was told who will believe me and who cares , your lying I managed to tell my therapist after 4 years of going to her . When I went forward or tried I was told and asked what was I wearing ? What did I do to turn him on ? I decided from that day to keep quiet .",,
"I didn’t know the kid, he very much sexually assaulted me and all my friends and raped a girl with autism. The school didn’t do anything about it and said that it happened because of what we were wearing.",,
We had an assembly last week at school and our deputy head mention this website. Nearly everyone has heard of it before but they made everything about this about the lengths of our skirts. They said ‘we don’t want people feeling uncomfortable or sexually harassed by other pupils that’s why we tell you to roll down your skirts’. They also said it would stop people from calling you a slag/slut. We don’t feel sexually harassed by students at our school they aren’t the problem we feel uncomfortable around the teachers. As soon as you walk in there’s 2+ older male/female staff staring at your thighs telling us to roll down our skirts even though they are at a proper length and fully rolled down. If we felt uncomfortable rolling up our skirts we wouldn’t we do it to make us feel comfortable and better in our uniform. When you walk around school you will turn round a corner and there’s a teacher staring at your legs. This personally makes us feel uncomfortable going to school.,,
When I was in year 9 I was speaking to a boy in year 11 at the time and he was forcing me to send nudes to him when I did not want to and he did not leave me alone if I said no. I felt so pressured to send him stuff so he would leave me alone and one time after I did he screenshot everything and threatened to tell everyone and leak them if I didn’t send more. I told him that I would not send him anymore and blocked him.. luckily they were never shared but I was so scared that I was going to be humiliated in front of everyone and was so ashamed of myself and one year later and I’m still terrified of any man doing that to me and I can’t forget it.,,
"I was 16 and out with a group of 4 friends (5 including me) in the evening, we were underage so we were drinking in a park. Me being a typical 16 year old girl got wayy too drunk and so 3 of my friends went around the corner to get some chips for us to all sober up a bit. I was left with a guy, who i had known and been friends with since we were 12, he had also dated my friend recently. Basically long story short we were sat on a bench waiting having quite a deep chat and i told him some personal things and so he knew i was vulnerable and then he thought it was okay to put his hands in my knickers (i was on my period may i add) and i was so out of it and scared that i froze. I remembering just lying there i think falling asleep and waking up over and over. Eventually the others came back with the food we ate and then they all had to basically carry me to the cab station (which shows how drunk i was). Me and the guy were sat inside the cab station and he did it again and the staff told us to leave and sit outside so he continued on the pavement by a main road, while the other 3 were around the corner smoking., A few days later when i told one of the friends and she confronted him his reply was ‘im a guy, guys get horny its not my fault’ and that was that.",,
I was sexually assaulted at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]- multiple men slapped my arse and made sexual comments towards my sexuality,,
"At 16 years old, I worked in a corner shop. The owner was drinking and asked me to go in the back room where he sat in a chair and asked me to give him a leg massage. I offered to get him a beer from the store first, and then ran out of the store. Next day back at work, nothing was said.",,
"I was making out with a boy and asked him to stop as I knew that I was too drunk to continue. He ignored me, I repeated it a few times and continued to get ignored. I said it more aggressively and he replied by saying “Do you actually mean stop or is it just that girly stop that girls say when they want the guy to continue” I felt so uncomfortable that he didn’t understand that no means no and that he attached sexual connotations to the word “stop”,Later on I texted him saying I no longer wanted to talk as he did not understand consent. He responded flippantly and we never spoke again.,I’m glad that he ended up stopping and nothing happened, but it’s the fact that boys are so comfortable continuing after someone says stop scares me, because I know that it’s a slippery slope to actual assault.",,
"I was at a club one night in my uni town and it had just recently introduced gender neutral bathrooms, so people of all genders were inside. I went in to use the bathroom and a man pushed his way into the stall with me and said 'Now we can all be like girls going to the bathroom together'. I asked him multiple times to leave. He exposed himself and began trying to get me to touch him. In this enclosed space I was very frightened and it took me screaming before anyone came to help because of how loud the music was. The man in question was someone known to me and a well known person on campus thats why I haven't told anyone who it was. Since then nights out have become very hard for me.",,
Someone started touching my crotch and when i told her to stop she continued until i removed her hand,,
"I was at a gathering with friends when me and one boy were left alone upstairs. He suggested we take turns going down on eachother, which I consented to. However after he had gone down on me I felt unsure, as I had never given head before and did not feel comfortable. I made this clear many times but he told me I had to do it as I had already agreed, and he kept saying how easy it was and how I’d enjoy it. I convinced myself for a long time that I was making the choice in that situation, but in reality he made me feel guilty and responsible for his not being pleasured. I was ashamed of my lack of experience and thought it was something I would just have to do, even if I didn’t want to.",,
I was 12 at the time and I was on a group call with my friends playing a game on a different device and I was sat in a position where I was laying down but also sat up in like oversized pyjamas and a guy in the call screen shotted me and outlined my bum and sent it around the group then threatened me with the picture and got angry after asking him to delete it.,,
"When I was 16 I went to a party with my then ex boyfriend. Throughout the night he got progressively drunker and started to just ignore me. I went to a different school and was not at all part of the social circles at his school. A group of lads at this party all started coming up to me and were pretending to be very welcoming (they’d clearly sensed I was uncomfortable and upset). I was lulled into a false sense of security and went to someone else’s house after this party (without my drunk ex boyfriend) and was the only girl there, leading to some really horrific instances of just being forced into things with some of them as part of a joke and a game. The next day I went home and haven’t spoken about this to anyone until even today because it makes me feel so so sick to think about back then.",,
A long serving member of staff reached around me and grabbed my breast to pull me out of a door way as he wanted through. He explained that he remembers a time when teachers were always let through and when students didn't dress like they were off to work the street corners at night. I was in my sports kit with a pair of shorts down to my knees.,,
I was raped by a man and it happened for years until I told someone it hurt to tell someone but I had to I didn’t understand at first but now I do and to think I let it happen again and again is making me want to die,,
"Secondary school was really hard for me regarding sexual harassment and assault. At school, i’m not sure about other year groups because i only really socialised within my own year, but we had a group of boys that were on the local football team as well as a few from the local rugby team that were in a group chat together. In this group chat they would say things about girls in my year. At one point (before i knew about this group chat) i was in a relationship with one of these boys. After we broke up i found out about this group chat. Not only would they degrade the girls from school they would post nudes from girls at school on some even sent to them by their own girlfriends. I was pressured by my now ex boyfriend to send him nudes. He would tell me that if i loved him i would do it for him, i was 14 at the time. I never found out if he sent them to that group chat but i know many girls who had their nudes sent around by these boys and even posted on social media. I had also sent a trusted friend of mine ,who was also a girl, a picture of me in a new bikini. she took a screenshot of it and sent it around the school. I was relentlessly sexual harassed and bullied after that. I took time off school because i felt so ashamed and disgusted and i was so worried my family would here about it and i would get in trouble all because i wanted her opinion on a new bikini. i was called a slag and slut, harassed by boys asking to see my boobs because they had seen a photo of my in a bikini. I remember, even from year 7, boys smacking my butt as i walked through corridors or groping my boobs. I had an ex boyfriend who would put his had down my skirt and into my underwear at school. I tried so hard to push him off telling him no but he would pin me against the wall and carry on. Another one of my ex boyfriends undid my bra whilst i was at school: we were hugging and he put his hands up my shirt i told him to stop it but he carried on anyways he then proceeded to unclip my bra and i pushed him off and ran inside to the toilets to do it up again. i was so embarrassed. All of this has made me very insecure and closed up, for a while i was very depressed and i now find it hard to trust people because of these experiences - sorry for this being so long but i have so much to get off my chest that i haven’t told anyone.",,
I sent nudes to a guy when I was about 15. When I was 18 my boyfriend at the time met the guy I had sent nudes to and they became friends. My boyfriend showed the guy a picture of me and the guy told my boyfriend I had sent nudes to him. He tried to show him the pictures of me but luckily couldn’t find them. My boyfriend then proceeded to phone me that night screaming at me for sending nudes to this guy but not sending nudes to him. I had never felt so ashamed in my life. That night I planned to take my own life. Luckily I thought of my family and friends and chose not to. It was literally the worst night of my life.,,
"During my first few weeks at uni, I was touched inappropriately many times by careless boys who were relying upon their intoxication to do it. I’ve had boys try and kiss me after I’ve edged far away from them in a clear display of discomfort and had people put their hands on my inner thigh/breast in an attempt to be subtle when I’ve stood near them.",,
"I was just out of high school and had recently gotten out of a long relationship. I was curious about the world of casual sex, as I had only really been with my female ex. I met a guy I’d went to middle school with and I went to his house expecting to sleep with him. I wanted to have sex, but was consciously aware that I was not ready or willing to give a blow job or do anything anal. We started to do stuff and it was all consensual until he stuck himself in my face and I tried to object, I know I gave verbal and nonverbal cues that I wasn’t down, but he pushed himself closer to me and I reluctantly gave him head and hated every second of it. I might have just shrugged this off, but he later started putting his fingers in my bum and I pulled his hand away and said “no, don’t do that.” He said okay, but continued to do it anyway. I felt so powerless and frozen. At one point, the position we were in was hurting me and though I said this to him and was trying to squirm out of it, it only prompted him to hold me down tighter and I eventually gave up and laid there hurting and trying not to cry. It’s been almost 3 years now and through some therapy and being with my respectful, patient boyfriend, I have worked through my experience and am now able to experiment with the things that were once traumatic to me. It does get better with support.",,
i had a boy at my school rape me at a party… he still tries to hit on me.,,
"This didn’t happen directly to me specifically but when I was 12, one lunchtime outside the entrance to my boarding house and some of the sixth form houses at the time when lots of students were walking past there was a man sat in his car with his window open masturbating. I remember the older girls being amazing and trying to get us younger girls to look away but even though I didn’t fully understand for years, I don’t think I will ever forget the image of him looking at us with his hand round his penis and how he did that in front of probably a couple hundred children",,
One of my best friends took advantage of me when I had just talked to him about being suicidal and I was incredibly drunk. I know that I did consent but I was not mentally stable enough or sober enough for the consent to be valid. The next day he said that he was also drunk so I had to forgive him because it was a mistake. I guess if he was as drunk as I was then it falls in that grey area which I know a lot of people struggle with but I'm pretty sure he knew what was going on and was a lot more coherent/sober than me. I honestly don't know if I could trust what he said as I don't remember a lot of the evening so most of what I know is from what he told me which is scary.,,
"Groomed, raped and assulted by someone 40 years older then me",,
"when I was in secondary school in year 8 and year 9 rumours went around about myself and I got called a slag, slut, hoe, you name it, I was called it. this really affected my sense of worth and put me off being with a boy for years, incase I was called a slag again. even if me and my friends argued with out boy group they would call us slags. when I walked home from school with my friends the boys would run up to us and slap our asses as hard as they could, and then proceed to laugh and joke about it with their friends while they ran away from us. at the time me and my friends thought this was weird, but we would have never seen it as sexual assault/harrassment. now we look back on it and think wtf???",,
"I was in yr 9 (13 yrs old) and had been invited to a yr 11 house party. I met this guy there who was In yr 12 and we chatted for a bit and I told him I was in yr 9 (so he fucking knew). Later that evening when people were rly drunk (inc. me), I went outside for a cig and he was there at the end of the garden looking pretty drunk. I went to chat if he was alright and we ended up kissing. I was fine w it n kind of wanted to but then he put his had down my shorts which was a complete first for me so I didn’t know what to do. The next thing I remember is that we were behind this shed at the end of this garden and I’m on my knees sucking him off. I suddenly freak out and know I didn’t want to do this so I stopped, he kept on pleading me to finish him off for ages and I kept saying no. Then luckily we heard someone coming so I took my chance and ran back to the party. Once I was inside where everyone else was I started crying because I felt so bad for running off(!!) I was so confused because this was the first party with older people and I really looked up to them so I felt like I was being so selfish and rude saying no. People around me were saying I shldnt worry n that he’s a nice guy so their sure he’d understand. They also said he hadn’t actually been w many girls so it must mean he likes me. At the end of the night I felt so bad so I said sorry to him and got his snap hoping we cld be friends. It has taken me 3 years to realise how fucked that situation was and how everyone was acting as if it was fine. I’ve been in denial and only know have I clocked that is was rape.",,
"I was sexually assaulted by someone I had placed my trust in, someone I considered a friend. A man I could feel safe around. We were out having a good time at first. The last thing I remember in the club was drinking a jagerbomb and then becoming blackout drunk. Whether I was spiked or not, I will never know. Next thing, I was being put into a taxi by the bouncer. I ended up back at my flat, on my own. I planned to just go to sleep. But he then knocked on my door, accompanied with my friend who had been with us. I proceeded to throw up, a lot. He held my hair back and put his fingers in my mouth to apparently help me. I remember then lying on my bed, head spinning. I said 'come lie down'. No prompts for sexual activity. I was half asleep. I then remember the feeling of fingers thrusting into me. It hurt. I let out a fake moan as I was in a confused state and couldn't comprehend what was happening. I was in freeze mode. I was also on my period, which made it more painful. I no longer have contact with this person. They betrayed me and shattered my trust in men. I'm slowly building this back with the help of male friends.",,
As a gay boy in school a lot of straight boys would message me late at night expecting to trade photos and talk sexually which did make me feel uncomfortable often. A guy who I had fully unexpected messaged me sexually and sent photos to me which I told a friend about. This led to me being assaulted in school and being made an example of by the school which has still left me mentally scarred to this day. I still struggle to deal with my day to day life,,
"I was in the sixth-form centre and was surrounded by boys discussing the recent news of a girl who'd been raped. They were loudly talking about how she deserved it due to what she was wearing and then started to openly discuss their own rape fantasies involving the girl. This conversation took place surrounded by other pupils and teachers, all within hearing distance, and yet no-one challenged these boys on their views.",,
"This isn’t about a specific story. Shit happens on a daily basis at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] wether it is the boys sexualising us when we r in our school uniform. Male teachers complaining about the lengths of our skirts because they are “distracting” when they should be the ones who remain professional. Boys slut shaking girls, showing everyone their nudes. I feel the need to hold down my skirt when going up stairs when boys are behind me. there have been so many times a boy has whispered “look at her batty”. All of this is never a one time thing it happens on a daily basis and needs to stop. Some poeple are blaming it on the education system and I agree with that to a certain extent, but it’s also about how boys talk to each other, no matter how many times the school tell them they will never stop doing it. The amount of disgusting conversations I have overheard is horrendous they are constantly rating girls, talking about porn, using nudes as a flex and show them off and if u receive from a fit girl u r respected more. School should be a place where girls and all students feel safe, not a place where we constantly have to worry about male teachers and disrespectful boys that chat shit.",,
The guy I was sat next to my English class thought it would be funny to try and touch my thigh fortunately I stopped him before he could but he was very close to touching me.The guy that was sat behind me keep encouraging him to try and touch me in different places to try and piss me off.,,
"When I was 15 I had my first boyfriend - who was a lot more sexually experienced. He was my first kiss, sexual encounter and romantic relationship. Every time we did more than just kiss I would be hesitant or tell him to stop and say I didn’t want to do that. He would ‘convince’ me to keeping going. He constantly asked to give him head, which I refused, but he would push my head down. I felt so unprepared and uneducated on consent, sexual pleasure for people with vaginas, and general sexual wellbeing. I later found out he was sleeping with many other people at the same time. When I look back now I realise many other manipulative stuff he did. This first experience of sex, trust and a morphed idea of consent - being persuaded to have sex with someone - has hugely affected how I deal with sex and relationships",,
was groomed by an 18 year old when i was 15 who targeted me though the fact we went to the same school the year he was leaving and had me in his car and gave me alcohol until i was almost unconscious or was unconscious. i don’t remember much of the night.,,
I was sexually assaulted by many males at school. It was like it was a game for them and they found it funny.,,
There was this guy I used to date and every time we would see eachother he would always want to do stuff.. and everytime I said no he would get really mad one time he even threatened to tell everybody a big secret that I didn’t want anyone to know but me and him broke up.. it still bothers me and now everytime someone touches me it makes me sick,,
"On international women’s day in year 11 the school hadn’t uttered a word in assembly or in any lesson about the significance of the day and so our female English teacher decided to dedicate our lesson to discussing it. She said how upset she was that the school hadn’t made an assembly and that it let down all the girls in the school. Our class only had 4 boys in it and around 15-20 girls. By the end of this lesson many of the girls were crying. Our teacher had put on an amazing TED talk where a woman had shared a rape testimony and the girls had all been amazed by it. However the atmosphere very quickly changed when the 4 boys began talking openly (in front of our teacher!) about how a girl deserved to be raped or assaulted if she wore a short skirt. I was distraught and sent an angry email to the headmaster including other stories I had about how sexist the school was and how it was allowing misogyny and rape culture to grow amongst the boys. They promised me they would make sure the boys received an educational assembly about respecting women and consent, but this never happened.",,
"A guy that i had became friends with always convinced me he was a good guy and would never do anything to hurt a woman and when he started to talk to me more sexually he started asking for nudes. I trusted him at that time sine he sounded so believable but turns out he took pictures of my nudes from another phone and sent them around to his friends, they would all add me on snapchat and whenever I would respond to one of their texts they would just send me my nudes to shut me up.",,
I was in class wearing Pe kit and when we were leaving class I dropped my phone. When I bent over to pick it up a boy came up behind me and slapped my bum. I was shocked and swore at him to go away. Later one of his friends showed me that he videoed it and sent it around school. I never got over it and left for college as soon as I could.,,
I was sexually assaulted by my ex. He repeatedly kept touching my ass and held onto my wrists really tightly so I couldn’t walk away. When he eventually let go I walked somewhere else and he moved with me and then touched my ass again.,,
"At the time I was in sixth grade (I’m about to be in 8th). The first time the person did “it” I was at lunch and he grabbed my butt. I was to scared to say anything because I blamed myself and thought no one would believe me. The person continued this for months before I found out they did it to multiple people. Not long after that we went to the vice principal and told him, he proceeded to ask us why we even came up to his office and only told the person not to do it again when he knew it had been going on for months. The person didn’t even have to say sorry. Sincee then I’ve completely changed the way I dress and honestly gave up on school because I know that no one in the education system cares about me, and why should I care about them?",,
"i was sexually assaulted back in may by i boy i thought that liked me. i don’t know what to do and i am too scared to tell anyone. He thinks i wanted it, he wouldn’t stop and i didn’t know what to do. it was the worst day",,
I was with a boy in a very open place when he kept putting my hand down his pants. I kept pulling my hands away and played it off as nothing. I had made it clear to him I wasn’t comfortable but then he pulled his pants down and I stepped away and told him no multiple times. He then ignored me as I tried to comfort him as he had made me feel like I was being stupid and I had done something wrong. I had never been intimate with a boy before.,,
"I lost my virginity at 15. I didn’t know him. I was held at gun point, and raped by a man. I was so scared. I said no, I pushed him off me numerace times, I pulled away but it didn’t work, I felt as if I was weak. I finally told my parents 2 days after and we went to the police, not enough evidence to prove it was non consensual sex, I was devastated. Sex should be an enjoyable experience but to me now almost 4 years on, it still affects me to this day and I can’t enjoy it. After the assault, I fell deep into depression and tried on numerace accounts to end my life. Us girls need to stick together. I got asked what I was wearing, that was the first question from the police officer. It shouldn’t be based on what we were wearing! I was wearing a jumper jeans and a puffer coat. I’m here for everyone on this site🤍",,
"On the last day of school, it was ‘own clothes day’ as we usually wear uniform. During a biology lesson, our teacher started making comments about how we were dressed. I was wearing a crop to and jeans, which is allowed, and he said that I was dressed too sexually and that he suggested I covered up. He also constantly stared at our tits and sent girls to the heads office when they refused to put on their jumper and cover up. The comments made us all very uncomfortable and we felt extremely violated but we know the school will do nothing about this.",,
When I was 16 I went to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I got really drunk and my friends introduced me to this group of guys. I got zipped up in one of their tents and blacked out. I remember waking up a few times to this 21 year old guy doing things to me. I left straight away in the morning and told one of my friends. she told me to stop complaining. It still hurts to talk about.,,
"At a party i was obviously drunk. i got pushed into a private room where i pushed against a counter and fingered against my will. i was so drunk that i couldn't speak yet he continued. the only reason it didn't go further was that another girl opened the door and distracted the guy letting me escape. i always believed that it was my fault, my fault for wearing a skimpy dress.",,
"There’s been multiple times where I have been touched, assaulted, and raped at this school and NOTHING was done about any of them, in fac I was suspended for “letting it happen” and “dressing up and asking for it” I wore skirts, and knee highs a lot. Kinda like the “alt” style going around. They made me feel comfortable and confident but I always remembered to where shorts, and long enough skirts. There was a few times where I would be minding my business and my ass would be grabbed by some random guy. We have security, and every time I told them, they would tell me “it was probably and accident”. They weren’t, grabbing and squeezing isn’t an accident. Around the end of this year, I was on my way to the bathroom. Some kid, much bigger than I was pushed me against the wall by the bathroom and touched my inappropriatly. Each time I called out for help and told him to stop, trying to push him away, all he said was “stop, you know you like it” and continued. After a while he took me into a stall and raped me. I went to the office the next day with doctor proof of dna and assault. They brushed it off, then later suspended me until January of next year. I told the cops, and nothing was done. My family doesn’t believe me, they told the cops I was mental. Growing up I was sexually abused by my step father. And I’ve told my family, and they told me I was delusional. They’ve done it during the school situation as well. I can no longer dress the way I like without feeling like I’m “asking for it”.",,
"I was walking down the stairs at work. A man walked passed me in the other direction, turned a looked at me and said “nice body” before walking on.",,
"Two boys, both who were my close friends at the time have touched me inappropriately IN SCHOOL. The first had made a lot of really uncomfortable comments about my body since I had joined in sixth form including stuff like ‘you need to grow your ass’ in front of people. It was some weird way of shaming me which I dealt with by being non-reactive instead of ever saying anything but I had suffered from BDD a lot as a preteen and these comments really, really hurt my growth. He would pinch my bum and squeeze me in front of our group of friends which I told him so many times very harshly to stop. The second only touched me once but it was a full on, very hard smack on the ass in the middle of school in front of a million people. I was so embarrassed and felt so disrespected, and immediately told him just that. He never touched me again but it took me dating a close friend of the first boy for him to stop which just told me he didn’t care he was making me uncomfortable and only stopped because he respected my boyfriend. It sucked so bad.",,
"I was 12 when the boy I was dating physically and emotionally coerced me into having sex. He gave my phone number to all of his friends- who then proceeded to message me, pressuring me into having sex with him. He emotionally manipulated me- bringing up his own trauma to guilt trip me into doing sexual things with him. If this didn't work he used physical force. I didn't come to terms with the trauma of this until years later. At the time it caused me to have anxiety and panic attacks, as well as the emotional turmoil of being slut shamed for something that wasn't my fault. I'm a lot older now but I cry after sex and I can't help but feel disgusted and ashamed.",,
"it happened for 3 years straight, i’m tired of being called a whore for things i did not consent on happening. they need to come clean and say they all touched me etc. you all planned to fuck me and forced me on u. u grabbed me by my wrist and i snatched it away but you still touched me it went on everyday. i also invited another kid to my house and he touched me after i said stop many times. all the countless nights i cried all the times i couldn’t look at my self by i was disgusted, all the times i sat on my bathroom floor ready to give up. all the times i’ve been asked to fuck by all you boys all of you are the problem. i said no you forced yourself onto me i said no but you still touched me i said no but you still tried to kiss me i said no and you still had the need to do the things you did. you all had a meet up site so you can all “hit” i was 12-14 when this was happening. it’s still happening but now that we are not in school it stopped. some days you would go onto other girls and back to me some days i guess i wasn’t good enough. you touched me many times said gross things to me and tried to get stuff out of me. i want you to know to all the boys who thought it was okay to do that to me and to all the other people who think it’s okay to sexually assault someone fuck you.",,
"I went to a friends house with 3 guys who I thought were my closest mates, yet one of them chose to take advantage and r*pe me whilst I was passed out from alcohol.,I pieced it together later that night when I had come around.,He said he couldn’t remember anything that had happened.,And now I have to face him everyday in the school corridor, he gets away with it because he was my friend and I didn’t want to get him in trouble but 5 months on and I’ve had enough, he’s had zero consequences and it is unfair.,The worst thing for me is that his friends stuck up for him and said they understand why he did it, even the guy I was talking to decided to side with him and said he was angry at me I shouldn’t have let it happen?!",,
I was coerced into sex by my best friend at the time on multiple occasions. I had just broken up with my boyfriend and he was comforting me and started forcing me to have sex with him. Once he gave me drugs and then forced himself onto me. He verbally assaulted me on many occasions and made me feel stupid when I said it had to stop. It took me 2 years to cut him out of my life.,,
I’ve had a boy tell me I’m ‘easy’ or relentlessly ask me personal questions about sex and insinuate I’m a slut and that “I have a lot of sex”. At that point I was in a long-term relationship with a boy I loved to pieces and trusted. Boys don’t understand boundaries.,,
"I was drunk at a party and passed out in my best friend’s bedroom and my then boyfriend was in the room with me, saying he was “taking care of me”. I wasn’t conscious and have no memory of this- I only found out 6 months later what happened to me from a friend who goes to school with him. Another person who was at the party walked in and saw him lying on top of me, wanking off but he didn’t see I was passed out as the light was off and my boyfriend yelled at him to get out and he did, thinking he’d accidentally walked in on us. I later heard (from the friend who goes to school with him) that he’d assaulted me when I was unconscious, but I obviously had no memory of this. We’d never done anything sexual like that before, and he knew I was about to break up with him- I dumped him the day after it happened without even knowing what had he’d done to me that night, and I’d been very distant for a few days beforehand so I think he knew it was going to happen. For ages I didn’t think this was big enough to share because I only found out half a year after it had happened, and by then I didn’t want to bring it up with my assaulter because I didn’t feel comfortable to, but it’s the fact that you never ever know something like this would happen to you in a situation where you’re close to the person who assaults you.",,
"When I was 21 I was raped by someone I trusted so much. I kept saying no, but froze when he penetrated me. I lay there feeling so numb. I disassociated, something which I often do now as a result of the ptsd I have. I’ve been in 3 separate forms of therapy for over a year to try and learn to live with it, but it has changed me forever. He whispered in my ear ‘I’m sorry’ as he did it, whilst I attempted to hold my breath until I passed out thinking he would either stop or I wouldn’t have to be aware of it happening.",,
"I was seeing a guy from my school. I think I had just turned 14. He was 2 years older than me. I had had an argument with my mum and as I was angry I messaged this boy and arranged to meet him. We ended up going for a walk and ended up in a wooded area. He was asking me to do sexual things. As I was 14 I hadn’t done anything before and was scared so said no. He was very persistent and started touching me. I was begging him to stop, saying no and trying to wriggle away from him. But he was a lot stronger than me and forced my head down onto his penis. He also pushed me onto the floor so he could have sex with me. I froze. When it finally stopped I called my mum to run me a bath as I felt so dirty. I then ran all the way home. When I got in my mum asked why I had so many leaves and twigs in my hair. I lied and said I was out with a friend and fell over. I was so ashamed. I finally went to the police who weren’t very helpful. The school also didn’t handle it well. He still went to the same school, and I saw him everyday after that. I was bullied so badly because no one believed me as he was “popular” and I wasn’t.",,
"I was in the first cohort of girls joining a boys school. The level of misogyny and sexism from both teachers and boys was horrendous. The girls were openly and constantly judged on their 'attractiveness', their sexuality. We were sluts but we were also too frigid. It was an extremely sexualised form of bullying and abuse. The staff knew what was going on, it had been reported, and sexual verbal abuse took place openly in lessons, yet nothing was done. It normalised a culture of sexism and harassment at the school and it would not surprise me if this stayed with the boys into their adult life. While at school I was assaulted by a boy I thought was a friend, but I didn't report it because when I spoke to others at school about it, no one seemed to think it was an issue.",,
I was walking to the club with my friends and a guy that we didn’t know. At one point he got me to walk a slightly different route to the rest of my group. He started kissing me and I pulled back and then he put his hands down my trousers and started fingering me in the street and suggested we go back to his after I told him to stop. I pushed him away and ran to the club but he followed me so I hid in the girls toilets till my friends could come and get me,,
"I was sexually assaulted by a classmate. There was only myself and him in the class at the time, he did what he did when the tutor left us alone in the classroom briefly. I was terrified and degraded. I was then threatened by this person so I kept quiet for a while after but it became too much to cope with and I eventually came out with what had happened to me. The lack of support from the college was disgusting, I was made to feel like a liar by them. Thank goodness for the support of my family. I ended up receiving counselling.",,
"""Last summer I went to a small gathering of people that were mutual friends (so we didn’t know them too well) with my 3 close friends. We were just chilling and drinking. There was a boy there that I knew had a crush on me but I didn’t do anything, because neither had he, until he started to get tipsy and move closer to me. He started touching me slowly. His hand was on my leg, moving up and down. When he laughed, he touched my arm. He kept on finding excuses to touch me. Eventually I got up and went to the bathroom because I started to feel dizzy. I went in and locked the door. I stayed there for a while as I calmed down and took some deep breaths. When I got out to leave, he was standing outside. He came onto me and started kissing me. I told him to stop. He didn’t listen and carried on kissing me all over and holding my arms back. I said again stop get off me. He didn’t listen. I had to push him and punch him in the face to get him off me. Why wouldn’t he stop when I said stop the first time? He was supposed to be my friend. I remember when I was with him and someone catcalled me he shouted at them, and then he goes to do this? ,When I left I burst into tears and my friend was clueless because she was with everyone else at the time in the garden. I told her what had happened and she explained to me how not okay that was. I tried to brush it off. I didn’t want to do or tell anyone anything though because I knew that they would find a way to blame it on me: I was drinking, it was late, I was wearing a skirt etc. and then make the whole thing even worse and more traumatic. Especially at my school because I know they have blamed the victims before. All they did was call her parents to tell them what happened and that there was drinking involved. Her parents blamed her. I didn’t want that to happen to me, especially because my parents are really strict, especially my dad",,
I was nearly raped when i was just four years old on halloween- worst night of my life…,,
"Was in year 9. Told a guy in my class that rape jokes were harmful as many woman were raped, and there was a chance someone that he knew could be when he was older. He told me “only the fit ones” and looked at me saying that it was a compliment. Got mad and everyone, even some of my friends laughed and said I was overreacting",,
"i was with my boyfriend (now ex) and we were sat watching a movie, a slightly sexual scene came on and he just looked at me and began touching me. after awhile he tried pulling my shorts off and when i told him i wasnt in the mood he pinned me down and continued anyway regardless of me telling him no. this wasnt the first time we had had sex but i didnt want to, i brushed it off afterwards but realised when i was telling my new partner what had happened that how wrong it was. this was a year ago and i feel so stupid for just letting him do that to me. everytime i think back to it i feel cheap, easy and dirty. i cant do this much longer.",,
"I was groomed and raped multiple times by a teacher when I was 15 years old, He was 30. He is still a teacher but in a different country. He gave me gifts, took me on trips and invited me to his house to watch films. I didn't know how wrong it was until i was much older. But it was so long ago, I dont have proof now. The damage is done already.",,
I was raped in the auditorium bathroom. I dont feel comfortable sharing anymore details.,,
I was assaulted at a party by a guy who was a grade ahead of me and some of my friends still talk to him like it didn’t happen.,,
"In the 1980s, when I was in what is now year six, we had a teacher who refused to answer questions unless we sat on his lap and gave him a kiss or a cuddle. He used to make us lie in a row on the school field and roll over each other to get to the other end. He called this a game. If we refused, he would humiliate us by getting us to stand on a chair and have everybody point and laugh, or he would have us recite nursery rhymes like a baby. He would also check people for cleanliness, giving them marks for scars and moles. Whoever was the ‘dirtiest’ had to stand on the chair again. He would throw balls at heads. He would crack a wooden spoon on heads. Once we went on a camp, and the outdoor swimming pool was freezing. He picked up a girl by an arm and a leg and threw her across the patio so she skidded across it almost bouncing before landing in the freezing water. He was a sadist. Her loved humiliation and power. He was very widely liked because he was also a sports coach, and people used to find his cruelty amusing. Back then, people wouldn’t remark on the sexualised element either. I ended up reporting him to the police in adulthood. I gave them a list of names of people I remember him abusing. Including the boy he physically slung across the front of the classroom. Nobody had the courage to testify. He still works in the education profession now, albeit in a different area of London. The police took his popularity as a sign that these things couldn’t have possibly happened. But we all remember them. It’s just that most people don’t want to go through them again even thirty years later. It is traumatic.",,
this one boy would touch girls in inappropriate places but everyone was too scared to say anything because he was popular and the teachers loved him,,
I was with this girl just talking and suddenly all her friends came over and in the fuss one of her friends just grabbed my dick and started feel my abs. To this day I don’t know which one it was and that she thought it would ok just because of the lack of clarity. Disgusting,,
"My boyfriend at the time was really nice at the start, soon after he started to hit me across the face, call me disgusting names and eventually he sexually assaulted me. It’s still upsetting - 2 years on, I never got any closure, any in-person apology, or any justice. I just wish I was smarter and listened to those around me.",,
When I was about 12 (year 7) I was on the bus home from school which was always really packed with school kids along with a few members of the public. You were all packed in really tightly so you could hardly move. Pretty soon after I got on I felt someone groping my bum quite vigorously over my school skirt. I was too scared and embarrassed to say anything and we were so packed in I couldn’t even tell who it was. It continued until I eventually got off the bus along with a load of other people about 10 minutes later. I still don’t know who it was or even if it was another school kid or an adult. I never told anyone.,,
A teacher put his head in my breasts and still works in the school they did nothing,,
"I was 14 at the time and he was 17 I don’t even know his name I just remember where he went to school, he repeatedly ket talking about how many girls he had gotten with and how experienced he was, he would constantly ask me for nudes and when I refused he’d call me a dirty sket. The first time I ever met him was at a Houseparty and I was on mdma he took me upstairs and had sex to me all the time I was high and was saying no as the act happened. Every time I think about it I feel dirty like I need to scrub all my skin off.",,
when i was in year 4 two guys in my class would always try to kiss me and i didn’t think anything of it because we were young but whilst sitting in the floor in classes a boy in my class would always touch under my skirt to my legs and my bum. I didn’t really think too much of it when i was younger as no adult had spoken about this kind of stuff but as i got older i always thought back to the thing making me depressed that i was so young and didn’t know how inappropriate that was,,
I about 8 years old at the time and my dad was drunk or high he told me to get on top of him and lay down next Thing I know he started kiss me with his tongue and rubbing my body against his private area that all I remember but I never told anyone,,
"Boys used to sit in the centre of the school where you have to walk past to go anywhere within school, and would sit on a bench rating girls as they would walk in on their sixth form induction day.",,
"I was 12. I was walking to the school bathroom and my male friend, at the time, grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me into the toilet with him. He put his hand over my mouth and told me to stay quiet or he'd tell everyone that I hooked up with a teacher (I hadn't but he knew how much it'd damage my reputation). He then proceeded to pull down my trousers and r-pe me. It felt like it happened for hours but it was only about 10minutes.I haven't told anyone to this day.",,
"When I was 16 me and a friend went back to a house with some boys we met outside a pub. They lured us there saying we could drink and smoke weed with them and that they had a hotel room (none of that was true) I was so drunk I could barely stand one of the boys had to hold me up. Later on one of the boys tried to have sex with me but I wasn’t into it at all so it hurt and made me bleed. To make it stop I offered to go down on him instead. I felt like i “owed” him something since I had come there at all. Once I was done he dragged me to his friend to do the same, I couldn’t breathe whilst it was happening and threw up multiple times whilst it happened but he kept going even whilst I struggled. When the second guy was done he passed me to the third who did the same thing. I blacked out a few times. Whilst we were there they kept trying to get us to admit that we weren’t 16, that we were actually 14. They genuinely thought they were doing this to a 14 year old. It’s been three years and it still makes me feel sick to this day and I can’t repeat that act on any boy without having a panic attack.",,
my ex best friend touched my boobs while my top off while we were switching swimsuits and she laughed it off,,
"A guy put his hand down my backless dress at a party once when I was 16, I was too drunk to really know what was going on but I asked him to stop and he didn’t. When I told my friend, he told me I shouldn’t dress like a slut if I didn’t want stuff like that to happen",,
I don’t like it when my grandfather tries to kiss me and he just forces it on me,,
"I woke up in the middle of the night to find my boyfriend (at the time) wanking over me while I slept. Just as I woke up and freaked out ,he finished and it went all over me. I remember he didn’t say anything and got back into bed. I tried to sleep but just cried.",,
I got grabbed on the areas twice by another student,,
I was around 15 and went out drinking with friends and was supposed to stay at my friends house but then late at night she said I couldn’t stay and said I should just go home but I couldn’t and I had to stay at this boys house who we’d been all hanging out with that night and I went to his and we slept in his bed and we both ended up shagging I was really drunk and didn’t want to and the condom broke and he said it was “ because he was too big” and I had to buy the morning after pill. Also in the morning when I woke up he kept asking if he could “ take my anal virginity “ like persistently asking but I said no.,,
"""I went to a New years party with some friends from my old school the year after we had finished school (i was 19). There was this guy who I’d had a past with & who had been wanting to sleep with me- in June of that past year he had said to me at a club “im going to fuck you by the end of the summer”. ,We kissed a few times that new years night and he was being forward with me. That night I got very drunk & high from weed. He invited me to a bathroom off this bedroom upstairs to do a laughing gas balloon. After taking the balloon I remember kissing him and then feeling very dizzy and going to lie down on the bed. I was face down and i remember him touching and starting to finger me as i passed out. The next thing i remember is waking up alone in the room and feeling a lot of pain in my vagina. I called out for my friend who came to see if I was okay. I went to the loo (which was painful) and I was bleeding from my vagina (it was definitely not my period). I was very confused and explaining to my friend what I think had happened to me, when he came back into the room - he quickly left when he saw my friend. I spoke to him on the phone the next day and he said he had left to go get a condom to “finish off”. I was mortified by this as it showed he clearly knew what he was doing. I experience pain and bleeding from my vagina for 3 days after I was raped. I still have problems sleeping and know this will affect me my entire life. ,When I was younger at school he used to make up rumours about me having sex/doing grotesque sex acts with people and would send me abusive messages saying I was a slut and making revolting remarks about my body. I had sent him nudes when I was at school which he sent round to other boys at the school. He got me to willingly give him oral sex when I was 13 and told everyone at school about it. People would regularly refer to him as creepy and a predator.""",,
"I met up with a boy who I knew as he used to go to my school but had since left. He got me really really high obviously on purpose, i was only 14 and was very panicky and he could visibly see this but instead of trying to help me or anything he began to put his hand up my skirt in the middle of the street and start touching me even after I told him to stop and then he started to put his hand in my pants and was still touching me, I was already panicking and this made me feel so uncomfortable, I was also embarrassed as people in the street were walking by and looking. I don’t think I realised this was sexual assault until a few years after because of the lack of sex education in schools, we do one lesson on consent where the boys sat through it and laughed the whole time and that’s it.",,
"I trusted this guy and there had been a long lead up to us having sex, we then had sex, but afterwards he wouldnt stop touching me and I said that I was tired so I had sex with him again hoping that we could sleep afterwards. When we finished I looked down and the condom was on the other side of the bed, I cant say for sure it was on purpose but the facts point that way. I told him the next morning I had to get the morning after and he said ok and went back to sleep.",,
I got told that I was going to be held down and gang raped by a boy at school. I'm 12.,,
"When I got to uni I was excited to make friends. There was this one guy, who I thought we were friends but had only talked a number of times, he was nice. One night he showed up to my room drunk. I was working on an assignment for tomorrow. It wasn’t abnormal for people to come and go in uni halls so we chatted for a bit before I told him to leave so I could work. He wouldn’t go and when he started kissing me I tried to laugh it off. He started taking off my clothes and I asked him what he was doing but he didn’t stop. I just thought to myself “I guess this is happening”. I didn’t put up a fight but I couldn’t at the time. The only thing I could think was that I didn’t want to be mean because he was my friend. I hate that I even thought that now. I played it off and told him to leave after and he did. I didn’t tell anyone not even my friends that we slept together. I just wanted to forget it ever happened. He left some big hickeys on my neck which I hated so much. I tried to cover them but when people noticed I just went home to avoid any questions.",,
I dated a guy for a few months when I was 20 who was 21 and had been a student at dulwich college. I was inexperienced had only slept with one other person and when I would stay round at his house which was a few times a week he’d want to have sex around 6 times or more in one day. When I’d question it he’d say it’s the “honeymoon phase” and I’ve got a high sex drive I just want to rip your clothes off at every opportunity. I’d sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and he would be inside me. At the time I saw it as a compliment that he was really attracted/into me but looking back I was definitely being treated like a sex doll and taken advantage of.,,
"I was raped by a student who transferred to my high school, but this school basically teaches girls to close their legs and cover themselves so boys aren’t tempted to do anything, so that basically implies it is the woman’s fault, and this is why I never spoke up, but I will now.",,
"When I was in middle school, a friend of mine and I went to this park that was near our school. She took me to this field house, where they held equipment for sports. To our surprise, the door was left unlocked, so like the stupid young teenagers we were, we decided to go inside. There, we started making out, which was consensual at first. As time went by, she took my hand and forced it up her shirt. She didn't ask or warn me about what was happening. I stayed silent about it, and I let it happen. I remained friends with her because I genuinely thought that what she did wasn't assault. Now, three years later, I tell another friend about this event. They were shocked to hear that she had done this, and informed me that this event was in fact assault. She had been my best friend for years, and although we aren't on speaking terms now, I still can't believe that it happened.",,
"I rode the bus during my freshman year, where I met an upperclassman. He was tall and had long hair with worn out dye in it. He would always try to grope me or throw my things on the floor so i would bend down to get it. One day he made me sit next to him, and i couldn’t go anywhere else since the bus was full, so he would feel me up and try other things. He pushed my head to the side and kissed my neck while rubbing my inner thighs. He then touched my crotch, in which i immediately pushed myself off him and left for my stop. He had his hand covering my mouth and wouldn’t let me scream. I was also groped at homecoming, but some white dude with long hair and boots, he smacked my ass and would grab my hands at random times. Every time i tried leaving he would follow me.",,
"I have been harassed online for months. Threatened of rape and more and I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t find the support anywhere, for a year I did what he wanted to stop myself from getting raped.",,
"I was thirteen and he was in the sixth form aged 17. Till this day, I can still hear him shouting when I wasn’t doing it the way he wanted me to, or to coming to school hiding bruises under my blazer because he had forced me all night. I was a child.",,
"Was on a bad tinder date. That night, he wldnt stop texting me and guilt tripping me that I wasn’t responding fast enough. I eventually told him I wasn’t interested. He sent huge texts interrogating me as to why. I blocked him when he wldnt stop but he found me on another mobile and sent there too, until I blocked again. I was disgusted how entitled he felt to my attention and my thoughts.",,
I have felt super uncomfortable with some of my male teachers. I remember turning around and wondering why my teacher was staring at me and then my friend thought that it was because i was wearing my black bra. Turns our it was. My teacher also waits for me to go up the stairs first so he could see my bunda.,,
Not as bad as some others but still not ok. In my last relationship my ex would manipulate every fight/argument to end up being my fault. After each time he would then pressure me into having sex with him “so he could feel better” and said it was the only way we could clear the air and stay together. Even when I was still upset from arguments and would make it clear I didn’t feel like it he would continue till I gave in. I felt that as a girl/girlfriend it was my job to please him sexually so didn’t realise anything was wrong.,,
In Primary School we were doing show and tell and everyone was sitting of the floor as i stood up and went to the front because it was my turn. A boy in my class put his hand up my skirt and the teacher brushed it off and told me it’s how friends played around,,
"I was 14 at the time and during the holidays would go out with some friends who were a year or so older to these large parties. At the time i wasn’t sure what to expect but they were filled with drunk 17/18 year old guys as well as people our age. For the time i was there each time i was groped by 5-10 people, then probably about another 5 a night would come up from behind me and start grabbing my waist and body rubbing themselves against me not letting go when i pushed them away, many convincing me or trying to get me to kiss or be with them.",,
A boy in my year would always come up to me while we were changing for games and he was in his pants (i’m queer). he would grab his penis etc and get really close and everyone would laugh. it seemed like it became a routine or something and it seemed to happen every week. i would tell him to stop but i kinda had to go along with it so he would stop. i’ve left now so it’s far behind me but i didn’t realise how much it affected me until i started hearing others come out about their experiences.,,
"This one guy [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] would always make comments about my body. He is my age and I honestly thought he was joking because we were kinda friends but it got to be a lot. I told him to quit multiple time and teachers have heard him and told him to quit and he didnt. I move multiple times away from [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but he would always come closer to me. Even if I was in a class he wasnt supposed to be in. And one day my friend showed me a photo that DD had sent to her boyfriend and it was a photo of my butt sitting in a chair. I wasn't doing anything, I was just sitting in chair looking at the teacher and he took a photo and sent it to someone (I feel like he sent it to multiple people but idk). I couldn't go to the dean or principal because I had no proof and I knew they would do nothing but most likely made it worse.

"I was in year 5 when there was a boy in my class who never played with anyone his own age in the playground. He was always playing with children a few years below us. In the classroom I was made to sit next to him and on a few occasions in reading/quiet time he’d put his hand on my knee/thigh while reading. I always shook my leg to get his hand off me but he always kept doing it, it was very uncomfortable sitting next to him knowing as soon as everyone was told to have reading time his hand would be on my knee or thigh. We were sat at the front of the class and it was clearly visible, I told him to stop but he never did. Another girl in my year also had the same experience of sitting next to him on a school trip and he was stroking her hair, arm, and leg. A male classmate was sat behind them witnessing it and would try to stop this by punching his arm, but this never stopped him."",I am one of many people failed by [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity].",,
"When I was 15 I was with my first ever boyfriend for 8 months . It all started well then he started telling me what to wear and who I couldn’t have on my phone . From that point on it started to get worse as I kept dating him and I never fully understood until I look back now , how fucked up the situation really was. He made me cut out all my friends (boys and girls) by sending them messages on my phone . Not only that he told me that if I didn’t stay with him and do what he said he would send an image he had of me to everyone.My first time was with him and I cried the whole time during , but he didn’t care . Now I’m 18 and I can look back on this in a much better place and I have met boys that have treated me and other girls with respect.Yet I still hear stories from girls I know that have had themselves forced upon by someone else, and I hear these kinds of things way too often . It’s so upsetting to see everyone’s own stories but I would just want people to know it’s not your fault and that YOU are the victim .No one is blaming all men ... and yes obviously any gender can commit this type of crime .However I think it is so important to recognise that the majority of rape victims are female and it is a biological fact that we generally, most of the time do not have the capacity or strength to fight back. It shocks me that in our society, someone people are punished for assault and some people just get away with it with many boys hearing about their own friends and choosing to do nothing about it.",,
"i was drunk and he was sober, he’s older and much stronger than me but when he asked if i wanted to go into another room i didn’t think about that. he’s my friends older brother and i thought i could trust him, he pinned me on the bed and i told him multiple times that i didn’t want to do anything and i said, “no” so many times. he was telling me to take my pants off and when i said no he tried to take them off anyway, i was too drunk to do anything. we were at a friends house and her parents got home so someone knocked on the door and told us that we had to leave and he finally got off me. i still think about that night everyday, i haven’t told my parents or his sister about what he did to me.",,
"someone in my school was caught masturbating in the school’s public library, during a period where the library was full. this isn’t a first offence, he’s a known pervert in the school. for years he would upskirt girls, ‘accidentally’ dropping pens in class and then looking up skirts, masturbating in lessons over his trousers, blatantly staring at girls’ bodies and way more. many times over the years this has been reported but nothing has ever been done. he still walks around the school as if nothing has happened and girls in our year group continue to feel unsafe. the fact that the school allow this behaviour and don’t punish him for it is bad, who knows what condoning this behaviour will lead to? what if he continues this behaviour later on in life and it progresses and becomes more violent? it seems so be doing so already, starting with upskirting and now public masturbation? when will action be taken? before or after he physically sexually assaults someone?",,
I am 12 years old and already i have been cat called and forced to do things i don’t want to do. I dated this guy for 5 months and it started really well until he realised anything he wanted me to do i would do. every time i used to meet up with him he used to ask for blow jobs and if he could see my boobs. i am fortunately out of that relationship but all his friends still call me a hoe and a whore for doing the things he pressured me into doing. another incident was when i was out in the city with my friends and i went to a public bathroom and this man came up to me and shoved me into a stall and lifted my shirt up and groped my boobs until i screamed and someone opened the door and arrested him. i feel like i should just let everyone here know that i am scared to wear a dress or a skirt or even shorts out now because of this and i am just 12 years old,,

My Music teacher was constantly having to pull me out of lessons because of what I know now are flashbacks but nobody recognised it because it isnt spoken about.

"The boys and the ingrained rape culture at all these private London schools (although I’m sure it spreads further than this) are undeniably the source of the problem, but it saddens me so much to look back and see how quick we l (as girls) were to join in on the male slut-shaming discourse without even taking a second to consider whether any of the sexual acts were consensual or not. There was such a strong feeling that if you stood up for yourself / another girl you would be passed off as lame or boring or a ‘feminazi’ (horrible term on so many levels) that no one dared to be *that* girl. Girls should be supported and given the agency at school to build confidence in standing up for themselves and believe /support other women, and not ‘give into’ the male chat.",,

"The first time I experienced sexual harrassment was when I was 14-years-old. I was travelling on a TFL bus in London, wearing my school uniform, and it was about 6pm. A man on the bus sat next to me and started talking to me. I tried to ignore him, and looked towards the many adults around me, hoping someone might help (it was rush hour after all). Eventually, he arrived at his stop and as he stood up to get off the bus, he turned to me and placed his body across mine. He kissed me on my lips before walking off the bus. Not one adult on the bus asked me if i was okay, and i am not sure what disappointed me more; the fact that this had happened to me, or the fact that nobody cared.",,
"I was groped in a boys boarding house by another boy 2 years older, for some time I laughed it off until it was revealed later that there were other victims of his.

We went to sit on the sofa and our other friends were in another room quite drunk and asleep. After I told him, I tried to fall asleep and he started trying to finger me. He had a girlfriend at the time and obviously knew I had a boyfriend, because they were good friends. I stopped him and just moved to another sofa, he got a bit angry and told me to come back then started blaming me for being a prude.

"I attended [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I experienced being orally raped at the age of 13 by a boy at my school. I had boys climbing under my desk to look up and take pictures up my skirt. Two boys sent messages to a group chat detailing the ways in which they would rape and abuse me for days on end given the chance. Those messages were read out to my face by their friends. There were also examples of male sports teachers touching girls’ bottoms and commenting on how lucky their boyfriends were. At the age of 15, myself and a friend wrote an email detailing examples such as sexist attitudes from teachers and sexual touching by teachers, as well as quotes from a range of teachers that I no longer remember. It also included examples of teachers seeing unacceptable behaviours by boys and doing nothing, or even laughing. The letter did not include details of the specific abuse of myself, but contained thousands of words of more general examples. We were called for a meeting with the headteacher (who is still head). He basically told us that “that’s life” and sent us on our way. He said any campaign tackling sexism would be an admission by the school that they had a problem with sexism, which he was not prepared to do, as he had to protect their reputation. We were dismissed as naïve young girls who had no idea about the real world and were essentially told to keep our mouths shut.",,
On my first day in my first job Saturday job at a large supermarket the store manager approached me in a shopping aisle (the shop was open) asked me if I was the new girl and on my replying yes he proceeded to put his hand up my skirt to grope my genitals and then walked away.

Everyone went to bed I awoke to find my boyfriends friend shoving my best friend out of the way he proceeded to remove my pyjamas and rape me without saying a word. He got off me and went to sleep. I eventually told my boyfriend what happened, my parents had me report it to which I agreed. He wasn't even charged with rape, only sex with a minor. All my friends and boyfriend said I was a liar school was hell I had to move, after he was charged with sex with a minor he phoned my boyfriend and his parents and gloated on the phone how he got away with it. I did the right thing and reported it and it got me no where - my rape apparently wasn't ""violent"" enough came down to only sex with a minor, I wasn't covered in bruises and injuries on the outside but dealing with it on the inside is hell.",,
I was in year 10. this was like my 3rd ever proper party. i got drunk and i was fading in an out of consciousness. this guy who clearly been trying to gw the entire night just kept following me and i entertained it because i hadnt experienced attention like that before. at one point i was very drunk so i sat down on the staircase and he sat down next to me. i leaned against the wall just to close my eyes and ultimately i was unconscious. he sat with me for probably about 5 minutes before he then put one of his arms around me to bring me close while shoving the other one down my top and under my bra and violently groping me for over 20 minutes maybe. people who were at the party kept walking past and kept talking and kept drinking knowing this was happening yet did not say anything about it at the time. one girl actually got my friend the one who i went to the party with and she helped get me up and got me away from him but still did not mention anything about what he was doing. it wasnt until months later i realized it was sexual assault. i was 14 and i did not know anyone there and now this guy gets to continue living his life with no guilt because no one ever made him realize what he did was wrong. yet i have live with myself everyday with the fact i have been sexually assaulted multiple times and i only actually know the names of 4 of them. the other guys have just been random people on the street. i wish our society could improve,,

"When I was in year 8 (12) I went on a school trip to France. A boy I really liked at the time was put in the same group as me for the ferry and we had to stay with our group. We went to watch a movie on the ferry and we ended up kissing, which I was fine with. He then tried to put his hand down my leggings, which didn’t want, and I kept moving his hand away from me and saying no. He grabbed my hand and put it on his crotch, and moved my hand from inside his pants. I didn’t know what to do. I tried to forget about it, without really processing what had happened. Later in the trip, we had free time and the boys were all in the girls rooms playing games and getting up to you know what. He came into my room (with 7 other people in there) and got into my top bunk bed with me. I laughed because I thought it was funny but then lights went out and I asked him to leave. He put my hand down his pants again, and I thought if I gave him what he wanted he would leave, so I gave him a handjob. He started to aggressively finger me, so hard that I started crying. He then pulled down my shorts and told me to be quiet, to not disturb the other people in my room. He raped me in my bunk bed, on a school trip, with my best friend sleeping on the underneath bunk. He left afterwards, not speaking to me again until the trip back, when he grabbed my boob round the side of the coach seat. I was assaulted multiple times on that trip, and had my virginity stolen from me. He told all of his friends that we had sex, and I am still being slut shamed about it to this day. I’m 16 now and have come to terms with what happened, but I don’t think I’ll ever get over it fully.",,

"When I was 16 I had a boyfriend in the year above. We had a weirdly rocky start but all in all at the beginning it was fine. After a few months he would literally just use me for sex. Texting me to meet, have sex, leave and not say anything. That in itself made me feel like absolute shit. He would then start to tell me horrible comments such as “that skirt makes you look fat” or refuse to acknowledge me in the hallways. After that we went out on a night out and it was the first time I was going to stay over with him. I had drunk a lot that night which I guess wasn’t the greatest of ideas but I didn’t remember how I got to his house or anything. The next morning I woke up in a room naked and he wasn’t there. I felt strange and cold. Then he came in and told me to come to his room. I followed, he then tried to have sex with me and I told him no and pushed him off. I went to have a shower and I still felt sick to my stomach at the way he was treating me. I told him I was going to leave after about an hour of being in his house in silence because he was upset I wouldn’t fuck him. By the time he drove me to the station he told me “by the way you need to take the morning after pill.” Those where the last words he said to me as I got out of the car and cried myself the way home. He then didn’t talk to me for a week. I ended it. That was the best decision I ever made.",,

"I was 16years old when i met this boy and it turned out i would spend one year in an abusive and violent relationship.,He was my first time. He was 19 and so much more experienced then I was. He took advantage of it. He raped me, force me to give him blowjobs or all other sorts of things. Through a game called truth or dare he forced me to send photos, videos or even ordered me to do horrible things. Of course when i strictly opposed to take photos of my friends he punished me. I was his rules. I could not get away and he told me that if i would he was going to kill himself and it would be my fault.,I tried to leave multiple times but he threatened me to post videos taken without my consent during sex on sites and showed up to school or in the street. I was scared but most of all i was ashamed. He made me believe it was all that I deserved and that I had betrayed all my friends and family by not saying anything.,I do believe there was love in the first months because after that i saw the shift with him become violent. He tried to kill me with a pillow laughing, slap me across the room or choke me to the point i could not breathe and he left marks on my neck. I forced myself to survive pretending everything was okay. I saw no way out.,In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], confinement saved my life. I got away and he had no way to reach me. I confessed to my mother and one very close friend to what happened to me. I dealt with post traumatic stress and i still am today one year later. Only now did i have the courage to press charges but the policemen did not take me seriously.,""You just met an asshole"" did they say laughing. One of them asked me to search for the word rape in the dictionary because being in a relationship with him made all that happened non credible. I could not believe it and felt profoundly insulted.,Whatever happened i still continued and am today still in the process of getting justice of what happened to me. He robed me of my teen years. But today as a 18year old student he gave me the strength to pursue my dreams and fight for all those people who have experienced sexual abuse. And by speaking up i hope to send courage to everyone and show that it is not your fault and that your trauma can be your strength.",,
I was with my ex boyfriend for 10 months. Over the course of those months “no” wasn’t part of his vocabulary. I never had an opinion about whether I wanted to have sex. And if I did every say no I was ignored or asked why until I gave in.,,
This is the first time I have spoke up about what it’s like to be a girl in school. If you are quiet and want to work hard you get targeted and told by boys and some girls😔 to stop being frigid and get a life - meaning have sex and be a party girl. 2 boys in the year above me follow me and push me around on the way home from school. They say it is just banter and I can’t take a joke and once made me watch while one peed in my school bag and the other one flashed. I was terrified and started crying and luckily an old man walking his dog shouted over to ask if I was ok and they both run off. It doesn’t seem like a big thing compared to what has happened to other girls but it has really scared me and I now walk to my friends house after school and then wait an hour before I go home. I haven’t told anyone I’m to scared.,,

"I never thought of myself as a rape victim. Truth is I had a relationship when I was 13. He was 24. It was online, i felt safe. When i got 15 he visited my city and he invited me to his hotel, where he said he had a gift for me. I cant remember what I said, I think I froze and went to his room. He pressured me into removing my clothes. I didnt want to, but I did it anyway. I gave in, I told him to go on. I didnt know I could say no after going this far. I was in pain, facing away and crying. but he didnt respond to that. He was very harsh and going hard. I was ashamed, angry, hurt and scared. When it was over, he told me to rest and offered me juice. His demeanor was completely different during and after the act. It seemed fake, i knew he was just trying to look nice. He wanted me to stay for longer, but I left immedially. I remember going back home, no one was there, and laying on the floor crying for hours. I felt ruined, dirty, desperate. He was acting like a great boyfriend, saying that i did very well and that its normal to hurt. he said that he will keep working on me until i stretch and then it wont hurt. The first few weeks were excrutiating. He was being all the more brutal in bed, saying that hes only doing it so it will stop hurting as soon as possible. Like he was going faster, harder, deeper and stronger for my own sake. I believed him.I thought he loved me. He convinced me that any other boy wouldnt care enough to be so thoughtful. I believed him. I trusted him. This went on for 6 years and he started slapping me, kicking me in the stomack and cutting me off from family and friends. I left him when I was 21. Im 25 now and I think I was raped and abused by a paedophile. Im still not sure. Im not sure why I froze instead of running, or why I trusted and loved him eventually. Im not sure this was assault. Maybe I just didnt say no clearly enough. Maybe my silence was taken for acceptance.",,
"When I was 13, I met a boy that would then become a family friend that I still see every summer, sadly. Two years ago (when I was 13), whilst I was lying on my front at the beach, he took pictures and videos of my breasts. He then proceeded to share these pictures and videos on various groupchats (possibly to more people than I know of). Just last summer, at night when it was dark he put his phone torch on and flashed it on my breasts, telling other men around us to look. He also made grabbing motions at them and attempted to touch them. He has repeatedly made me feel awful about myself and my body, and he took away a part of me when exposing my body to so many strangers. I hate how he makes me feel and everything he has done to me, but I also am scared to tell anyone because its not like he did anything more (other than make awful and inappropriate comments) and I fear people will tell me that I am over exaggerating. I have to see him again this summer and I am so scared that he will do something else. I constantly have to cover myself around him in fear he will try something.",,

When I was in year 7 (11 years old) I was called out in front of my whole class for having socks too high. When I asked the teacher what was wrong with this (It must be fine? It’s covering more skin) I was told it draws attention to the top of my thigh because I was wearing a skirt and I was distracting the male teachers. When I told her I didn’t have any other socks she told me that I was representing the school when I left and that they couldn’t have me walking around showing off my legs to older men. I was 11. It had never even crossed my mind that older men was staring at my legs. Stop the sexualisation of children. if male teachers can’t control themselves around young girls in skirts they shouldn’t be working at a school full of young girls.,,
"I was having sex w my ex and when I finished for the 3rd time I layed back and we cuddled for a while, after that she grabbed my dick and tried to make me have sex w her again. I said no cause obviously I didn’t want to beat again but she forced my shit in there. Does that count as rape idek?",,

"I was in school on a weekend as part of rehearsals for the school show. When walking through the sports hall with a ‘friend’ in the year above, he put his arm up the back of my shirt, feeling my bra strap. I was scared but we continued walking and then he quickly grabbed me and attempted to pull me into a storage room but I managed to hold onto the door frame. There was a good few seconds of him continuing to try pull me in, by the waist, pants and arms. I shouted at him and ran off. After gaining enough courage to tell the drama teacher what had just happened, she seemed unphased and simply explained, “boys will be boys” and he was probably “just horny”. I still to this day think about what would’ve happened if I didn’t get a good grip of that door frame.",,
I was harrased by a guy in my primary school. He pinned me against the wall on many occasions and I think he tried to kiss me aswell. We were just kids but it has stuck with me.,,
"When I gave birth, I was dragged out the birthing pool without consent, forced to lie down and given a vaginal exam without being warned or asked. I screamed to stop and she just kept her hand there. When delivering, I had my arms held down at my sides while they forced my legs into stirrups and kept putting their hands inside me, touching me. I was threatened with a ventose delivery, not asked or given a choice, threatened, ""if this baby isn't out in two minutes, I'm going to go and get the vacuum."" I delivered my baby on my own, but sustained a third degree tear, but only stitched for a second degree, during which no local anesthetic was used. I screamed and begged her to stop stitching me, and she told me I would die if she didn't do it right now. I later found out that was a lie. She also put in a husband stitch without consent or even asking. I was given the hormone injection while my head was turned, despite me explicitly saying I shouldn't have it due to reaction, and I broke out in hives all over. I told them doctor and all she said was ""oh well, it's done now."" No apology. I was denied pain relief after birth and woken every time I fell asleep, despite there being no risk. It was torture. I felt more violated and abused by them than when I had previously been raped. A room full of women and no one helped me, all because they had been offered an earlier finish time on a Friday.",,
At a party once when I was 15 I got off with a boy. When we went upstairs to keep getting off in someone’s bedroom he kept pushing my head down. At some point my dad texted to say he was nearly there so I said I had to get my stuff together. The boy said “you’re not going until you suck me off” and so I did. I did the same thing again on a separate occasion afterwards because I just felt so excited that a boy had shown interest in me. But looking back it made me feel really upset thinking about it and in the years since I’ve realised that was probably some sort of sexual harrasment.,,
I was tied down I couldn’t move it was during lunch I was asked to stay late and he did it I was only 11,,
When I was five or six I was at a friends house for a sleepover and their father had came into check on us and started touching me I woke up to him half way through and was very confused and startled I was like a deer in the headlights he finished what he was doing and I never told anyone for fear of them saying I was lying.,,
"when i was in year 8 i was sexually assaulted by my (now ex) boyfriend (let's call him Sam, fake name, obviously) . It started when we were dating and ""Sam"" continually tried (and once actually succeeded in) pulling up my t-shirt and bra so he could grope my bare chest. he also tried to pull down my trousers and underwear, including trying to rape me once when he succeeded in doing so. I was narrowly able to avoid that. Once we were cuddling under the blankets in my room while my cousins were playing on my Xbox 360 (one was 5 at the time, the other was 12, same age as me, but had a mental age of 5) and ""Sam"" grabbed my hand and made me touch him under the blankets. He would regularly pin me against the wall by my throat or hair and hit me where the bruises weren't visible or were easily explained due to my known clumsiness. He also once told me that the main reason he asked me out was due to the size of my chest. After a few months i discovered he had been cheating on me, which i refused to believe at first until i got a message from a family friend of mine (which earlier that day he had insisted we hung out with on what was supposed to be me and him taking a romantic moonlit walk) saying that ""Sam"" had kissed her. I later broke up with him after finding another girl he had been dating in the year below us (meaning she was 11) and went to his house (after i had informed his grandparents, who loved me, of his cheating) she knocked on the door, he kissed her, then i walked out from behind the corner i had been waiting and watching from behind and dumped him. After this had happened he began to suggestively touch my upper thighs in class under the table. When i reported this to student support they said they couldn't do anything because there was no evidence, but they would make a note on the system that i was not to work with him and that he wasn't permitted to sit near any female students. over the next few years i observed him sitting beside many other female students, including some of my friends, and was forced to work with him on multiple occasions, until i scared him away while breaking down a chicken in cookery in year 11.",,
"I have been raped about 3 times, and last time age 60, can you believe, in my own flat. The others were when I was about 17/19. once at knifepoint after hitching a lift with a mate in a city. Very common and dangerous in the 70.s to hitch lifts. We were so naive. The city was just beginning to be a dangerous place for women. Our poor parents, out of their minds everytime we went out, me and my friend. We never reported any of them, as we were threatened they would come and get us if we did. So all have got away with it. Last one said to my mate who came too late, that I consented. I did not.",,
so this happend when i was 11 now im 12. so what happend was my family came over to like my grandpa and cousins but only my grandpa was staying over. me and my cousins were in my room playing and my mom called me to come down so we were all going down but half way my grandpa was in my moms room and he stopped me and said to give him a hug so i went i thought it was for just so when i went in the room it was dark and he shut the door and locked it i really thought nothing of it and gave him a hug but then he started acting off (i was only wearing a t-shirt and jeans) he started to touch my bottom in a weird way he groped it i was so scared i just froze he grabbed my face and started to kiss me and i didnt move because i was too scared. he put my hands in my trousers and touched me in a way i didnt like. he did something and it really hurt me physically . then he said come sleep with me but i just said my moms calling me and went. after that he started acting weird he always touches me or gropes my breast and i hate it but i dont wanna tell my mom because i feel it will ruin the relationship between her and her father,,
Last year I was in class when i noticed that a classmate found a picture of my mother. Then a bunch of other boys joined in and kept air thrusting looking at the picture of my mother and one of them was touching his genitals. The teacher didnt seem to care he even grinned and just ignored what was happening. After class They forced me to go to the bathroom where 3 boys were holding me and slapping a ruler against my backside and the other was jerking off to the picture of my mother and he even put his semen on his phone at the end. They then held me to the ground and another boy took out a wooden ruler and they kept hitting my backside until I started crying. They then suddenly all ran away when they heard someone in the corridors and spat on me as well. I was too afraid to tell anyone this but I guess it’s the right time!,,
"When I was 13, I had a crush on a guy. This guy in the future started coercing me for nudes and this soon escalated to him coercing me for oral sex. Traumatised to this day.",,
"When I was 16 I was at this party and I only knew a few people who were there. Most of us got quite drunk, however some more than others. This boy, who i had only met that night, was very drunk. Everyone was playing a game inside, and when I got up to go to the toilet he followed me, grabbed me by the hand and lead me out into the garden. He kept telling me he wanted me to give him head, and kept putting my hand on his penis, and when I tried to push him off he only grabbed me harder. He was quite drunk and so was I, so I didn’t really know what to do or how to make him stop. The garden was quite big and had a lot of hidden places, so we were hard to see. Luckily, my friend realised I was gone for a while and went looking for me, otherwise I’m not sure how far this boy would have taken it.",,
I was 17 at a friends party. We fell asleep after on the floor. I woke up and the boy next to me had his hand in my pants thinking I was unconscious. I was so confused I made out with him to make it seem normal. The end,,
I was drinking with a bunch of older friends at 15 years of age and ended up getting taken advantage of by a 17 year old and then got felt up by a 18 year old and got called ‘lousy’ for not getting with him.To this day I still feel disgusted with myself and my cousin had been there with us aswell,,
"When i was seventeen my parents kicked me out and i was homeless , luckily i never had to spend a night on the streets. however a boy i believed to be my friend told me i could stay at his one night so i could have somewhere warm and dry ( it was the middle of november ). i was unable to stay at my boyfriends house that night so i made sure me staying there would not be a problem with him , because of the circumstances he was more than fine with it at that time. i met my “ friend “ in a city centre and he got a very long bus journey with me back to his house , i had never been to the area he lived in before. i got to his house and was greeted with a bottle of vodka which he poured himself for me. i didn’t drink much of the vodka and he started to get annoyed at that fact so i started taking big mouth fulls before going to the bathroom to spit it out so i seemed i was drinking it. after about two hours he locked his bedroom door and turned off the lights. this is when he began forcing me to do things i didn’t want to do and didn’t things to me i told him to not do. he was also aware of me having a boyfriend. i had no where to go. it was either stay at his house or sleep on the streets in an area i did not know as the busses were not on and i had no money for a taxi. he knew this and took full advantage of that fact.",,
"i was only 13 but i would have this one lesson with a few boys in my class. And they would always drop pens, books anything like that and then say to me 'can you pick that up?' expecting me to bend over and pick it up so they can see my ass. Some other boy would always tell me how i have a nice ass and grab/slap it whenever he got the chance",,
"When I was 15 I began to learn piano with a 31 year old teacher from my school who would come to my house and teach me after school. My parents were always home and he built a good relationship with both me and them. Quickly it became more than a ‘teacher/student’ relationship. He told me he gained feelings for me and I told him I felt the same. He booked us airbnb’s and he would cheat on his wife with me as he took my virginity. He then was put in prison for taking upskirts of other girls years before. It was only after he was arrested that I realised what he had done to me. We weren’t in love. He abused his position of trust as a teacher. He statutory raped me. Now, 2 years later, I finally found the strength to tell the police. They have done nothing about it since I came forward. He’s now out of prison for the upskirts and knowing that terrifies me.",,
"Around a year ago me and a group of friends were walking down a hill in school at lunch and this boy bends down and looks straight under my skirt without me realising, then he sticks his hand under trying to touch me. I went immediately to the teacher and they sent him home for his safety and expected me to deal with it.",,
"During classes, the boys (aged 17/18) would gather at the windows overlooking the younger girls (aged 13/14) when they were playing sports on the field. They would choose which of the girls were fit and which were seen as the ""to be slags"" when they are older. Some of these girls were younger than some of those boys' sisters yet they didn't understand how those comments and judgements reflected predatory behaviour and that the same respect they have for their sisters, should be the same for all girls whatever the age.",,
"At [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], you had to choose between being frigid or a slut. It was made apparent from the first few weeks which category you were in. The social ranking was based on how high you rolled your skirt, how many buttons of your blouse you undid, whether you played along with “banter”. Girls felt pressured to do all these things fit into the popular, attractive end of this scale, not to mention play along with unwanted touching, inappropriate comments and worse. Even if you did not fit into the ‘popular’ end of the scale you still had to put up with the toxic culture. There were jokes about being lesbian, unattractive, nerdy and/or flat chested, from both boys and girls. The judgement of your social place was made based on other people’s perceptions of your body or what were considered unfavourable traits for a girl, which included things like being assertive, smart or liking ‘masculine’ subjects. It breaks my heart remembering how girls in my class would feel they had to play stupid to be popular. All the girls who didn’t really know what they wanted to do studied arts subjects, and all the boys who didn’t really know what they wanted to do did engineering. These are damaging stereotypes for all sides. Everyone was typecast from year 7 and you spent the rest of your time having to live up to it.",,
i was sexually assaulted by a former student and friend multiple times then bullied out of telling someone about what happened,,
"When I was 16, my group of friends and I made friends with a boy in the year above us because he could buy us alcohol and he seemed okay. He would always touch us and have his hands on us even when we told him to get off and even though I told him I was a lesbian he tried to get me to go with him when I was drunk. We had a party at one point and my friend was drunk and he kept touching her. We kept trying to take her away but she couldn’t really move and he kept saying it was fine. He groomed our whole group.",,
"When I was 18 I went to a freshers event and it was a foam party. The night was going great and the foam started to pour onto the dance floor, as it did, visibility became difficult. Suddenly I felt a violent hand being pushed into the front of my jeans and a grasping hand at my breast. I flailed my arms and screamed but nobody heard me. As I turned I saw a man running away. I chased after him and grabbed hold- I asked the nightclub to call the police and he was arrested later at his home. He was known to the police, women had reported this behaviour before but none wanted to go to court. The system had let me down, this scarred me for life. Whenever I stand in a crowded bar or am at a concert, I am on high alert- terrified my body will be attacked. I went to court as a witness and the defence barrister for the defendant focused on what I had been wearing, how much I had been drinking... I was made to feel like it was my fault in front of a court full of people, the jury and my attacker. The jury couldn’t decide whether they believed me or not and couldn’t come to a majority verdict. A retrial was called, the way I was treated in the courtroom the first time, stopped me from testifying the second time. This monster most definitely will have attacked someone again in the same way or a worse. I failed future victims as his victims before me had- but had it been implicit in the court room that what I was wearing did not matter- I wouldn’t have failed future victims.",,
"He was my first boyfriend. After a few weeks he kept asking me to send because ‘all his friends girlfriends were sending him nudes’, I felt so pressured and i didn’t want him to be mad so I sent. I was scared to go to his house because I knew he would try something.",,
"I remember being placed in a children’s home as home was not safe for me to remain there. I was 14. The boys living there would do anything they could to get me alone. If I left the room they would follow and proceed to grope my genital area and breasts. Even got to the shower and returning to my room, I would have to search under my bed and the wardrobe as I had caught them watching me undress. You see it’s not just happing at schools it’s also happening in care homes. I’m currently in the process of taking my local authority to court for the trauma I experienced which still effects me to this day",,
On multiple occasions boys from this school have groped and touched me in inappropriate places. When I called them up on it the next day they claimed they were drunk and don’t remember and that I didn’t tell them that I was uncomfortable. I did tell them and they wouldn’t listen. I wish boys understood that the excuse of ‘I was drunk’ isn’t valid.,,
"A boy at my school who i allowed to come to my house to innocently hang out would repeatedly about 5 different times touch me unconsentually on my crotch. i had told him to stop, that i didnt want too, ""no"", etc. he would then ""apologize"" over text when he got home saying he didnt realize and that he couldnt help myself. i was also harrassed by him to send nudes for almost 2 years. i didnt realize how bad our relationship was because he gaslighted and manipulated me and made me feel like i needed him.",,
"when I was only 14, and only a freshman I was dating a 16-year-old Junior who had made sexual advances to me before we even had a relationship. I thought it was normal because I have been sexualized for multiple years before hand. This Junior would grab me, or make me grab him. And he would play it off as he is my boyfriend and I am obligated to do so, or he is obligated to do so. One day in school at the end of the day like we normally meet up, he grabbed me by the throat and choked me against the wall after I told him to stop and gave him many signs to stop. Many teachers walked by saw it and did not do anything, I no longer feel safe at school.",,
"I'm very aware my story is very mild compared to other testimonies, but I still wanted to share - I went on a tinder date with a guy after a horrible breakup, and a week later I invited him round, and made it clear by message ""There's no guarantee I'll want to have sex with you, I just want a cuddle"". I now realise he saw that as a challenge - we got into bed and he started kissing me for the first time, and i thought ""yeah fine, fair enough"", and then he started touching me sexually, and I pushed him, off, which might also would have been ""fair enough"", except that he was so persistent and kept trying to ""turn me on"" throughout the night, it was disgusting. To the point where he'd put his hand on my breast, I tried to push him off, but he tightened his grip and resisted me pushing him off. It was disgusting that he didn't care that I didn't want to have sex with me, he only cared that he wanted to have sex with me and he was aiming to wear me down until I said yes. I partly felt it was my fault for inviting him round and ""leading him on"", even though I made it clear I didn't exactly want to have sex with him, and not telling him to leave cause I felt 'bad' of how he'd get home late at night (??)",,
"I was having a rough time at my uni in my first year, and I had a friend who was a second year at another uni. He suggested I come and stay for the weekend. He kept trying to hit on me, and eventually I gave in and kissed him back but told him I didn’t want to do anything more. I rolled over and tried to sleep. I keep hearing him make weird noises and the covers moving. He then went to the bathroom and I realised he was w*nking. He had been next to me in bed the whole time, and then afterward when he came back he did it again. I pretended to be asleep but I felt so sick and trapped. I left on the first train in the morning and blocked him.",,
Girls are constantly asked for nudes and they are pressured into sending them. If a girl gives in due to the pressure her nudes then get sent around the school or sent to an ‘all boys group chat’ and are then compared with other girl’s nudes.,,
"I was at a party and had a few drinks and a close guy friend that I previously trusted dragged me outside and started kissing me I said no because I didn’t want to and we were friends, he pushed me down on the ground and straddled me so I couldn’t get away despite me trying to get free. I kept saying I didn’t want this and telling him to stop kissing me, he then forcefully fingered me so hard that it hurt and I was saying no the whole time. Then after 5 minutes he just got up and left then slut shamed me to our whole friendship group a week later. Another time with a different boy who I had previously been in a relationship with, we were at a friends house drinking there were 5 of us and I was the only girl. He took me outside and told me his new girlfriend wasn’t as good as me and he missed me and still loved me and that I should get with him one last time, that it would be special, I was drunk and still in love with him so I agreed to kiss him. He then forced me to give him oral despite me saying no then he held my head down and kept pushing me, making me do it till I cried. Another boy tried to coerce me and a few months later my friend into having sex with him, he then had a separate conversation with another friend saying how he thinks it’s okay to convince someone to have sex with you even if they have repeatedly said no.",,
"I was 16 and had just started going out with a boy in the year above. He was super pushy about doing sexual stuff and I was pressured by all of his friends to have sex with him way earlier than I was prepared to. We pretty quickly moved into some intense BDSM stuff, which ended with him telling all of his friends everything we had done in explicit detail while I begged him not to. I had people shouting explicit stuff at me around school because of this. The physical abuse began shortly after, but because I allowed him to hit me during sex this was just part of it. One time when he came to see me during the holidays I was experiencing a bad period and asked him to not have sex. He refused to speak to me the rest of that day, and I woke up in the middle of the night that night to him having sex with me. I told my housemistress about it when I returned to school for advise and she dismissed it as just part of a relationship. He frequently coerced me into sex, forced me down as “part of the sex” and wouldn’t let me leave rooms until he had finished. I know since we have broken up he has told people all about our sex life, but I’m sure no one knows he raped me over 15 times.",,
One of the boys in my class said he wanted to play the fire truck game and the teacher said nothing and told me off for shouting at him,,
"Me and all my friends have so many stories about [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] that we’ve literally blocked out until reading all this to remind us. I remember being 16 and slept over with some friends after a party. One of my girl friends, one boy and I all slept in one bed. I was half asleep and felt him touching me, on my chest and under my jeans. I felt uncomfortable but felt too awkward to say something and didnt want to ‘make a fuss’- eventually he stopped and I felt so uncomfortable but acted like nothing was wrong the next morning",,
i was only 15.. my friends were in the other room and he has done it twice since then.. everyone has taken his side and it hurts me so badly.. I don’t think i’ll ever be the same or be able to have my feelings be displayed like that again as they were for him and it just hurts that he gets to walk free...,,
"I was at an after school club and all the boys had to get changed in the same little changing room, after pretty much everybody got changed there was me (a year 7 at the time) and two year 11 boys. One started showing one there area and then said 'do you want to see', I didn't reply and kept facing the wall. Next thing I know he is behind with his part out trying to turn me around and trying to get me to touch it. Fortunately I was just about done getting dressed so I ran out but as I left I heard 'Aw you probably scared him'. Roughly a year later I found out he was on the sexual offender list and all what it would of took was for me to speak up for him to be gone, and to be honest it wasn't even big.",,
"i was 13, she was my best friend, she coerced me into playing a 'game' who can turn who on first without hands. she made me feel so guilty for saying no. she pinned me down on her bed. she told her mum it was all me. she told a load of people different stories about us just so she could say it was my view of it & i was a lier. now she's in my friend group again, i still want to cry everytime she comes near me. I've only told a few people but they're still friends with her. i feel dirty",,
"When I was 15 at a house party a boy and I were drinking. He was being generous with his vodka but I remember him holding the bottle up to my mouth encouraging me to drink a lot. I was having fun however I told him I had to find my friend as I had no other way of getting home. He told me he believed her to be at the near by park, we get there and it's absolutely empty and now I'm very drunk. We sit on a bench and we kiss which I felt comfortable with, until he asked for sex. I said no, he pressured me and continued. He forced himself upon me and I screamed and freaked out which must have frightened him. He left me sobbing, drunk and alone without my pants on in a park in the middle of the night. I was lucky a group of people that had also been at the party found me and I made it home safely.",,
"I was walking home from school and had a big rip down the back of my tights which had grown in the day, I walked past a pub on my way home and these 4 drunk men who were sitting outside shouted at me and whistled, I was so angry so I turned around and just said 'what the hell?!' but that just made them all laugh, even the waiter was standing next to them laughing (and I walked so fast round to my house and felt so ashamed)",,
"In december 2019, i became friends with a dude (let's call him A). A seemed super nice an sweet at first. We became friends instantly but then things started to go down hill. A would constantly sexualize me and ask me for nudes.(i am a minor and so is he but it still doesnt mean its okay) A also would do the same thing to other girls (i know this because he sent me the pictures of the girls and told me to send a a$$ pics.). A also thinks its funny to make rape jokes.",,
I was 12 and him also. We were in the same class but we never really talked much. Everyone in class used to make fun of because he liked me. I thought it was just an innocent crush I didn't think anything of it. In school we had something called guardian angels and I picked his name out.The game is that who ever's name you pick out you have to be extra kind to them and at the end of the week they have to guess who there guardian angel is.So near the end of the week he called me to go into an empty room with him so I agreed.I didn't think anything of it the n he pinned me against the wall and kissed me I left the room and told a teacher she told me she would talk to him and thats the last I heard of it... they never asked for details or anything I pretty sure they did nothing I've been assaulted in this school twice and nothing was ever done about it,,
"I had just turned 16, and my boyfriend was staying round at my house to spend the night. We slept in separate rooms. The night before, he had been asking and asking for sex, but I didn’t want to, so I said no several times and he walked out of my room angry without even saying goodnight. Then, the next morning, he came in while I was asleep, pulled down my clothes and began to rape me. I woke up whilst it was happening, but i was half asleep and in shock. I didn’t know what to do so I just stayed as still as possible. When he was finished with me he just turned over and left me there. I was completely in love with him, and refused to believe that he would do this to me, so I went on for a month and convinced myself it never happened. I broke up with him after about a month, I was so confused myself and it was only when I told a friend that I realised just how serious it was. It has been 9 months since it happened and I am still in therapy.",,
Throughout my first 3 years of secondary school me and many of my friends were regularly shouted sexual abuse at and groped by many of the boys. We all became so used to this which is really upsetting.,,
"I was 15 at the time and went to see my boyfriend and he wanted me to give him head but I was too tired and refused. After multiple times of him asking me repeatedly and trying to force my hands, I kept refusing and so he started touching himself whilst still getting with me and touching me up. I never felt so uncomfortable in my life and was waiting for the moment to stop. I never even told my friends until a year later because I did not even realise how bad the situation was and because it was disgusting to even think about.",,
"When i was at secondary school and the class used to line up waiting for the teacher so we could go into lesson, sometimes boys would walk along the line and grope girl's breasts or pull up their tshirts so they could look at their bra. I was scared they would try to do it to me so I would wait until the lesson started before going there. One time, I was waiting with my friends there and one of the boys came and groped two of my friends and my friends didn't say anything. They tried to grope me but I moved away. I asked my friends why they didn't try to make it stop and they said they were scared that the boys would try to fight with them. I reported it to a teacher but she said it was probably just fun and games and wasn't a big deal so nothing was ever done about it.There was one boy who was a bit older than us who would come up behind girls and put his hand down the neck of their shirts and grope their breasts, or pull up their skirts and pull down their underwear really fast before running away laughing. Sometimes he would try to pullup my bra to make my boobs fall out and I hated it and tried to avoid him. I also never wore skirts because they would get pulled up.",,
"when i was 11-12 a boy in my school repeatedly asked me to send and all that and he made it seem like such a good idea and at the time i thought it was cool😐, he then told me about how him and his friend made it a competition to see who could get the most pics they’re gross. there must have been like 20 girls.",,
"One student decided to jerk off in class, the teacher saw it and the whole class. All the school did was put him into reconnect for 1 day, because he said ‘I didn’t do it’ i hate the way this school handles sexual stuff it’s sad. Loads of teachers don’t tell popular girls off for having their skirt too high up because they want to look under it. The female staff is the only one to do it",,
"A boy repeatedly asked if I loved him, if he could see my breasts and tried to kiss me.",,
"A male teacher at school- During online schooling, this specific teacher would only ever called the female students to attend the lessons, he never rang anyone else. He used to creep up behind me in class and rub my back then whisper in my ear. He would say things like “you can always talk to me you know”, yet i was never in any distress and i had just been trying to do my work so it always confused me why he would say things like that. He did this regularly, and sometimes even brushed my hair away from my ears before he would whisper into them. When i would try and shift away, he wouldn’t resist movement instead he would then ice me out. He wouldn’t help me when i asked and he wouldn’t answer me when i put my hand up. It made me feel as though i had done something wrong. However, i never thought too much of this odd behaviour until he started commenting on the length of my skirt; no other teacher nor pupil had ever taken an issue with it before so i was confused. he would call on me to “pull it down to an appropriate length” and to “leave things to the imagination” in front of the whole class leaving me to feel very embarrassed. He also set up interventions sessions but kept me separate from the rest of the class, he always tried to get me to attend them just one on one. This would be fine if i actually needed it, but i didn’t. All i had to do was stay behind to finish some coursework i could easily do at home and/or in a group setting. One time he had told me and a few other female students about how his penis is uncircumcised. This left us all to feel very uncomfortable. I know this behaviour is nothing bad, however i do feel as though it just needs to be made known that it is discomforting and not appropriate to carry out, especially in a school setting. Just because this is some actions of one male teacher does not mean he is the only one. In fact, i have witnessed many members of staff carry out this sort of behaviour towards students too, so it needs to be addressed.",,
"I went to a school in central Essex from the late 80s to the mid 90s. It was considered normal to male sexist and sexual comments and jokes, and that went as far as guys touching girls. We were expected to laugh it off, and as part of the ""lad culture"" then it was normal for guys to try it on. IT wasn't limited to school, it was part of the wider culture. You just got used to being touched up all the time, and if you had an issue with it, everyone would see you as the problem. As we were leaving the school, I had a boyfriend who was going to study aboad for a year. I agreed to sleep with him before he went, and then he would stay with me and we'd continue to be a couple when he got back. When the night came - it was a Monday, I remember it well- I decided I didn't want to and said no. He cotninued anyway and forced himself on me. I was scared. This is what girlfriends let their boyfriends do, wasn't it? When he finished, it was like nothing had happened. I felt guilty about making it difficult for him. I guess I still do at some level. It turned out that when he was away, he was writing to me but with lots of other people. He didn't so much as dump me as write to me about his new girlfriend who he'd been with for a while by then. I've never told my girl friends about what he did as I thought they'd blame me for leading him on or not being clear enough with him. They know something happened. I still have nightmares about it. One of them asked me outright recently and I still couldn't say yes. I'm scared of ruining his reputation because he made a mistake but more than 25 years later, it still haunts me.",,
I had images shared of me naked online,,
"I had a guy look up my skirt and then brag about it to all his friends who then started bullying me for it at this school, the school did nothing about it and I still had to be in classes with him, it got so bad I was eventually put into counselling because I was suicidal, and also a very close friend of mine was groped by a pupil at this school",,
"When visiting my home town and one of my oldest friends, we were out drinking and met some guys. I ended up with one of them under my favourite childhood tree, but as things got more sexual I said no and tried to push him away but he didn’t stop. My body and mind just froze and I was raped. From there I came in and out of consciousness, blacking out eventually. I don’t know if it was from shock, being roofied or drinking. I thought it was only 5/10 minutes max but my friend later told me that I was gone for 40 minutes. I felt the pain for days after, struggling to walk or sit normally or painlessly. I went to the police but they advised against going to court as they said most likely nothing would happen. This was my first sexual experience, outside, during Storm Ciara, and left me suicidal with PTSD and depression.",,
when i was 15 i dropped something off to my parents and i was in my pajamas- on the walk home from the bus stop three men pushed me down and while two of them held me down the third one raped me. i never felt able to speak up because i knew people would say i was ‘asking for it’ or that i shouldn’t have been alone that late at night and no matter what the truth was i would be blamed,,
"This happened when I was in year 8 at the time, me and my 4 friends were waiting in the school playground for the morning bell to ring so we could go inside (we all came to school somewhat early so there was barely anyone on playground). We were talking about random stuff and then this guy came to our group and started talking to us. I barely knew the him but my friends considered him a part of our group. He was perfectly normal and fine but then started talking about explicit stuff that made all of us very uncomfortable, so then my friends started walking away I was going to leave with them but this same guy cornered me and wouldn't let me leave. He corned me in a place where no one could see us and it was just us then he started to grope me around the chest, it didn't last long. But I was stunned and could barely register what happened I just stood there completely frozen. After he left I never told anyone about what happened to me and somehow I went about like everything was normal. It wasn't until now I realised what actually happend to me that day.",,
The boy behind me in the fire drill grabbed my ass and my teacher wouldn’t let me move away,,
Got sexually assaulted by a boy in my class and i was just trying to do my work,,
I know of people who have been groped in the corridors on the way to lessons. One time in English I was asked invasive questions about my body by male peers. Guys openly in classes talk about what they want to do to girls in a highly sexual manner including the talk of rape and who they would want to rape.,,
"This dudes friend told me he has a crush on me so i was like ‘ohh that’s cool haha’ and stuff but as the days went on his friends told me some things he had said about me and had video evidence of him saying it, he said things like ‘oh i want to bend her over and f*ck her till she can’t walk’ or ‘i want to see what she’s wearing under her clothes’ and some stuff about seeing me nude and in my underwear.",,
Inadequate teaching or safeguarding of children online resulted in sexual abuse from a paedophile predator between 14-17 years old. There was also little understanding of mental health and all boarding schools must learn to look out for signs. This affects me to this day after ongoing threats and police investigations while at university causing my mental health to severely suffer.,,
My ex boyfriend sexually assaulted me while I was sleeping numerous times throughout our relationship. He was also physically and verbally abusive.,,
"I was at a party and he kept trying to kiss me and coming up behind me and touching my neck and I was getting really upset. He then got aggressive with some guy (unrelated to the way he was literally going around sniffing girls and stuff) and because I was literally the only sober one, I decided to intervene. He then proceeded to punch me hard under my chin with multiple witnesses. Nobody believed me the next day and I lost so many friends because they sided with him. I haven’t been able to enjoy a party since",,
"When I was 18 I accidentally got really drunk on a night out. I remember a boy I didn’t know taking me back to his room and taking off all my clothes and having sex with me (without protection) whilst I laid there going in and out of sleep/consciousness. I remember feeling so scared, uncomfortable and violated but I was too drunk to get up or do anything about it. A week later I found out he had taken pictures of me naked and passed out on his bed and shared them on a boys group chat. I felt so ashamed and never told anyone or did anything about it.",,
"when i was 15 i had a 20 year old add me on snapchat pressuring me to send him nudes, when i repeatedly said no and made it very clear that i didn’t not want to send nor receive nudes he sent them anyway, he then threatened me if i didn’t send them back and i felt like i had no choice but to do it. i regret it everyday.",,
"My mum’s family live in a Western European county and sometimes I feel like feminism hasn’t arrived there at all. I’m aware that this maybe doesn’t even count as harassment but I get panic attack every couple of months when a story like Sarah Everard’s reaches the news or I see the guy who did it again. On Boxing Day when I was 14 I was groped by my cousin who was 17/18 at the time. I had just gotten out of the shower and was wearing jeans and a hoodie with wet hair and no makeup on. I feel the need to include this as harassment and sexual advances were always explained to me as a result of a woman’s clothing choices which is why it took me such a long time to get over this- because it didn’t fit my idea of sexual harassment. As I walked past him he groped my arse and whispered something to me. I can’t remember what he said but I know it was deeply sexual because I blocked it out immediately after being too disgusted and shocked to move or react. This groping has haunted me for years. I told my sister who experienced the same thing as me from the same cousin which confirmed to me that I hadn’t imagined it. Neither of us have told anyone else as he is heralded as the genius of the family whilst my sister and I are quite but still intelligent. What cemented this experience as marking was how afterwards his younger brother, who is my age, stood next to me for the rest of the day to protect me - I think he saw what happened as he made a few comments about how the older brother was standing very close to me. I still have mixed emotions about this part: happy that the cousin my age protected me but also the fact he suspected what happened and didn’t seem surprised horrifies me. That evening we went out to a nice restaurant where I was sat next to my uncle who is the father of these two cousins and repeatedly asked me to kiss him on the cheek throughout the meal which made me really uncomfortable and I didn’t feel able to say no as this would’ve created an uncomfortable environment. I hate the fact that I’m still so affected by that day, that I still haven’t said anything, that I didn’t have enough confidence at the time to just say no. I have no idea whether the older cousin even realised what he did was wrong when his family all support these attitudes towards women. I think about it all the time and I’m still terrified of being stuck in a room with him. I’m petrified of anyone doing anything sexual with me as a result of this. It’s been years and I can’t even muster up the courage to use a tampon as every time I try all I can think about is that day. It was years ago and it affects me daily even though it was only a grope.",,
"this year in February a boy at school followed me to the bathroom and tried to make me go in with him, I said no but then he said follow me outside, I did. I realize now it was a mistake. He grabbed me and tried to pull me in a bathroom, he pulled on my jacket and my wrists and he grabbed me inappropriately, I ran away. I was free. I came forward about it and I was bullied. I still am to this day.",,
At my school there is a boy who likes to grope girls at parties without their consent and he is pretty well known for it. A video was made recording some of the time he did it but the guys in the year thought it was funny and still laugh about it even though it grosses many of the girls out and makes them feel uncomfortable.,,
"I was in a sexually abusive relationship and because it was my first relationship and I was quite naive about what sex should be like, it took me ages afterwards to come to terms with it having been so awful and even still I don’t feel ready to call it rape. I was so scared of outright saying no which really makes me blame myself for it, even though I was clearly in pain seeing as I was completely frozen, silent and unresponsive at best and sometimes crying. Sex was incredibly painful and I had 0 agency but I kind of thought this was how it was meant to be and part of my ‘duty’ as someone’s girlfriend. I’d known this person for a really long time and completely trusted them so I think I also didn’t want to allow myself to consider that they might want to hurt me. I was frequently coerced and manipulated and forced into sex but I wanted so desperately for this person to be a good person so I didn’t let myself think about it. I now can’t sleep properly in my own bed because I feel like I’m in danger, especially in certain positions, and because of once waking up with him inside of me I often wake up in the night panicked and crying feeling as though I’m in imminent danger. I have PTSD and panic disorder as a result of all of this and I am constantly on edge. The presentation of rape which tells us it’ll be a stranger with a weapon on a rainy night in an alley (which obviously happens and is horrific but only accounts for 10%) is SO dangerous; when we are taught not to think people we know are capable of these things it makes it a lot harder to identify it and come to terms with it and get out of a really horrible situation.",,
"When I was in first year (11/12 years old) I was bullied a lot, and I had a boyfriend that I was really attached to. I was constantly scared that he would dump me and I wouldn't have anyone because I was bullied a lot. He would take advantage of this, and so one time he asked me to send him a nude photo of my boobs. I found one on Google images and sent that, but he insisted I sent one with my face in it so he would really know it was me. I was hesitant to do so, but he convinced me to and he promised he would delete it. We broke up soon after that. Many months later my photo was all over Facebook and I had loads of messages telling me that I w slut etc. They would also make fun of the way my boobs looked. One of my bullies at school told me she hoped I would be the next Amanda Todd. Eventually the photo was taken down and I moved to another school. Soon after I moved I found out that one of my bullies' cousins went to the new school, and so the photo was sent to her and it was threatened to be posted again at the new school, but this time I went to a guidance teacher to prevent it from happening.",,
"I stayed in a hotel room with a friend as i couldn’t go home because it was too late. he was 21, i was 17. He pushed the beds together after i had passed out and i woke up in the middle of the night to him having sex with me. I woke up in so much pain but i froze and pretended to be asleep as i was too scared as to what would happen if i retaliated. He drove me home the next day and blocked me. He gave me an std.",,
"I went to a daycare where I was touched by a 17 year old male while I was only 8 years old. He would pretend to tickle me and inappropriately touch my crouch, but I didn’t know. Of course I didn’t know though. I was so young. I’m a guy btw, and I don’t know why this hurts so bad to type. I told my dad and he was charged with sexual battery but hardly got any jail time.",,
"A boy who I slept with once told his mates whilst I was standing right there that ‘I gave the best blow job’, whilst proceeding to grope my boobs and bum for the rest of the night.",,
"I was chatting with this boy from school when I was 15. He seemed really nice. I just got out of my first “real” relationship where I experience physical and emotional abuse, such as gaslighting, love bombing, choking whenever I tried to walk away. Then he cheated on me and called me crazy to ruin my reputation so if I spoke up no one would believe me. So I was kind of already in a bad spot mentally when I was chatting with this guy. I just wanted a friend. I made that very clear from the get go. Finally he asked if I wanted to watch a movie with him so we could talk in person, and I said yes. I was so naive. He came over to my place, because I wanted to have a bit more power in the situation in case he tried anything. Then he started to try and kiss me. He then asked for sex. I said no. Not once. Not twice. But over and over and over again. He then held me down. Not only did he take away my comfortability with my self and I couldn’t even look at myself for years because I thought I deserved it. But he made me feel unsafe in my own house, anytime I’d go into the basement where it happened I’d immediately get thrown back like it happened yesterday and I’d be depressed for a week. Eventually I made myself believe that it wasn’t my fault and I didn’t deserve it and I was able to move past that traumatic experience.",,
This is one of the worst schools to go to if you’re s/a it happened my freshman year there and I was raped during finals week. The teachers didn’t care they only care about what your grades were and that’s it. When I needed support the most nobody was there.,,
"At [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] a bunch of boys in year9/10 (now in year12) had what they called a ‘wank bank’. Where they had received nudes from girls (that were sent under the impression made by the boy that the boy would not share the nudes with anyone). These boys then took photos of these nudes on another device (without the girls permission) and would ‘trade’ the nudes around their year, creating a large collection of girls nudes that each boy would have. Some of the girls nudes who were spread around, didn’t even know who the boys were who ended up with their nudes on their phone. When confronting the boys on the issue, they blamed the girls claiming that it’s ‘their fault for sending’ and that they’re ‘sluts’ they also proceeded to mock the girls that were standing up for themselves",,
When I was 14 I invited my ex boyfriend of a year over as we had recently become friends again and having known him for 3 years I trusted him. We walked my dog in the park returned home and started watching a film he then took it upon himself to place his hand on my breast after I pushed his hand away and he persisted I got up and said that he should probably leave to catch the bus I was clearly uncomfortable but he persisted again taking my first kiss from me in my doorway also without consent pulling me onto his lap and holding me there other hand on my chest I could feel him go hard it made me feel sick I managed to force him out of my house a little after that. A year later at 15 I was meeting with friends at a guys house I was the last one to leave we were sat on the sofa he told me to lie on his chest as I was tired and I noticed his hand creep down my chest rest on my breast and squeeze I also pushed his hands away he also persisted his hands even went to between my legs over my trousers before I left feeling violated. All this happened before I even turned 16.,,
"I was at a party when I was 16 and was sitting on a bench with my friend and some guys I knew of and had spoken to a few times before. One of them kept shoving his face close to mine but I didn’t really pick up on it since I had had a few drinks and was slightly tipsy. Suddenly he leant over me and started kissing me while getting on top. I pushed his chest to get him off but he was strong and I guess didn’t feel it or chose to ignore it. I kind just lay there for 5 mins letting him kiss me and as soon as it was over I got up and went to text my friend about what had just happened. He started following me and trying to look at my phone and then later when I was dancing with my friend he kept trying to touch me and make moves on me again when I clearly didn’t want to do anything. Later I felt really upset about it as it was a first kiss that I had actively avoided doing with anyone since I wanted to save for someone I liked, but while this guy kissed me I just froze and didn’t feel anything.",,
When I was 14 a boy -who I would have trusted with my life at the time- started touching me while I was drunk and half asleep in bed. I told him to stop and I asked him to move but he told me it was fine and continued. I don’t remember the details of what happened that night as I was in and out of consciousness but I do remember the fear and the sadness that I felt as he was doing stuff to me. Nobody took me seriously when I spoke to my friends about it at the time so I forced myself to believe that it wasn’t an issue. (Through reading these testimonies I have come to terms with what happened to me and while I have moved on and no longer let it define who I am it has helped me to feel less alone so thank you. ),,
I was at an afters were I started talking to this guy and we got along and started kissing. I was drunk and high and we went upstairs and threw me on a bed and started undressing me. I can’t remember much but we had sex and I still don’t know whether it was with consent or not. Then he took me back to his and all I remember is waking up and he had tied my hands to the end of his bed and was penetrating me. I asked him to stop but then he put his hand over my mouth and continued.,,
"I went to a party last year. I was with one friend and I didn’t know anyone else there. I decided to start socialising and being friendly with one guy in particular. I made it very apparent that I had a boyfriend just incase, because I wanted to protect myself. Apparently that wasn’t enough protection, I needed to go to the bathroom so I asked the guy to help me find it. Next thing I knew once I came out of the bathroom and put my phone on charge, he had ulterior motives. He attempted to rape me and took advantage of me knowing fully well that I was incredibly drunk and chose to disrespect that I was in a relationship with someone else. If it wasn’t for my friend coming into the room and pulling him off me, I don’t know how much longer I would’ve been there participating in something I never wanted to participate in. I was completely frozen, and I know so many of you would want to say that I could have gotten up or started screaming and shouting. But in that moment I feared for my life, I didn’t know what consequences my reactions would have. If I screamed maybe he would hit me, I couldn’t do or say anything. I was scared to even breathe. Thank you for letting me share my story.",,
"I was 11 when multiple boys in my class would touch me inappropriately and make comments on my body, I am now 14 and this is still continuing outside of school and i am now away from those boys.",,
"Me and this male teacher used to be together a lot because I struggled with work a lot and one day I was really struggling with my prep so I told him and he said he would help me after school so I went to him after school and I told him the question and once I understood it he congratulated me but before I could get up he put his hand on my thing and moved it upwards then starting to touch me I was so scared I didn’t do anything"",This may seem rude but screw anyone who thinks that women and men are equal, when I have to deal with men feeling brave and comfortable enough to say derogatory things to me and touch me without my consent. Fuck anyone who thinks that the world is equal.",,
"When I was in year 7, a couple of dudes who were in year 9 at the time kept calling me ""sexy"" apparently because ""they thought it made me feel good"" while I would burst into tears in front of them, and kept running from them, and it caused a good breakdown or two. It took my mother threatening to take me out of the school for them to act on it. Even then the school originally went ""They wouldn't do that"". Everytime I look back, I still can't explain ""why"" to myself, why it originally wasn't taken seriously.",,
"I was visiting a new friend's hometown at Christmas after my first term in uni. I got drunk and put myself to bed in the room I'd been allocated. Her brother came in lay down next to me, woke me up and just kept pestering me. ""Come on, just a wee kiss"". I ignored him for a long time but finally relented, basically because I was tired and drunk. His friend who was trying to sleep in the room just shouted, ""oh for f**is sake"" and left the room. His nickname was ""the rapist of Hackney"". Apparently this was his modus operandi. A few years later almost the same thing happened with him, I drunkenly fell asleep on a friends sofa when I was supposed to be sleeping in another friends house. He pestered me again, for what felt like ages. ""Come to my bed, it'll be comfier"" I relented and went with him again, I was tired and drunk. Thank god I was wearing tights because I could remember in the morning that nothing else had happened. I don't speak to those friends anymore, partly due to the fact that I was seen to have chosen him over them.",,
"I am a boy with friends who encourage girls towards me and myself towards girls. One evening at a party, some close girls friends of mine began lifting my shirt, running their hands over my chest, and touching my face, as a joke I thought. My friends sat beside me watching it happen, expecting me to enjoy it, but I didn't one bit, I wanted to leave but felt social pressure so strong that if I left everyone would hate me or think I was gay. One kissed me and another went and put their hand down my pants. These girls continue to be some of my closest friends. I am in year 9.",,
On multiple occasions I have been sexually assaulted by a group of boys from wetherby. Every time I would call them out on it saying I was uncomfortable their excuse would be I was drunk I don’t remember. They weren’t drunk off one beer. They remember what they did and their friends remain silent about it.,,
"I remember chatting to my friends and feeling a hand on my back trying to undo my bra, as a knee-jerk reaction I elbowed the guy (who was in the year above and I sort of knew) and he then proceeded to call me a whore along with another slew of insults. This was in secondary school and I was fourteen at the time. Fast forward to college and I had already shut down a load of fake Skype accounts pretending to be me. This account would talk about other women (and myself) in revealing clothing. At first I didn’t think much of it, but eventually I had to report multiple fake Facebook and Snapchat accounts along with a pay as you go telephone number. This went on for years and turned into online stalking (in fact it has only just stopped for me). I later learned that this person (who I had been close friends with) had not only targeted me, but also around 20 other women. When I first reported this to the police (around 2014) they were not interested as I wasn’t being ‘threatened’, however I am pleased to say that the police have taken this case on. Also in college I dated a guy who tried to guilt me into having sex. I wasn’t having any of it be as I had already said that I wasn’t ready. He would get all stroppy and completely ignore me or he would make me feel guilty for ‘ruining his day’. One night he turned up at my house (my parents were away so my friend was staying with me) and refused to leave. I was wearing a popper dress at the time and he kept yanking it apart to reveal my underwear-it was mortifying. He then started shouting at my friend whilst she was helping to cover me up. Eventually we managed to get him to leave but I ended up staying with my aunt and uncle as I was scared he would come back.",,
"i am so use to random guys sending me nudes ever sense i was like 10, i’m 15 now it’s very triggering for me.",,
i was touched on my thigh and i didn’t like it .,,
My ex boyfriends group of friends used to have a competition as to how many girls nudes they could get and would prove it by sending them to a group chat.,,
Got touch in my area when I said no,,
In my school there is a group of boys who go to parties and literally feed vodka into you. When you are really drunk they will all try to make out/ touch you when you are clearly past the point of consent and they know this. Even after this party that this had happened to me at I continued to hear stories about that night. It was horrible. There’s one despicable boy in particular who litterally deserves to be put away.,,
"It was during 7th grade, he was a new friend and we became close real quick. We had after school programs and we stayed with our friends. The rest of the day was fine until one day. Me and him we’re usually the last ones off the bus since we lived in the other side of the city. Well I would sit by myself, and he came and started saying “you should be my girl instead” then tried grabbing my thighs and tried to unbutton my shirt. We were in 7th grade! He was way bigger than me so I was scared and didn’t know how to react, I just tried to ball myself and avoid him. This happened twice until I finally had the courage to tell another girl in the bus to sit with me so that we could stop “annoying” me. I told my best friend and she told me to tell the principal, but I refuse because I was scared that no one would believe me. (This has happened when I was groomed and almost raped as a child, no one believed my story because I was little and didn’t understand). To this day only 4 people know and that doesn’t include my parents.",,
when i was just 7 years old. the first time was when a boy cornered me in the bathroom and manipulated me into..stuff. he was moved class and given star of the week a week later. i hate that god damn school.,,
"I was 11 years old the first time boys started to grope me in class. This was part of their bullying. They would grab my crotch and try to put their hands down my trousers. When I told my teachers and my parents, I was told to ignore it, they probably liked me, it set me up for years of abuse that I dealt with silently, because I’d been told to ignore it. This was 1996 and it angers me that life has got worse not better for young girls and women.",,
Girls would frequently grab mine and other boys bums and comment on them with no backlash as if it was normal and funny,,
I once could not get into my bedroom in halls so a friend (ish) said I could come sleepover with him. He was very persistent and we slept together. People love him so much and he'd slept with so many girls people didn't believe he raped me and just thought I was saying that to avoid being another girl he had slept with,,
"I was raped [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], at the time I didn’t even know it was rape because I was wasted on alcohol (he was sober) but I always wondered because before hand I told him nothing more than making out but when came the time I said “sure”. I didn’t know it was rape until we did a lesson in school that people cannot consent to sex if under the influence",,
"I can’t remember what age I was bit I was in primary school around year 1-3. The boys in my year were joking around and played this game where they would take one of the girls and show their privates to the girls when they didn’t want to see them behind the bike shed at school. This happened to me, I was walking with my friends around the field and one of the boys in my year chose me, I was confused what was happening and he pushed me behind the bike shed and showed me his private’s and kissed me. I was frozen and scared and confused as I was only in year 2. The teachers did nothing. This game lasted for about 2 weeks.",,
I was walking home from school and there were these three boys. They were probably in the year below me but they stopped and let me overtake them. I'm a pretty fast walker so I thanked them. I then heard them making comments about my legs and my bottom. It made me super uncomfortable.,,
"It started when I was nine-twelve, there was this man who would “compliment” me. He would used words like “sexy” and “hot” referring to my body and clothes. He told me that my body is “mature” for my age that’s why he would say such things. It made me uncomfortable. Not to mention he would touch my leg or knee sometimes as a “joke”. I told one of my family members about this, they said he was just joking all of that. Now, I am truly uncomfortable of wearing such clothes like a tank top, or just a shirt that exposes my shoulders, I am uncomfortable of wearing short shorts now or skirts. The only reason why I am so reactive about this is because I was literally a child. I don’t think it is right to call a child who is wearing a short shorts “sexy” especially if you are an adult man. It’s literally pedophilia, unfortunately the legal age of sexual consent in the Philippines is 12. Please do help me share my story, I want to help change the legal age of sexual consent in my country. I don’t want any innocent young girls to feel uncomfortable with the clothes they are wearing. But please do not worry about me, I have no contact over that man anymore. My intention is to help change the sexual age consent in my country.",,
"One of my classmates touched me inappropriately, I was about 50 yards away from my teacher, he saw it and chose to do nothing.",,
I was at a party and got quite drunk and blacked out. When I woke up he was trying to force himself inside me. I managed to run out and call for my friends but he grabbed hold of my leg and pulled me down some stairs. My friends saved me but I still have the marks from where I fell.,,
he was my boyfriend at the time and he sexually assaulted me in my own home and when i came out about it he told everyone i was lying and not to believe me. i was bleeding and it hurt to pee after it he did it multiple times and i couldn’t fight him off,,
"I was at a mates flat party in our student halls at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], we were all very drunk, me especially, probably a drink away from being blackout. It was really late in the night and I remember a girl was saying she’d take care of me in my drunken state while being overly flirty and sexual. As things started to wrap up she said she’d walk me back to flat and on the walk home she was helping me to stand but also kept leaning in for a kiss which I kept swerving away from. When we get to my flat I thought that was it but she just followed me into my room and at that point I was ready to pass out so I just got into my pants and into bed to fall asleep and forget about the night, she however undressed also and began to suck me off to get me hard. She eventually did and began to ride on top of me as I was drifting in and out of consciousness from there I forget the rest but just remember waking up and seeing blood on my bed and she left her number on my desk and her thong was still on the floor. I didn’t leave my room for about two days, I didn’t eat or sleep because the anxiety attacks were so intense, I could barely get up to go to the toilet. I remember her smell on my pillows but I was in such a manic state that I couldn’t even change my bedding. 3 months on I’m not letting it define me and feel stronger every day",,
I was assaulted by my best friends brother at a sleepover. she blamed me and convinced me not to tell anyone. the boy never spoke to me again and i am left traumatised for life.,,
"I have so many accounts of incidents that occurred over decades. Here a good one, It was a summers day and I was wearing white Jeans and top. I walking down the road and a young man on his bike was riding pass. As he was doing so he slapped me really, really hard acrossed my bottom. While continued to ride by, he turn back his head and smirked and then started to laugh. I was frozen in shock then I tried to quickly throw my wedge shoe at the young man but he was long gone. I did reported it to the police but to no avail. I have many, many more stories like this. This is how us woman get treated on a daily basis in the UK.",,
"The worst thing about [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is not the vile rape culture or the amount of times rape and sexual assault have been swept under the rug within social groups. Instead it’s the failure of the school to do anything when people finally feel brave enough to speak out. By doing nothing and instead questioning the integrity of victims, they continue to reinforce this despicable behaviour. I was appalled and couldn’t stand it any longer.",,
"ages 9-12 were the worst years of my life. throughout that period i'd been groomed, raped and blackmailed into touching and being touched by someone i'd considered a close friend. quite a few more people than i'd like know about these events, rumours started about me being a whore and that i was freaky. the boys in my class always joke about raping each other and the girls in my class, which triggers me a lot but i can't say anything about it because then i'm a ""snowflake"" and ""can't handle dark humour"" i'd say my humour is quite dark, but there's a different between comedy and being a d*ck. also in english i sit next to one of the boys who make those types of jokes the most, he told everyone we're dating when we're not and squeezed my inner thigh under the table. when i told my friends they just said ""well that's *name* for you"". i don't think they understand how much it triggered me. the teachers hear the rape jokes, there's no way they don't, yet they just sit and type at their desks as if it's nothing. the same boy who touched me found out that i was raped at 9 and told me that he did it and would do it again (it he wasn't actually him, to clarify).",,
"When I was 13, I started flirting with a guy who was 15. We were staying late at school for rehearsals and ending up kissing. He put his hand down my skirt and I froze because I didn't know what was going on. I didn't say no because I was just completely in shock at being touched intimately. I didnt talk to anyone about it for a year, and when I eventually told people, suddenly the whole school knew. He denied it, and I was 'easy'. I never took it to staff because I thought it was my fault for leading him on. Even my closest friends taunted me with his name for years. I laughed it off because what else could I do? This event was a catalyst to a lot of my trauma which, 13 years later, I am finally dealing with in therapy. It stays with you.",,
"Massive drinking culture, sexually assaulted many different times between the ages of 14-16 and then slut shamed after……",,
"When i was 16 i had to stay at my friends house because i was too drunk to go home, we ended up kissing and i told him i wanted to stay a virgin. he got mad and asked why i would even go to his house, he then continued to rape me. when i told some of my friends i had to listen to half of them argue about if it was rape or not.",,
I was raped repeatedly at age 15 by a student.,,
"I was friends with this guy for a while after a while we started distancing because he was making racist, sexist and homophobic comments. A few months later he was making homophobic comments towards my friend so I messaged him and told him to stop making all the racist and homophobic comments. That’s when he started talking in a group chat with his friends about me saying he was going to rape but it wasn’t a one off thing he went up to one of my friends and said he had a group chat about how they want to have sex with her. The school know about this and still chose to do nothing. I showed them proof and still nothing happened . He laughs about how he didn’t get punished.",,
I was in year 8 and I met up with this boy who was in year 11 in Hyde park. He kept trying to finger me and I told him that I don’t want to (I literally had never even kissed anyone before) but he repeatedly kept asking - so I finally gave in. It hurt so bad but I felt like I couldn’t say stop because I was so young . He made me give him head aswell - I was 13 and he was 16. Too fucked up.,,
"Me and my partner decided to make love, and it was 100% consensual but after the first time he demanded that we should do it even when I didn’t want to. A few times I said stop but he didn’t stop. We always used protection but this one time he had taken off the condom half way through without me knowing",,
"It was the "" touch a girls butt week "" and I was slapped on my butt twice trying to help another girl from getting her's slapped, and when I when to tell all the staff did was say that they where going to talk to him but, it didn't stop. He tried multiple times for the rest of the week and I would try my best to avoid him but I had a class with him, he did stop but I felt disgusting.",,
I was held down in the school bathroom,,
"When I was 14, I had a boyfriend and I went to his house. We were watching a movie and I consented to kissing him, he then unbuttoned my jeans and I told him no. He then continued by telling me I was being boring and pushed me down with his arm pushing on my stomach. I gave in as I physically couldn’t move and in my head I thought he wouldn’t like me anymore if I didn't. At the time, I didn't think anything of what happened, but now as a 16 year old girl i’ve realised that my body reacts to my current boyfriend putting his hand where that boy pushed me down. I told my boyfriend today what that boy did and he’s the first person I’ve ever told.",,
I had this neighbor he was very old and i was about 9-11 yrs old (can’t remember) everyday i would go over there because i considered him a friend because i was young and i loved having friends but anytime i would ask for a snack he would make me sit on his lap and give him a “kiss” but it wasn’t just a peck he made it more than that with his hand sitting on my upper thigh,,
fingered in the schools bathroom unconsensually.,,
"Reading all these posts from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] has brought back so many memories of the horrible culture at the school. Three things sprung to mind:,1. An IT teacher who would massage our shoulders and feel our bras straps, and come round behind us and put his hand over ours on the mouse. The girls used to put jumpers on before his lessons so he couldn’t look down our tops - it was rumoured he was fired from an all girls school for having an affair with a 6th former,2. The first girl in the year to have sex was applauded and heckled by the entire lunch hall until she ran out - I found her crying in the bathroom (she was in year 9 and the launch hall was year 9-11 maybe 200 people?),3. The whole of year 8 sharing a video of a girl in year 7 she sent to her bf of her dancing in her bra - the teachers found out and did nothing - she was bullied the for the whole way through the school.",,
"I grew up around these boys,we were in a big friendship group together.Life seemed great.Until,they started getting more violent and cruel.They left our group because of a small argument.They would touch me inapprotatly and twerk on me 'as a joke'.They told me 'don't be so sensitive'.When I confronted them about touching me they said it was an accident.The touching happened multiple times.",,
"When I was in school this boy sexually assaulted me, forced me to do things and filmed it. He black mailed me with my own pictures. He asked multiple people to try and get nudes from me when I refused to send them. 4 years later the harassment continued, he made a fake dating account of me and linked it to my Snapchat so that people would ask me for pictures. He finally made another fake Snapchat account pretending to be someone else and begged me for pictures (I knew it was him because Snapchat maps showed the location was his house) I used to be in a group chat with 15 other girls and I know he’s down similar things to them including revenge porn, blackmail and the worse rape. If 15 girls were harmed from him only in secondary school I’m scared to think what it has been in uni/adulthood.",,
"At the age of 18 I was blackmailed and manipulated by a large group of girls in my year into having sex frequently with a different girl each time. I was degraded, humiliated and penetrated. They would make me do anything they could think of, one of them even wrote a blog with a feminist spin on it about how what they were doing was for the good of womankind. I had planned on being sparing and careful with my sex life, only sleeping with someone when it felt right to me but I had that taken from me. I cannot look at myself in the mirror anymore, I cannot ever think about myself as an entity or I start to have suicidal thoughts. This wasnt helped by the way people responded when I tried to reach out. I told two girls who I trusted at the time and one male friend. One girl called me a liar, the other briefly and dismissively acknowledged what had happened but kept talking about how its not as bad as when things like this happen to women as its less likely to occur. I botched telling the lad cause I talked about the sex before prefacing it by telling him I had suffered a lot of trauma, he started congratulating me and I didnt bother finishing my story. Let me just say I have nothing against feminism as its a great thing, in fact it is because it is a great thing that makes this whole situation worse as some of the people abusing me did what they did in the name of it. I fear that many feminists as righteous as they may be in their cause arent ready to call out the negativity in their own movement and in my personal case I feel more and more hesitant to call myself one as much as I align with feminist ideals. It is a tainted word for me after what was done to me and how little other feminists I reached out to were ready to accept what had happened to me as a man. I live in a constant state of helplessness, unable to face or respect myself, unable to tell anyone for fear of being misunderstood. This is the first time I have opened up since telling my friends, it has now been two years and it takes a lot of will and self medication to keep myself alive. I know some who read this wont believe it and that hurts to think about but I hope that my story can be heard and acknowledged and that the social/political climate has changed enough among regular people that someone is ready to hear it.",,
"He was 18 and I was 15 he had a gun, and brought me to his house and that’s when things happened. I was not okay with anything he had suggested, but I was manipulated into the situation. I was a virgin and he took something I cant get back. After everything my sister picked me up I was taken to the hospital and was tested on, and had to talk to many people. All I wanted was to go home but I was forced to talk to cops. Talking to the cops was so useless, they helped in no way. He’s out doing whatever he wants in the world, because cops trusted him over me. I still can’t cope with understanding that this was not my fault, but the guilt is just making it harder to believe.",,
I was sexually assaulted when I was a freshman by a member of a fraternity. The school stopped providing mental health resources to me after one year and referred me to seek outpatient care.,,
"I was curvy for my age of 13 so I got a lot of unwanted attention. I was told the only way to stop this was by wearing baggy cloths. This stopped some of the harassment but there was one of my friends who started putting pressure on me to do stuff. I was in a bad place because of other things going on and he was threatening me. So I did what he wanted but then he just used that to blackmail me for more stuff he wanted. I later found out he was doing the same to one of his other friends, he got reported but nothing ever happened.",,
"sexual assault, trauma. ive had my bum grabbed, brushed against, touched multiple times by men. many many men, students more than teachers, have made me feel extremely uncomfortable with either their words, hands, legs, and even privates. i once had my wrist grabbed and my arm checked all over repeatedly for self harm scars by a person i rarely spoke to.",,
"I was raped when I was eighteen. My one drink had been spiked at a nightclub called Public. We were celebrating an [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys birthday. His friend, who I had also known for a while, said he’d take me to my house by taxi but instead took me to his where he raped me. For years I blamed myself, struggled with depression, took numerous drugs and eventually tried to kill myself. When I finally told my male friends who I had been friends with for 10 years at this point and had thought myself incredibly close to, they told me it must be a “misunderstanding”.",,
I was on the bus In middle school after after school and a kid I thought of as a friend touched my butt and grabbed my boob I tried to slap him. I reported him but they did not do anything because they did not see anything on the cameras.,,
"despite going to guidance after being touched inappropriately by a boy in school they acted like a made a deal out of it and didn’t do anything about it, they even told the kid and now he makes a deal of constantly picking on me, yet teachers don’t care because ‘he acts like that all the time’ it sucks for us girls that our voices are never heard",,
"Between the ages of 4 to 10 I was molested by a family friend. I still have to see him sometimes, have to sit across from him at dinner parties and answer his small talk questions about my life. My sister recently confided in me and turns out he was doing the same thing to her too. We don’t want to tell our parents because my mum was sexually abused by her dad as a child and it would break her to know we’ve been through it too.",,
In my primary school from years 4 (i was 8-9) i was sexualy abused by the boys regularly they would ask ti sit with me and put their hands uo my skirt and couldn't do anything because they knew where i lived and i was scared of them as they had older friends ine if them was my ex and he would regularly try and put his hands in my pants and try to convince me to have sex with him knowing i was uncomfortable they would slap and squeez my but in lines and in class and no one ever noticed or cared and its given me so much trauma that new when u go to a new school or meet new boys that im so overly dominant to the point if them being scared of me so i know they wont try anything,,
"A boy who was at the time one of my closest male friends used his ex girlfriends Snapchat details to text me, pretending to be her, trying to get me to send him nudes. I wasn’t the only one.",,
"When I was 9 another girl I new who was 10/11 (that was a family friend) asked me to take my clothes off and she did lots of uncomfortable things. But I was 9 and I didnt remember it clearly but its coming back. Does this still count because people could argue that she was around my age, didn't know what she was doing, and a female as well as me. But itesses with my mental health and opinions on my body image.",,
"This girl I knew used to get very touchy with me and my friends, always brushing over our chests and once even clinging to another girls leg. She would stare a lot in the locker room and started rumours about me, saying she and I did sexual things together. I never did, but these rumours got widespread and made me feel gross. I was shamed for this and I’d only just come out as bi so it made me feel awful. I don’t want to say what school I came from because everyone would know. All I want to say is girls can be the ones doing these gross things as well.",,
"I had to be informed by a friend that I was almost raped when I was black out drunk, I don’t remember a thing",,
"I was at school and during class this guys tries to rub his leg against me and i was just disgusted,it was horrifying and he said thats just how it is.",,
"I was 15, he was 18. We’d been drinking (in a large group). Pinned me down so I couldn’t move. I was screaming no but he didn’t stop. Until my friend’s mum found me and pulled him off me.",,
"I have been toying with the idea about whether or not to write about this for some time, constantly burdened by overwhelming guilt that what these boys did to me, they might do to other girls. Although I’m still not strong or brave enough to go into details, out of fear of being recognised, I have been sexually assaulted by multiple [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] boys. One of my worst experience was with a boy on multiple occasions physically abusing me to the point where I’d be hit, nearly pass out, and have countless marks left on my body. The moment that haunts me the most and replays in my head is when I said no to giving him head 10 times in a row, I kept saying it and saying it and he wouldn’t take no for an answer, he then proceeded to forcefully make me do it while I was choking and crying. He got pleasure out of this. I havnt felt the same since. I feel violated, betrayed and so angry, yet I feel so weak and silenced.",,
"Im not sure if this is as bad as others but I still want to share it as it kind of scared me. I’m in year 7 and once I was in form , sitting down ( my skirt bunches up when I sit around my stomach ) so I rolled it up a bit just around mid thigh area and my male form tutor came and looked under my desk when I did it. I’m officially scared of men.",,
"When I was 15, my friend and I were invited to a popular juniors house. He was there with his friend. I should have known to not go over there, looking back what else would he want with a freshman. I was trying to fit in and make them think I was cool, so I drank and smoke like them. I got way too drunk and couldn’t even control my body. I kept saying no, but he didn’t ever stop. I never said anything about it to anyone and tried to forget about it. I kept blaming myself. A year later, he did it to another freshman. Except this time, he drugged her. She went to the police and another victim came forward, but stayed anonymous. Because he was so popular, she got bullied relentlessly by students and even some staff. She spent 4 months outside of school because the bullying was so bad and he was still allowed to walk the same halls as her. He finally got sentenced to jail. But, I will never forgot how everyone treated her when she came forward. It was sickening.",,
"I worked in a pub that had staff accommodation. I didn’t live in but would sometimes crash on the sofa when the team and I had a few drinks after work. One night, one of the guys that lived in stayed up after everyone else had gone to bed, I wanted to sleep but he wouldn’t leave. He then proceeded to climb on top of me, pinning me down on the sofa and putting his hand up my shirt. I tried to fight him off but wasn’t strong enough. I told him if he didn’t get off of me, I would scream and wake the others up. He then got off of me, went over to the other sofa and stayed there watching me the rest of the night. I was too drunk to drive home so stayed awake the whole night. When I reported it the next day to my male manager, I was told he probably didn’t mean it and to let it go. Don’t be so sensitive, nothing happened.",,
A teacher said to some girls that he had an experience of a false accusation against him and that if we report something we need to be completely sure as things can be exaggerated. There was more said but this essentially felt like discouraging girls to speak up and even though its small it adds to the anti speak up culture at this school.,,
"Me and my sister always got the bus back from school a few years back and almost every single day when we got off at our stop, this guy, who was apparently my sisters friend, would shout at her: “Marry me, I only want my dick sucking.” I remember at the time I laughed at it, I thought it was a compliment and I remember thinking what it would be like for someone to shout something like that at me, because it would mean that I was desirable. I only now realised how messed up it was that it happened, and that I wanted it to happen to me too. More recently, some classmates comment on how ‘fit’ I look and how they want to have sex with me. I try my best to ignore them, and I want to protest but I feel disgusting even being near them. I know they don’t actually find me desirable or attractive, they just want to assert a feeling of power over me, they want to feel in control. I feel awful, especially since my sister has had to endure much worse objectification than me, and that this disgusting language is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to rape culture.",,
"In year 9 a boy I was friends with asked me out. When I said no he then tried to pressure me by saying he was going to kill himself. When I continued to say no, he then created a rape fantasy about me that he told his friends on Xbox. It later got shared around the school and people would tease me about it, that he was going to take me and tie me down. I had to sit next to him for 2 years after.",,
"Snapchat is one of my main socials that I spend most of my time on and I enjoy it from time to time apart from when I would get begged and repeatedly asked to send nudes or inappropriate photos of myself after saying no, after refusing to do so i suddenly get called names like a slag ect or “frigid” just for not sending photos. I also find I would get removed by them or maybe even ignored for not wanting to send and I know many people who have gone through this too. Then the person who have asked would then ask again and again another day and continue to do so until I remove them and if you refuse they make you feel bad about it",,
"Over a year ago I had been talking to this guy for a while, and we were really close even though I knew he was just using me to get over his ex - he admitted it later on. One night we were out and I had a panic attack. He took me home and stayed with me, I trusted him. However, we were lying together whilst I was still coming down from the panic attack, I was pretty out of it and didn't really know what was going on. He must of thought that suddenly touching me sexually was going to help but obviously it really didn't. I actually didn't think much of it at the time, as like I said I was really out of it. But when I look back on it, I realise it was actually a really fucked up situation and I still don't know how to deal with it.",,
"This happened just yesterday, I was walking in my skirt and a man drove past me. The man stuck his entire head out of the window to stare at my ass and whislted. I stuck my middle finger up at him and the driver honked his horn and started reversing so the other man could get a second look. I'm 17.",,
"You don’t know what your friends are really like. My friend raped me. None of his friends know, and they all follow this account and post about how important consent is. The one friend that I told simply said that he would ‘never do that on purpose’. I worry that he could rape one of them. Another friendship of mine ended because he assaulted my friend. I would never have thought these things of them in a million years, but here we are. Believe victims, talk to your friends about consent.",,

"i was telling a male counsellor what i had been through and he said to me ""is this what you imagined then"" i said no it happened then he said ""sounds like you imagined it"" !!! he was not nice, and he then got a bit nasty at me telling me i was weird for remembering so much of what happened to me like little details! This was narcissistic of him, i don't trust anyone anymore. as this man was supposed to be helping me through trauma!! no wonder a lot of us keep things to ourselves. I am thankful for this platform at least.",,
"Someone I thought was a mate touched me up in my sleep. He wanted to hang after a night out and even though I hadn't slept much the night before and had gone to uni but I thought it was all very innocent as he knew the guy I was on and off seeing long term (which I am 100% he knew). He showed up hours later than agreeded and then mentioned that he couldn't go back to the house he was staying at becuse they had an early lecture. I said it was fine and set up a bed on our very large sofa. I explained to him I hadn't slept much and would most likely pass out while watching the film on my bed. I was in my bed and he wasn't at the time. I feel asleep and woke up to him fully in my bed. Thinking it was innocent I moved up to give him and myself space and tryed to go back to sleep. I then thought I was in bed with the man I was seeing but then realised and woke up to him fully up against my body feeling up my legs and ass, having been abused as a Child by my best friends dad this petrified me for good reason. I kept trying to move my arm and then he'd stop, then go back again and again. I was having a full blown pannic attack at this point but still very still; feeling trapped in my own bed with this guy. Eventually he tried to touch my boob which was an awkward place to get to and suddenly my body shot up. I shouted at him to move and he did nothing still pretending to be alseep. I put two pillows between us but I couldn't get back to sleep. I lived next to the uni so I went there as it was empty that early in the morning and cried. ,I went back before my lecture to get ready for uni and he was awake and asked where I was. I decided to try and confront him but saying """"you know why I left"""" he seemed confused but acknowleged somthing had gone on he said """"oh I think I know what might have happened""""... I asked """"what do you mean"""" and he told me that he slept in a bed with his lesbian friend and that """"she said he touched her up in her sleep"""" and insisted that he did these things in his sleep and that maybe the same thing happened to me. ,I was shocked and angry at this point. Running on pure adrenaline. I said to him """"if you knew you had a history of doing these things in your sleep then why would you endanger me by sleeping in my bed when I had set up a bed for him in the other room?"""" After this it was clear there was no way of holding him accountable. He asked I not tell anyone and I said I wouldn't tell his friends but I would tell anyone else as I feel violated but I really regret saying that as that gave him all my power. ,I initially just told the man I was seeing who told me it was my fault and that I got myself into this situation which I think was said because he was angry with the situation but that act really solidified my mistrust in telling anyone or getting some accountability from the man who touched me up.,I did eventually tell my best mate who was a mutual friend. She was appalled and disgusted but no surprised as this guy was know for me if a bit touchy with the girls on night out. She then later went to his male best mate who was a close friend of his and told him what he had done- his friend completely dismissed it as a accident or that I had gotten the wrong end of the stick. ,In the end I’ve had to be in the Same room and go out on night clubs and festivals after with the same man who caused me so much distress knowing that he violated my body and knowing others knew and openly blamed me. I have a great sense of shame about it mainly for not telling them all and standing up for myself. I now choose not to go to anything that involved that friend group and am living my best life without them!",,
"The first boy I had sex with posted on yikyak back when everyone was using it: ‘I popped [my first and last name]’s cherry in the back of my car’ like my virginity was a trophy to be won. Yikyak was anonymous so it was just a method of shaming me. I was so humiliated that when people asked me if it was true I lied and said no. I had just turned 15 (he was almost 18) and I felt branded for the rest of my time at school. He and his friends thought it was hilarious, I would see them laugh among themselves if I ever had to walk by them.",,
"I had a one night stand with a guy during my first year at uni. He seemed nice, was a friend of a friend so I figured I could trust him. It was all consensual, however during sex he kept asking if he could remove the condom, and I kept telling him no. Afterwards I could tell that something wasn’t right. He kept making comments about how we were such “couple goals” and talking about making our relationship official - it really freaked me out so I asked him to leave and he did, but not without taking my accommodation keycard and key for my flat door without my knowledge so he could have an excuse see me again. After he left I went back i realised that he had taken the condom off despite me explicitly telling him not too several times. The next day I felt dirty, like something awful had happened however I didn’t even understand the extent of what he actually did to me that night. I didn’t even know the name of it - stealthing - until a year later when I saw people online talking about a case of it where a man was charged with rape after he’d taken the condom off without the woman’s knowledge during sex. Knowing what actually happened to me was a thing was somewhat a comfort but also horrific as it made it all real.",,
It was a few days before my 16th birthday. Our school organised an end of year party. I'm disabled. My friends got me drunk. One of the boys raped me behind the building. The next day I told the school nurse. She gave me the morning after pill and I spent my 16th birthday vomiting all day.,,
"At my own birthday party, my girlfriend at the time took me up to my room and tried to get me to do things to her. I wanted to be downstairs enjoying my birthday but she wanted me to do things because “she was horny” and “I usually do it”. I didn’t think anything of it at the time because I was drunk but looking back I realised the way I was treated wasn’t okay.",,
"In year 10, just before my 15th birthday, I was forcibly fingered against my will by a boy in a music practice room. After the incident, he would repeatedly tell me via instagram and in person how “good” i tasted on his fingers after he forced himself on me. I never consented to him doing it to me nor was I able too due to how mentally ill i was at the time.",,
"I was always touched, Boobs, Ass, Everything by this one other girl, I kept telling her to stop, but she continued. Threatening me. I wont go into detail as im still recovering from it. But nothing happened after the school found out. The police told them to make sure me and that girl were never in the same classes or groups. But they made it so i sat next to her in everything.",,
A group of boys stood up in a Sixth Form lesson with signs telling me to “get my tits out”,,
"When I was in my freshman year of high school, a boy sexualy asulted me. He slid his hands under my shirt and grabbed my chest. The school and police did nothing about it. Im forced to suffer with my ptsd everyday because we are still in school and they keep putting him in my classes. No one at school believes me. My principal blamed it on what i was wearing. I was wearing a sweater and jeans.",,
"At school it was like boys felt entitled to our bodies. There were almost daily comments. I'm fortunate that the physical stuff was rarer for me. But it happened. I was just walking to class one day and a boy (who had previously attacked me during primary school) lifted his shirt and pressed his bare chest against my back. He was laughing. His friends were laughing. All the boys were in on it. They came up with a ""smacking arses"" day, where anyone could slap anyone's arse and it was supposedly fine because that was the theme of the day. But then it wasn't restricted to one day. For months after boys would just smack you and you felt like you couldn't say anything because that was the game. The only boy in my friend group was the most frequent offender for me. One day he escalated. He came up behind me and put his hand between my legs. It was only when he felt the crinkle of the pad I was wearing that he removed his hand. He even had the audacity to say, ""What the f*ck was that!?"" as if I had somehow wronged him. I felt lucky to be on my period that day. I have no idea what he'd have done if my pad hadn't scared him off. The staff were useless. No one told us this was wrong.",,
"During my time at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I was sexually assaulted by another student. They were much stronger and bigger than me as well as what was called a ""Teachers pet"" so i felt like i couldn't tell anyone at all. They had gone on to do this to multiple people, to where people they'd do it in front of other students who started to laugh it off and say it was just them being funny and charming. It wasn't. The fear I felt during the times they did assault me was immeasurable and for it to be laughed off as a joke was awful. I still have nightmares of it.",,

I was in year 7 and a boy i thought i was friends with grabbed me by the wrist and “demanded” i give him oral sex in an empty classroom. i said no multiple times but he was so persistent i felt like i had to give in,,
"While walking home from school, about 10 metres from the school gates two boys started shouting at me about how my arse and how it looked.",,
"When I was just 18, (I’m almost 20 now) I went to a summer party at my best friends house. The party was in a marquee and was mostly with people I didn’t know, so I was quite nervous, however my best friends younger brother and his friends were there too. When everybody started arriving, we played some drinking games and i immediately got quite drunk, although I felt safe, as it was at my friend’s house, and some of her family were there too. As the night progressed, me and my friend got more and more intoxicated, in fact, by the end of the night I was so drunk that I was falling over and passing out. I could barely talk or even think straight. Throughout the night there was one slightly awkward boy who kept trying to get with me, and actually got quite rude when I ended up getting with someone else. Me and my friend had such a good time, even though we were very drunk, and the people that didn’t have a ride home (we were in the countryside) all piled (or passed out in my case) on some big bean bags with blankets on them in the corner of the marquee. I was completely asleep under my own blanket, with people around me, when I felt someone slide their hand up my vagina. My mind was still swimming from the alcohol, I had no idea what was happening, I completely froze. He then carried on fingering and rubbing my vagina, and the rest of my body underneath my dress. I turned my head and he kissed me on my closed mouth, with my teeth closed. He continued to do this. He then took my hand and put it on his penis, I still didn’t respond. After a few seconds of touching him I said “we shouldn’t be doing this” (I don’t know why I didn’t say fuck off but I didn’t exactly have the energy, I was so scared). He ignored me and continued. I turned away multiple times, and I remember him trying to convince me. Eventually, after I don’t know how long, he stopped, I think I said “Stop” but I can’t be sure. The person who did this was my best friend’s brother’s best friend. I had known him vaguely from school and had even been friends with his sister. I hadn’t even spoken to him the whole evening. He watched me get into a situation where I couldn’t save myself, and then he assaulted me. The next day, the boy who had been trying to speak to me the night before called me a slut, later I found out he saw him walking towards me when I was passed out and did nothing.",,
When I was 16 following a night out I needed up in a bathroom of a friends house making out with the boy I liked. He offered to go down on me which I consented to but the lights were out in the bathroom and before long I realised he had swapped to penetration without asking. I had never had sex before and maybe he thought I wouldn’t have noticed but it hurt so much. I didn’t feel like I could say anything because I only realised whilst it was happening. It’s not how I wanted my first time to be and I felt so worthless that the person I liked had just taken what they wanted without permission. I spent years trying to rationalise this experience tell myself I wanted to have sex with him so that it would be okay but it’s affects so much. That moment of realisation that I was being betrayed in some way recurs in my mind.,,
"i know this isn’t anywhere near as severe as some of the testimonies made but i feel like this is so normalised and should be spoken about. there was a boy at my school who, from year 7-11, would make inappropriate comments on girls bodies, commenting on their ass and boobs, rating girls and outright asking girls if they wanted to have sex with him. me and many other girls felt so uncomfortable around him, he’d touch me whenever i had to sit next to him in class and what’s worse all the students and teachers knew about this but he would always get away with it because ‘it’s just a joke’ or ‘that’s just how he is’ many of the other boys would encourage him and just laugh at his comments and he got away with so many things that he shouldn’t have.",,
"I was 16, having just done my GCSEs, when I lost my virginity to this guy was who in the year above me. We met at a festival. At first everything was consensual. However, the guy clocked on quite quickly that he could take advantage of me and my friends. I was in the midst of the trauma associated with two of my best friends being suicidal and witnessing one suicide attempt- therefore I was looking for escapism. One of said friends kept insisting on coming to the guy's house with me, who was very vulnerable with incredibly serious mental health issues. We ended up having a threesome which neither of us girls could consent to as we were high. Then, the guy began being rougher with me and choking me. I asked him to stop, saying that I didn't like it, which he ignored. Because I was unaware of the intricacies of consent, I was unaware that these acts constituted rape because I had not consented. I continued hanging around with the guy until the end of summer. I had moved schools for sixth form, and the last I heard of the guy was that he had raped said friend once I'd stopped sleeping with him. The cherry on the cake was that the guy's ex girlfriend new some girls in the year above my friend and I at school. She had left him for similar reasons. Yet instead of reaching out to warn us about him, she asked her friends to bully us on her behalf for associating with him. Took me three years to realise that I had been raped and to recognise how it had shaped my following sexual experiences.",,
"I was 17 and at a party with all my friends. My ex boyfriend was there and at the end of the night he told me he had gotten a room with a bed for us to sleep in. When we lay in bed together he made sexual advances on me and I told him to stop. He huffed and turned away visibly angry. He told me that it was normal for exes to sleep together and that I was being stupid. I hesitantly agreed, but when we started having sex I began sobbing audibly and using my hand to move him away. He looked at me and carried on until he’d finished. I cried for the rest of the night whilst he slept, and we never spoke about it again.",,
a guy who was 5 years older than me (10 and 15) coerced me into touching him. he also touched me without consent (around all my friends btw) then he stalked me for the next 4 years (made several accounts on social media just to “see what i was up to” as he said. he talked about coming up to my window and kidnapping me and then r@ping me. i still have not told my parents and i don’t think i ever can.,,
"When I was 9 years old I went to stay at my grandmothers flat. While we were staying I had a family friend (my older sister was there as well) who was staying as well.,He was about 50-55. He was very close with my grandmother as his mother was my grandmothers best friend.,Later into the night, I remember my sister and I sleeping in a bed with my grandma (as we always did) and my grandma suggesting he come lie with us.,He lay next to me. I remember his hand touching me constantly, my chest, my private parts, my thigh. I didn’t say anything and when my sister got up to leave I went with her and we told our uncle we were uncomfortable so we slept in his bed.,However as I got older, I didn’t hear much at all of these stores and for a long time let it be. I’d see him at family parties and I’d tense up but I never admitted to it. It wasn’t until year 8 I stated talking about it and my friends explained how wrong it was of him to have done that. When I told my family, I experienced a lot of “are you sure”, “how do you know?” “He might have meant it in a different way.” To the point where I know wonder if it did happened.,I’m a teenager now and it’s hard because a part of me feels he did, but the other part is still confused after it all.",,
My teacher was a pedo and kept looking at my bum,,
"This didn’t happen to me, by I rember when I was in year seven I crossed the street and heard a group of hear eleven boys ~yelling~ “you’re only with her because she gives you a cookie every time she fucks you”. I remember being appalled by how they reduced her to nothing but a sex toy.",,
"Halloween second year, I was out at a club and completely smashed. I got separated from my friends and some guy dressed as Mario cornered me and pinned me down and fingered me. I was too weak to protest. The bouncers pulled him off me. I don't know what happened to him but I was so upset that I went straight home and cried.",,
"Through out school I always got cat called while I was walking to school, I was only 12",,
"I was at a friend’s house for a Spring party when I was 11. I went to a school nearby to theirs and they were friends of my brother as well, although they were around 12/13. I was the only girl in a group with around 6 boys. They saw me do what they classified as a “revealing” position on the trampoline, in fact i was doing a straddle in preparation for a trampolining competition. They saw it and they said things like “she’s literally asking for it” and “why’s she doing that? that’s just wrong”. They then proceeded to come over and ask if i wanted to play truth or dare, being young and not knowing that they wanted to do other kind of truths or dares, accepted. We played quite nicely for a while, but then the dares started getting worse, things like “i dare you to kiss everyone here”, “i dare you to give X a lap dance” and things like that, i didn’t really want to accept, but i still did as they were pressuring me and saying that i was “no fun”. They then, after that night, didn’t want anything to do with me at all, and haven’t made any attempt to contact me or ask if i’m okay or anything. I still see a few of them, as they are my brother’s friends, but i have chosen to remain silent. This is one of the reasons why people need to be educated from a young age.",,
"Raped by a former boyfriend who also emotionally abused me. Was so shocked after it happened I fled his house in the middle of the night. After I confronted him about what he did, he denied any wrongdoing. We broke up and then he proceeded to stalk me, standing outside my house in the middle of the night, keeping tabs on me. The worst part, this happened in the 1st year of uni and we were on the same course, so I literally had to look at him every day for 3 years after. He also lived with some friends of mine in a student house but I could never go round to see them, and they didn’t know why as I was too ashamed to tell them.",,
"When I was 16 I was at this guys house. I had gotten together with him before but I was unsure about him. I was a bit drunk and he lead me up the stairs and took me to his room and we started making out. It was all consensual but I felt quite uncomfortable. He then asked to have sex with me and I said no because I didn’t want to. He said fine but then over the course of the next 20 minutes he asked me 8 more times and every time I said no. He then said to me if I wasn’t going to have sex with him I might as well go home. I felt guilty for not sleeping with him and went home and at the time I never knew that what had happened was bad, I just thought it was completely normal behaviour. Only now do I realise how not ok it was.",,
"I shared a taxi home the other week with a boy I’ve known since I was 9 years old. We had kissed in the past but it didn’t work out and now we were friends. About two minutes into the taxi ride, he tried to kiss me. I said no and said I’d rather be friends. Literally two second later he tried again. And I said what are you doing, I said no. Then, whilst stuck in a cab with him, he fricking tries a third time, this time putting his hands around my neck and saying “but I’m paying for the cab ride”. Luckily I got out a few minutes later but it’s horrifying to think what might’ve happened if I’d been trapped in that car for longer..",,
My school didn’t deal with anything that the younger years said to us. I was in year 13 (the sixth form is mixed the gcse years are single sex -boys) they grouped me and touched me while I was walking in the corridor and the school did nothing I even tried to get police involved but no one did anything because everyone kept saying boy will be boys— this quote should stop being used. Boy can be boys that treat women with the respect they deserve!!!,,
"My ex-boyfriend would hurt me during sex. He wouldn't do it intentionally, or so he said, but he also didn't intentionally stop it after the multiple times I told him to. I would show him the bruises and he would cry and I would comfort him for hurting me. This happened a lot, me comforting him for what he had done wrong. In trying to help him I constantly invalidated my own sense of being and of what he was doing to me.",,
I am a guy and I was at a party and a group of girls came up behind me and one slapped my ass. For the next couple of years I have felt embarrassed and violated and too scared to tell my friends. I know I am a guy but it still goes both ways.,,
I had recently started seeing a boy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I really liked him but wanted to take my time before we had sex (I was a virgin). He was very respectful and never pressured me. I later found out that his friends at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] had told him he had to sleep with me before a certain date or break up with me. He waited until I was ready but his friends had decided i was ‘waiting too long’ and I was too frigid.,,
"I had a boyfriend from [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] to [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], at first everything was perfect he was this tall, pretty ripped basketball player with this lovely dirty blonde hair and icy blue eyes... he was also my age which helped... I fell for him pretty fast and he told me he loved me within the first 2 months of dating and everything felt great until we had the talk... he was ready to have sex and wanted me to be his first and I told him I wasn’t ready, the first time he was calm and brushed it off but over the next few weeks he started to ask the question in a more insistent manner, kept asking and asking until I told him “enough” and he got angry... he has this exercise equipment in his room and he was so angry that he took a pole from it and smacked me over the shoulder with it. That was the first time he hit me, then it became more frequent, more forceful, he’d throw chairs, and weights that were as heavy as 20kg (the weight of my 3 year old brother!), he’d choke me and beat me... then august came and he sexually assaulted me after spiking my drink at a small gathering, he then cheated on me with his ex and we broke up. He assaulted me a few times after that too... and he promised he loves me and would never hurt me."",The “popular” boys group at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] used to talk about girls who were their friends and classmates like we were pieces of meat. They’d play a game where they’d say a girl in our year and then all give their opinions on who was one rank above and one rank below based on appearance alone. They’d make their way through all the girls in the year and debate us like we were objects up for auction. And then expected us to be grateful if we made it into the top ten.""",,
"I was sexually assaulted when the person thought I was sleeping. Sticks with me, I can’t even sleep in the same bed with anyone anymore.",,
"I was 13 and I was assaulted by my bestfriends boyfriend, I'll call him [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. Oneday i was going to meet up with my boyfriend, I'll call him [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], at the time and [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] wasn't available to come out as we planned so I asked around and [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was. After 15 mins or so [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] was where me and [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] decided we'd meet and he wasn't alone he brought one of his old friends I barely knew, I'll call him [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], everything was like friends but I made sure we were in public places because eventhough I was 13 I knew something didn't feel right. It got to when I had to leave and my grandad called me asking how long I'd be until I got to his house as any adult would do. But at the same time [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] were cornering me and touching me in places that I I what them to. This didn't stop and the fear overwhelmed me and I realised if I didn't show them what the wanted, which was to see my boobs (yes at 13 gross I know), they wouldn't let me go. So i gave in. They saw, touched and videoed me whilst I was crying hoping that something would happen so I could run away. When they finished [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] turned to me and said ""you better not report this the last bitch that tried to get me don't for rape got nowhere"". I know I wasn't raped but I was sexually assaulted and the fear and guilt-of letting them see- still hasn't left me and I'm almost 16.",,
I was in maths class and I was doing my work the teacher had set and there was the boy who was one desk away from me and he started making it very clear to me and the other girls close to him that he had an erection and was forcing us to look at it. He then told one of the girls to sit on it which she said no to but he persisted. The teacher I belive was never informed.,,
"I’ve been harassed, coerced, assaulted and raped in my life. All the perpetrators have one thing in common: they went to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]",,
He was my bf at the time and we went in the elevator to drop my friend (who was in crutches at the time) off at her next class. After she got off we got back on the elevator I went to go press a button and he wouldn’t let me. He graded me and he started touching me and he would stop I said no so many times it hurt me knowing that he would do such a thing. Then he told everyone that I begged for it and I got named a slut.,,
Went into school to report a rape of a classmate by a classmate. Was called in later the next day to write down everything I knew about the situation. Proceeded to be told girls my age shouldn’t be getting drunk and need to carry rape alarms and always be on high alert to prevent rape. No mention of the fact that the rapist shouldn’t have raped. This was a female ‘Head of SafeGuarding’. Went back and requested consent programmes because they obviously didn’t get it. Finally having a consent talk after a year of complaining but it’s only for the year 13s.,,
"When I was in year 8 I remember standing in the queue to get snacks from the cantine and an older sixth form girl was standing behind me with her friend. I was very shy and I was not with any of my friends at the time. I remember hearing this girl tell her friend that I would never say anything is she decided to touch me, her friend laughed. The girl grabbed my bum and they both started laughing, I did not even turn around because I was so scared. I can remember exactly what she looked like but I have no idea who she was. I went home and told my mum and I felt so ashamed like I had done something wrong. I wanted to tell the school but was too frightened and I had no idea who the girl was so I never told the school.",,
"Despite framing itself as 'inspiring women' and 'educating the next generation of female leaders', my school frequently told off/banned girls from wearing too short/tight skirts or dresses, and tops that were too low-cut or showed bra straps. Even when we were wearing skorts or shorts for sports in lessons we had to wear leggings or tracksuits as bare legs were deemed too distracting for our male teachers.",,
"For a school that claimed to be so politically progressive and feminist, our clothes were unbelievably regulated. One female head of year in particular used the phrase “boobs, bums and bellies” and would yell this at passing students if she felt they weren’t covered enough. We were told in an assembly that revealing clothes were distracting to boys and MALE STAFF, despite attending an all-girls school with a mixed sixth form. Coupled with this the head of pastoral care had a reputation for being horrible to everyone and held an assembly once screaming and slut-shaming us so much that several girls left the assembly crying afterwards. The amount of girls that came out of that school with lasting mental health issues is shocking, especially given its outstanding academic achievement.",,
When i was 9 year old boy in the mid 1970's i used to like train spotting. I used to go by myself to a local railway depot. One day i was walking to the depot when a man in a Jaguar sports car pulled up alongside me and asked me if a required a lift anywhere. I got in his car. He didn't drive me to the depot. He drove me to an industrial estate and had me touch him and masterbate him in his car. I was terrified and crying. He told me he would kill me if i didn't stop crying. He tried to get me to felate him but the smell and taste made me gag. So he stopped forcing that on me at least. When it was over he told me to leave the car and drove off. That experience has haunted me all my life. It has ruined relationships and given me nightmares. That was in X circa 1976.,,
"After work I had a couple people back to my place, a mix of boys and girls, about 10 in total. We were having such a fun evening just chilling and drinking, and I got with one of the boys, who was actually quite forceful. But then when we all went to bed he ended up getting into bed with me. I didn’t originally mind and there wasn’t space anywhere else so I allowed it. However, for the whole night he kept trying to have sex w me, but I said no every time, eventually he gave up and I went to sleep. But I woke up early morning to find him inside me, I felt like I couldn’t do anything so I just laid there and let him do whatever he wanted. Everytime I saw him out after this he would always shout to people how he had had sex with me. I never realised how bad this was until now, but have also realised how much this has affected my current relationship",,
When I was at this school I was sexually assaulted on my occasions and this school refused to call the police or provide any help because it wasn’t on CCTV when the assault had taken place in a classroom without CCTV. I had gone to them twice on two different occasions where this had occurred and they would not help at all and would claim that I was making it up and since then I’ve been traumatised and have been unable to resolve the situation.,,
"It was 1980, I was 13, and a girl and her two (female) friends kept teasing and embarrassing me at school. I'm male, straight, mildly autistic (though I didn't know that then) and found both girls and social situations fairly incomprehensible. The aim of this teasing seemed to be that one of the friends wanted to go out with me, so I accepted because I didn't get many dates. We had a fairly awkward and uncomfortable date in the city, because I didn't really know how to talk to her. Then afterwards at school the teasing intensified and eventually I realised it had been a set-up by the ringleader to belittle me. Why, I have no idea. It severely damaged my self-esteem for a long time and I still don't trust anyone of senior school age. Four years ago there was a school reunion which I would have liked to attend, but I knew the ringleader was going to be there and I couldn't bring myself to go.",,
"I went to a nightclub in my first year of uni and it was a promotion night, so super busy, to the point that it was difficult to get served and hard to move. I was constantly being pinched on the bum, but it was so busy that when I turned around, it was impossible to see who it was. I lost count of the number of times I had been groped without my permission/consent and turned to the people I had come on the night out with, a few boys from my halls. I confided in them and was visibly annoyed and upset. They said they'd take me back to halls but what did I expect when I went out wearing a fitted black dress.",,
"I was raped by a guy in my year at school, he wasn’t out of the closet, and used to LOVE to make gay jokes. Ironic isn’t it? Raped me at a party in a locked toilet",,
"At the beginning of [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I was visiting the doctors about my mental health as I did not want to be here. One night walking to my appointment I was feeling extremely suicidal and cried all the way there. As I left the appointment, I got to the traffic lights. The car at the very front that stopped was full of older guys that I didn’t know (I was 17 at the time) and they were beeping, laughing and pointing at me despite the fact I was visibly scared and crying my eyes out. It felt like the beeping never stopped - you’d of thought I would have gotten the message the first time. They just kept on doing it. This was something that made me even more vigilant in leaving the house as I struggle with separation anxiety immensely. In that moment I was already extremely vulnerable, and afterwards when I was telling my friends what happened I felt overwhelmed with feelings of guilt almost as if what I experienced wasn’t a big deal, even though every single one of my friends has had an experience similar to mine with a group of boys in cars stopping to do whatever to them. Often I feel as though my story has no weight to it when I hear others share theirs, but the more I think about it the more it becomes clear that they all have had the potential to grow into something bigger. That is the problem. It may not seem like a big deal, but chances are if you are questioning whether it is or not then it probably is.",,
"In class he’d put his hands on me, all the time. It was absolutely disgusting. When I would ask three teacher if I could move seats he’d ask why. But I was always afraid of how much problems I can cause. My family and I don’t have money to spare so it want somethingI could just choose to do. I wish I would have spoken up about it though.",,
"After inviting a date back, we became intimate. I explained to him how I do not ever consent to sex without a condom and he took it as a challenge, insisting by the end of the night we would have sex without a condom. I elaborated on my point and even showed him the expensive silk touch condoms I had bought to avoid conversations such as these. He agreed with me then started fingering me. Before I could do anything he forced himself into me unprotected. Holding me down he gloated his victory. He started to do the same thing to my bum, with me saying absolutely no way (having had a bad experience before), and before I knew it he has his fingers inside me shortly followed by his penis.",,
"Always getting sent nudes, not asking for them and men always staring at my boobs cause they are big.",,
"I was bullied for 4 years at high school with the teachers doing absolutely nothing to stop it and it got to the point where it was happening even in the classroom and wasn’t hidden from sight, yet nothing. My mother took it up with the school and had meetings with the teachers and still nothing was done. In the end my mother wanted me to change school and I was adamant I was not giving in and stayed until my high school exams. I moved to another city soon after that as I didn’t want to be reminded of the place or bump into the abusers for the rest of my life.",,
I was friends with a lot of the popular older kids at my school and we went to a lot of parties together there was a particular guy the was interested in me and multiple time would try to hook up with me at the most recent party there a video of him spiking my drink them carrying me up stairs well I’m screaming “stop no put me down let me go”,,
"in school, this boy i was friends with was saying how like ‘oh, i’m gonna touch you’ and i just played it off as joking but i kept saying no don’t do that please and then he actually did it, he touched my private area and i stood up and yelled at him and my teachers came in and stared at me until i sat down and probably just thought that i was fooling around with a friend. although i don’t know if this counts as SA, i still think about it till this day.",,
i got abused and mental abused by my church and it hurts me to see them not doing anything about it,,
"It’s not something I talk about ever really but this seems like a suitable place. I was 14 on holiday, I was kissing a guy in a club and ended up outside with him, he convinced me to go down an alleyway with him, (when I look back, it makes me so angry how naive I was at the time), he started kissing me and got a bit more aggressive and the next thing I realised was that I was then on the floor with him on top of me, I didn’t say no ever and still to this day I don’t know why, I imagine it was the fear and also the confusion, I tried to push him but he was so heavy so I just lay there until it was over, the pain was horrific but I was too scared to move and too in shock to scream. He then just got up and left and I continued my night like nothing had happened. The next 3 years of my life turned to shit, I suffered from depression and bulimia and my relationship with my mum really deteriorated (she didn’t know what had happened). I told my mum vaguely when I was 16 but I couldn’t continue with the conversation and she just reassured me that she was there for me when I was ready. So I was then 18 when I fully spoke to her about it. When I went to uni I told 2 very close friends of mine, because I had a few panic attacks, they were so amazing to me. I wish everyone in my life knew without me having to tell them because I sometimes think that would make it easier when certain topics come up and I sit in the corner squirmy waiting for it to move on, but telling people is so hard because it’s not the type of thing that just pops into conversation. When I see posts of girls talking about their experiences I think it’s so incredible how brave they are and I just wish I could do the same. Still now 8 years on it does effect my life, but I am now in control again and in a very happy place.",,
I feel uncomfortable at school knowing that boys constantly stare at my body. (private areas such as bum and boobs) and then proceed to make unnecessary and some what ‘rude ‘ comments such as “wow your tits are so big” and “your a*se is rate big jeez” and some of the boys will go around grabbing your bum and boobs. I may only be 13 but still realise how wrong this is. Everytime this happens I just have to laugh it out because I feel so embarrassed and don’t know how to react. I also don’t think I should say anything to staff and school because I don’t want to be called a snitch.,,
People have always made weird comments about my body. Especially my legs and above. Then people started spreading sexual rumours about me. And things I might've done. There were 3. And people I've never spoken to would keep asking me if they were true. And they were all in the lunch line so I couldn't leave. And then recently. In the lunch line. Some boys were asking me about my ex. And brought up another one of the rumours from months ago. Then they started miming me getting fingered. And I couldn't leave because I was in the line and they were surrounding me. Making sexual jokes about me and miming that more. I ended up joking my way through until I could leave with my food. but I'm still really uncomfortable.,,
"I don’t know how to word this because I’m constantly in denial that it counts as sexual assault. One of my male friends facetimes me one night which is unusual and began wanking on camera. I obviously left the facetime but he called me back and told me he would OD if I didn’t stay on (I had had previous chats with him about his mental health which was an all time low) so I felt as if I had to be on. He went on to tell me to make noises to the porn he was watching and forced me to watch the porn which I really wasn’t comfortable with. I had to watch him finish and then he hung up. I remember I cried for hours after the call not just because what I’d seen but because I knew I could never see him the same way again. The next morning he apologised, said he was drunk and begged me not to tell anyone and asked if we could be friends which I just couldn’t. This was months ago and I have only told my closest female friends but I don’t feel as though I could go to anyone in school let alone my friends in his friend group. They would support him if this was ever exposed and many people would hate me due to the group of boys he is in. It also isn’t a typical ‘sexual assault’ story and so I would feel like if anyone found out, no one would think it’s ‘that deep’ and would not take my story seriously. I have to see this boy in most of my classes and my friends that don’t know what he’s done are still best mates with him which is really tough.",,
I was raped in the bathroom by my former best friend,,
I was sexually assaulted by one of my best friends when I was young and I will never forget. I was so scared and it happened alot,,
"An ex partner was in the military, who had an aire of superiroity & confidence, wearing a uniform he enjoyed attention from females. Turns out he is a sexual predator and was prior to meeting me, during our relationship & sadly continues to this day. His tactic is gaslighting, adoration, initially subtle coercion, escalating into rough controlling sex and belittling, then making out because you are boring in bed it forces him to look elsewhere. Not many women enjoy being physically abused sexually and a sad common theme for him is also removal of condoms to ejaculate in women, to control them further. He also enjoys deliberately spreading STD's to women as a further form of control. Many of his victims had been approached by him on facebook, instagram, tinder, bumble, plenty of fish and believe they have met the most charming man amongst all the others. It was the most traumatising experience of my life and haunts me still how abusive he was sexually.",,
"I was only 16 and I was at a party. A guy, a year older than me and on the school rugby team got me alone and forced me to the floor. I said no but after he wouldn’t stop I just lay there and took it... it was horrible. And after it happened, I just told myself this stuff happens. I then got drunk to block out what had happened. I never really registered what had happened as sexual assault. Four years later, I was watching an episode of The Sopranos and there was a violent rape scene. I burst into tears in front of my boyfriend and begged him to turn it off. That was the first incident that I realised I had been a victim of sexual assault and that it was not my fault.",,
"A couple of years ago on my way home from school in my sports kit, a group of boys were stood watching me, making comments and whistling. I ignored them and carried on walking until one of them ran up to me and started groping and touching areas of my body. The other boys stood there and laughed whilst telling him to do more stuff. I was in shock and he didn’t move until I had the strength to kick him off. I ran home whilst they ran after me, still calling me names. I often see these boys around my town. This trauma still haunts me 4 years later…",,
"Reading through all of these testimonies has highlighted how much pain and hurt we cause to others without considering the consequences of our actions. I hurt someone once that I deeply care about and I struggle to look at myself in the mirror knowing what I did. I haven’t been able to bring myself to sit down and talk to them about it but I want them to know how sorry I am through this testimony even though it may seem insignificant. They’re probably reading this and my heart is heavy as I type these words. Healing is not a straightforward process but accounts like this encourage conversation in society regarding these issues, giving us a chance to learn from our mistakes and each other to work towards a better tomorrow.",,
By the time I was in upper sixth around 1 in 3 of my close friends had been raped but we didn’t really know we had. I was raped when I was 17 by my best guy friend at the time after a party when I was very drunk. It was my virginity and I remember coming up with at least three excuses before just saying no several times. I was in so much visible pain and just remember closing my eyes wishing it would be over and forcing myself to relax to make it hurt less. I never spoke to him about it and had to watch as all of my friends continued to be friends with him and the rumours spread round school that we had slept together. I didn’t know how much it had affected me at the time and it took telling my family for me to realise the severity of it and the fact that it was rape. I have been sexually assaulted again at uni and find myself trying to make excuses for men because of a lack of sexual education. In reality men and boys (in school) are placed on such pedal stools and even now in my 20s I think I struggle with the idea of casual sex and the conflict between what I want and want I am performing for men and the male gaze as I still find myself in coercive sexual situations.,,
"I was at my friends birthday party who goes to [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We were all drinking and there were several rooms where people were split up. At one point I needed the bathroom and accidentally walked in on this girl peeing. I immidiately closed the door and apologised. When I went to the toilet, she saw me and came in after me, saying that I wanted to see her pee and kissed me whilst I was sat on the toilet so couldnt move. Later that night I was talking to some boy I had just met at the house but we didnt really get along and I didnt see him until the end of the night. At the end when we had to leave, people took the stairs down to the door because she lived in a flat, but I was drunk and waiting for the lift. He waited with me. In the lift on the way down, he pushed me against the lift wall and kissed me violently, and I remember hearing the sound of the lift buttons because he was trying to make the lift journey last longer. He then took my trousers down and shoved his dick into me. I was so drunk I couldnt even hold my back straight up, so one hand was on my head and neck and the other on my back, going between the lift buttons and my body. I had never had sex before and I only realised I had lost my virginity later that night when I saw blood stains on my pants. I told my friends in the cab home but we were so confused we didnt know what happened. He messaged me the day after that apologising because he said he did not feel comfortable with what had happened as we were both so drunk but I replied asking if he had finished in me and when he said no I blocked him and deleted instagram for years. I told my friend a few days after and she urged me to call him a rapist because she knew, but I just couldnt face it.",,
I was walking home from school and there was this boy and we were friends. and i’m a gay guy and he claimed he was straight but what he did to me i will me never forget,,
"I remember as young as year 6 of primary school, the boys rating girls according to who they ""would or wouldn't do it with"". Clearly none of those children had actually got any sexual experience at that stage (at least I hope not), but it points to a culture where males, from a really really young age, normalise and enjoy the objectification of females. Being put in the ""wouldn't"" category cemented my negative view of myself, so perversely, even though this was the nonsense chat of year 6 boys, it has had a long-lasting effect on my self confidence in that I often still feel undesirable or invisible, over a decade later. Consequently, when I was groped at a party in my late teens (a man put his hand up my skirt), when I was groped on the train also in my teens (I was trapped in my seat and couldn't escape) and when, in my early 20s I was cornered by a shop owner while he tried to coerce me (thankfully another customer came and I ran out) I never told anybody, as I thought nobody would believe me... People would be sceptical - why would a sexual predator bother targeting me? I mention the year 6 trivia because I now work at a company where there is a bit of a public school old boys club culture. I know that they play a similar game of rating female colleagues when they meet at the pub. It's an objectification culture that starts in childhood and never goes away.",,
"When I was 15 I was seeing a boy from [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] who didn't want me to tell anyone about us because he was 'embarrassed'. I was struggling with an eating disorder and when I told him about it he used to squeeze my stomach and tell me how fat I was, and how all my friends were so much thinner than me. He continuously pressured me into having sex with him, and I eventually gave in and let him come over. After we took our clothes off and had been kissing a bit I changed my mind and said I didn't want to do it anymore, but he just fucked me anyway while I lay on my bedroom floor crying and telling him to stop. While he raped me he told me my tits were disgusting and my friends were all so much fitter than me. When he finished he laughed about how much blood there was, and then just left. The whole experience left me feeling so worthless that I felt I had no choice but to stay with him, since I was so disgusting I would never find anyone else, and I felt as though I deserved all the things he did to me. He kept pressuring me into coming over and he would just fuck me on the floor or in a park while saying disgusting things to me, about how I was fat, ugly, disgusting and worthless. The last time I saw him, he took off the condom off mid sex, and when I realised after and got upset he just laughed and said 'haha now you have to get the morning after pill'. That experience was the final straw, and I thankfully decided to block him on everything and never talk to him again. It took me years to come to terms with the fact I had been raped and abused by someone who many of my friends were friends with, and who I had to see for years afterwards at parties and nights out. The experience made me suicidal, and I developed immense anxiety around sex which caused vaginismus. Six years on, I still struggle with my mental health and self esteem, and don't really think I will ever fully recover. It upsets me so much that he probably doesn't ever think about the situation, and I genuinely think that he doesn't think he did anything wrong, since to him I was just an object and a 'slag'. I also feel immensely guilty at the thought he could have gone on to abuse other girls, and that had I realised what was happening and gone to the police at the time I could have maybe saved them from him.",,
"""I went out clubbing with my friends and we were all incredibly drunk. One by one they all left to go home until it was just me and the guy who I was aware liked me. We had got with each other during the night, but I was obscenely drunk. We left the club and low-key passed out on the beach; he wanted to go to the casino where I was sat down just concentrating on not throwing up and praying that no person spoke to me. We went back to his (I live up the road), and it was there that it happened.,I also thought: “is this really what sex should be like? I feel kind of used and not involved”. I was very inexperienced at the time and he was 2 years older than me. I started to move my hips a little to see what would happen where he replied: “You said you didn’t want me to cum inside you. If you want me to, continue doing that” in an angry tone. So I reverted back to lying still. He not once looked me in the eyes, but rather had his eyes shut or just looking at my body. No caring touches, no asking if I was ok or if it felt good. Just him focused on busting one out and then sleeping.,I woke up the next morning with my neck red and purple with hickies that did nothing but bring shame. He complained about the price of the pill and almost didn’t buy it. I felt guilty for getting him to follow up on his word, given I didn’t have much money and he worked full time.,It took me 2 years to realise that this was not consensual. The fact that I lay still just focusing on not throwing up, the literal begging that made me (a person with low self esteem) feel like I had to say yes, as well as the total lack of affection made this a disgusting act of rape. 2 years it took me to realise. It’s also worth noting he was benzoed so barely even remembers it. He’s done similar acts to 5 different girls I know. He subsequently touched/slapped my bum in clubs or even in front of our group whenever he was drunk. He continually gropes girls when drunk, where it’s now like “Oh, sorry, that’s just him” kind of mentality. No more.""",,
A boy in my class stuck his penis on my bottom and humped me and then touched my dick without consent,,
"I was now in year 8. I met up with a boy from the year above for what I thought was just going to be a chat and get to know him. He ended up forcing himself on me, grabbing the back of my neck and kissing me. He then shoved his hands down my jeans and touched my ass. I tried to get him off but he was one of the biggest in his year and I have always been quite petite. Some of the girls in his year saw him kiss me and thought I wanted to get off with him but they couldn’t make out the actual details of me trying to push him off the entire time and try to deflect his overtly sexual comments about how big his dick was or how “hot” my body was “for my age”. This was all very traumatic and extremely triggering. I really felt like it was going to be like my initial sexual assault all over again.",,
"The first time I was catcalled was when I was about 12. I was walking down the street during the day & wearing my school uniform. A guy who was cycling down the road stopped next to me (I was on the pavement, he was on the road next to me) & said to me with a smirk on his face ‘hey gorgeous, where are you headed?’. I kind of froze, because I didn’t know what to do & I didn’t know whether he actually wanted me to tell him where I was going. After a minute or so, he grinned creepily again & then cycled away. He was somewhere between his late 20s and mid 30s in age. When I think about this now, it creeps me out that he definitely knew I was a minor & how easy it would’ve been for him to do something to me physically because there was no one else around.",,
A guy in my class at school used to text me after lessons saying that he got hard watching me working. He also graphically sexted me completely unsolicited and then would completely ignore me around school- when I told people about it they’d just shrug it off as ‘he’s just like that with girls’’,,
"I was sexually assaulted multiple times in the school environment by a fellow pupil throughout my entire time there. The school failed to do anything about this when it was reported to them, multiple times. They almost encouraged it by saying that he was “just jealous” and “just wanted to be my boyfriend” when in reality he had assaulted me and it was never okay. We have both now left the school however he also raped me last year.",,
"When I was 15, I had a friend staying and she knew some boys in the year above at school. My parents were out and so she invited them over with my blessing. I was nervous because I had previously been ‘seeing’ one of them who had cut it off with me after I said I didn’t want to do more than kiss. Anyway, they arrive and I drink quite a lot in a drinking game and suddenly my friend and one of the boys get up and announce they going to get cigarettes. I am left alone with the boy who I did not ‘see’. We end up kissing which I am okay with but then it escalates and he removes my top. Then we go up to the spair room. None of which I have objected to but suddenly I realised I didn’t want this to go further so I say sorry we cannot do this. He then said “ come on, I won’t tell anyone”. I keep saying no I don’t want to but after attempting to get stand up from the bed am pushed back down and I freeze after 2 attempts and realise I cannot easily get out of it. He then had sex with me and I tried to let it be over as quickly as I could. Aftrt I jumped up and I inmedietly called my best friend at the time and asked her to come over because I felt so weird about the whole thing. The other two returned from the shop and they knew something was up. After then discovering that we had ‘had sex’ my friend called me a slut and was angry at me because apparently she liked him. The other boy who I had previously seen, was angry at me that I had slept with his friend and not him . Worst of all my ‘‘best freind’ said it was all my fault and I had to deal with consequences. I was called a slut at school by friends and other boys felt like they could sleep with me too. I internalised these reactions for years and felt it was my fault before realising something was really wrong. He went to my school and I had to see him every day. He then went to the same uni as me and would approach me to talk. I started to develop PTSD symptoms walking around uni and struggled to go iinto campus. I eventually sought out help and am much better now. I still have to see him around my neighbourhood sometimes and I feel like I will never be able to tell the truth because too many people know him and would not believe me.",,
"In sixth form my ex boyfriend orchestrated a photo at a party with all the guys id slept with, acting like it was some weird badge or trophy and that I was a ‘trait’ they all had in common. Complete slut shaming",,
"From the age of 9 to 18 when I left home for university I had a neighbour who terrified me. We lived on a hill in the rural highlands of scotland so it was just us, then him and his family and the next neighbour lived two fields away. This neighbour had caused problems for the people before us and continued to do so when we moved in. Without going into the full extent of all the issues, it was all to do with access to our house which went across his property. One of the main thing I had problems with this though was how much he used to just stand in his conservatory and watch me. He would stand in the garden and watch me which since this was on a hill was terrifying to be looked down on. The hill was a single road and hardly any cars went up there. One day walking home I passed him on the other side of the fence. He started copying my pace walking up hill. I was terrified. Imagine trying to walk away quickly from someone up hill. Eventually when the path ran out on his side of the fence he stopped. But I continued practically running home. I could barely breathe when I got back to my house. I gave a statement to the police. It had become normal for me by that point to give regular statements to the police by then. The police knew us so well they would ask me how I was doing at school. I gave evidence in court when I was 11 when he drove his car at me. Luckily he was fined on that occasion. But he still lived next door. He would film me until eventually he was given an ASBO to prevent him from doing this. We no longer live there and as a family we can laugh about some of things he did now, the more ridiculous things at least but to be honest I don't think I ever got over how much that traumatised me. I'm 26 and I still find men scary sometimes. Theres been once or twice that I have thought I've seen him in a crowd or in a restaurant I was working in and panicked. The relief in knowing it wasn't him was always immense. I still have no idea what happened to the photos he took or the videos. I don't like to think about that too much.",,
"Two boys from this school in my city sexually harassed me and pressured/forced me to send nudes to them. At first I didn’t think much of it and I thought it would make them like me. They swore they wouldn’t screenshot or save it, but they did. They sent it to a group chat of boys where they shared girls nudes from my city. from there those boys saved it and sent it it to separate friends, separate group chats. My other friend experienced the same thing. They are both so popular and loved in my city but people need to hear what they did and ARE STILL DOING to girls. He manipulated my other friend to think that girls just sent him nudes out of the blue and he didn’t ask. He’s manipulative. It’s disgusting and needs to be stopped. Thank you for reading.",,
Students in this school have made sexist and sexual remarks towards me as I did many stuipid things which I regret but when these remarks started the school did very little at the time. Luckily there were a few that wanted to help but most didn't wanna be involved and didn't want to stop the bullying. However this all started from my ex making rumours about me.,,
"From the age 13-16 it was part of the culture of this so-called-elite boarding school that is was acceptable for boys to pull up girls skirts, put their hands up skirts and try undo shirt buttons.,When complained to teaching staff I was told that maybe I should purchase a longer skirt from the school shop as a skirt above the knee was provocative. I was growing at such a fast rate and being a scholarship kid did not have the spare funds to be buying a new skirt every month,Boys used to tease and call me big bird (I was tall and my breasts developed early) and some of the male staff started also. One male member of staff even used to call me “jail bait”,With teachers encouraging this behaviour was it any wonder the boys embraced this culture?",,
"At the time, I would have been around 6/7. My grandparents lived round the corner from me so my mam had said I could walk to their house (I had her phone and my brother left 5 minutes before me) when I got to my nannas house I had to call my mam (house phone) letting her know I had got their safe. However around half way there, a car pulled up to me in a cut. The cut was quite small so ofcourse I stood into the side to let the car pass. However the car stopped where I had walked into the side. The man in the car rolled his window down and had asked me to 'suck my willy'. He was completely naked and has opened his car door. He began walking towards me and obviously at the age of 7 I had no idea how to handle this situation or what was going on. I left as quick ad possible and ran to my grandparents (it was closer than home). As soon as I was there I knew something was up, I felt completely numb and as if I had done something wrong or as though no one could know about this situation. My brother and grandparents could tell something was off. They asked me if something had happened. 'I think *insert street name* is haunted' I told my brother. He asked what I meant and I told him what had happened, he made me tell my nanna who rang my mam to come over. She got there and immediately called the police. I had to give statements but lied about not being able to recognise the man or voice if they had gotten any further with my case. I never wanted to face that man again and quickly became scared to leave the house. I was then made to tell my entire school what had happened in an assembly in order to 'raise awareness on what happened to our poor *insert my name* '. If I had spoke up about what truly happened my assaulter would have been found. To this day this still effects me",,
"I was in year 7, french lesson with my whole form. I was sat next to a boy who tried to touch my bum and boobs, he then proceeded to undo his trouser and have his dick out. He began to wank next to me still trying to touch my boobs and bum. Majority of the class saw what was happening and just laughed, when the teacher realised I was uncomfortable she moved me but didn’t say anything about his behaviour. When class ended everyone saw it as a joke and that he was interested in me. He then proceeded to ask me to be his girlfriend in later weeks. He also did this in several french and Spanish lessons but to a lessor degree. No one told me as a 12 year old that this was wrong and that I was violated as a child. It’s only been recent years in which I’ve realised this was in fact sexual assault. Throughout the whole situation I was uncomfortable but it was deemed ‘normal’ for boys to show interest by smacking bums etc. However I still doubt if I told someone with authority at my school that they would have done anything to help, maybe given him detention. But no explanation as to why you don’t do that or why he made me uncomfortable.",,
I was raped at age 17 by a friend of mine. He invited me to his house and kept asking to make me sleep with him. I kept saying no but he pinned me down. I decided that it would be quicker and easier to just let him do what he wanted than to keep saying no. He didn’t use a condom and until I realised he wasn’t and asked him to use one he just said that it didn’t feel the same as without and kept going.,,
I remember in tutor all the girls had to go on their knees at the back of the classroom to get their skirt length measured. On a daily basis male teachers would tell girls to pull their skirts down and check the length.,,
"when i was i rink around 11/12 i had been testing the waters of my sexuality (i was already in secondary school) and had been dating a couple girls, there was one girl that i was with who was very manipulative. She would tell me all these things she'd done to herself and act like i was the one causing it for not being intimate with her. I once invited her over for a sleepover and because i have a sibling who wanted to join in we stayed in her room, during this sleepover she pinned me down and started kissing me, my sibling had to get her to stop before she went too far. The very next day she tried to persuade me to ditch class and go make out with her in the school toilets.",,
I got my ass slapped unconsensually whilst i was bent over a school desk. There was no action taken by the school and i felt too embarrassed to report it.,,
When i was 13 a guy in my school sent me emails with pictures of his dick and also descriptions of how he looked at my body sexually in my uniform and objectifying me and a detailed description of how he regularly masturbated whilst thinking about me. my school did very little about it. afterwards many boys in my year would joke about it around me as though it was hilarious made me extremely uncomfortable about it for at least a year afterwards. none of the teachers did anything about it when it was brought up by boys in lessons even though many of them knew about it,,
"I was 15 and on a bike ride when a car stopped in front of me, I was a bit confused but not too bothered by it. I continued to cycle and when the car and looked to the car when I saw the driver (male around 35-50) was naked and had his penis in the window. I cycled on weirded out and in disbelief at what I had seen. Then the car drove past. I went on until I reached a corner where the car was stopped again and he was doing the same thing again and wanking. I felt so embarrassed like I was in the wrong and I felt horrified and like he was going to kidnap me. Fortunately he didn’t but I cried all the way home.",,
"I was raped by someone i trusted when i was just 14. He was someone who i felt safe around and thought i could rely on but he ended up taking my virginity away without my consent. He was two years older than me as well. I wasn’t wearing anything revealing and neither of us were under the influence of alcohol or drugs but i still blamed it on myself for many months after and felt embarrassed to tell anyone. But a year later, after i came in terms with it and started sharing my story with my closest friends i really trusted, I realized how much speaking up about this issue and sharing your stories actually helps you and people around you who might have had the same experience. I was reassured that it was no ones fault apart from the boy’s who thought it was okay to take advantage of me, knowing that i couldn’t defend myself and realizing this has helped me so much. So for anyone who has gone through similar thing, please know that whatever the circumstances were it is never ever your fault and it’s okay to talk to people you trust about it.",,
i was too young. i didn’t even realise what happened to me until much later and it ruined me. what happened to me made me depressed and suicidal and to this day i’ve never told anyone. hearing other people stories has made me so proud of what we have been through and how strong all survivors are. i love you all stay strong.,,
I was inappropriately touched by both teachers and students at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] school and by the time i finally left i had been hurt and scarred to the extent that i had to seek therapy in order to improve my mental state. I was diagnosed with both PTSD and Schizophrenia and the impacts of my time there still effect me to this day. If anyone has had a similar story at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] please reach out and help end this disgusting behaviour that takes place there.,,
During a school trip one of the boys kept rubbing his erection against the girls' bottoms while we were out sightseeing. By the end of the trip we were actively warning each other to keep away from him.,,
"I went on a first date a few years ago. We had a drink and then we ended up going to dinner. I didn't feel particularly interested, and after dinner, I said was going home. He offered to walk some of the way with me, saying it was in the right direction. When we got to the outside of my flat, he asked if he could use my bathroom. I still feel bad that I somehow 'fell for' this (even while knowing on another level that this is probably internalised victim blaming) but in the moment somehow my desire to be polite and people pleasing prevailed and so I said he could use my bathroom. After he used my bathroom, he asked if he could have a drink. Again, I wanted to be polite, and thought what's the harm. I gave him a drink. However, he wouldn't leave. He started trying to kiss me etc, and I told him I was tired and did not want to several times. He didn't stop and eventually I decided that maybe it would be easier not to insist and that it would go faster if I just went along with it. He asked me to give him a hand job and I did, though I was watching the wall, and he actually asked me if I was alright/not enjoying it which seemed bizarre in some ways. I was relieved when he came. But then, I was lying down, and he suddenly sat astride me and took hold of a pillow. He said, I bet you didn't think the date would end this way, and put the pillow over my head. Fortunately, he moved, but I was terrified. I then told him again that I really needed him to leave which he did, but I remained very scared by the incident and felt I was to blame for having allowed a stranger into my home.",,
"When I was 12 I met a boy at a social, we exchanged numbers and started talking, it was innocent at first but gradually he started to talk more sexually. I had never experienced this kind of conversation and tried to stop it by changing the subject multiple times but he kept insisting and saying things like ‘oh so you’re not interested in me then’ if I didn’t respond in the way he wanted me to. Eventually I gave in, and then he started asking for nudes. I wasn’t comfortable with this and said no multiple times, again eventually I gave in and sent a picture in my bra. Immediately I was put in a group chat with him and two girls where they ridiculed me endlessly, one was supposedly his girlfriend. I blocked all of them immediately and burst into tears. I was so scared about what could happen to the picture and threw away the bra I took the picture in. I never thought girls would be complicit in this kind of behaviour but clearly this boy was capable of manipulating all of us.",,
"When I was 15 i went to wireless festival in Finsbury Park with one other female friend. We were in a tent watching an act abs were both drinking. I started to feel light headed and faint, so my friend started pulling me out of the crowd to get out of the tent and get some air. As we were trying to leave the crowd an older man (mid to late 20s) took my sunglasses off my head. I stopped and looked behind me to take my sunglasses back. As I stopped the man out his hand between my legs and pulled me backwards towards him by the genitals. I was wearing a pair of shorts and he got a finger under my shorts and tried to finger me. My friend pulled me back away from the man and we left the tent. I didn’t really think anything of this incident until years later.",,
When I was 14 someone I thought I was my friend drunkenly tried to have sex with me whilst he thought I was asleep at a party. When I woke and protested he told me he’d tell everyone we’d had sex anyway so I might as well. I obviously didn’t. He was true to his word and told everyone we had. A friend who at the time had defended me then turned this into a rumour that we’d had a threesome. For two years I couldn’t walk into a classroom without people talking or jeering about this. It would be talked about in front of teachers and not one of them called the two boys out on this or asked me if it was true/if I was okay. It was the most isolating two years of my life. At one point a teacher even joined in the jeers.,,
"I was sexually assaulted by my ethics teacher during my final year at school, but there had been a 2 year build up to it. He would frequently bring up topics such as incest, would stand too close for comfort and one time expressed his preference in girls (and described me). The assault happened at an after school event where he publicly grabbed me very tightly by the arm, pulled me right up to his face and said ‘you look nice tonight.’ This is 'low level assault' but the worst experience came from the school. Despite me reporting this to the school child protection officer, this teacher was allowed to keep teaching me because ‘they couldn’t find anyone else’ and I was told that it would ‘disrupt other student’s study too much.’ The school had had issues only a few years earlier regarding another inappropriate teacher which damaged their reputation. They did not want parents and the local press to know that they had employed yet another inappropriate teacher. This teacher found out I reported him. I was so vulnerable and could not focus his class anymore. I failed my A level in his topic. On the last day of the school year, this teacher announced that he had ‘chosen to leave’ and was moving on to a boys school in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. A year later, it hit the press that he was arrested for sexual assault (an assault that had happened years before). My old school had issued a statement categorically stating that nothing had happened at the school. It highlights the school actively chose to put their reputation over their students.",,
I went to a party at 14 and my friends brother had his pals round too and they mingled with us occasionally. One cornered me in a bathroom and raped me. I was 14 and he was 18+. I still don’t know anything about him. I am now 20 making him 24+. Since talking about it more my friends have told me their experiences and every single person i’ve talked to has had some experience of assault or at the very least catcalling from a young age.,,
"A boy I thought was my friend kissed me without my consent. I didn’t want to lose my friends or make him uncomfortable so I told him to stop but never made a big deal out of it. But he began following me and making sexual comments and sending sexual messages constantly. As we shared an extended friend group I couldn’t spend time with my friends without him coming up and standing right next to me, then trying to walk me home. Every time he saw me talking to a man he’d say I was acting slutty. It only stopped when he started doing the exact same thing to another girl.",,
My older sister hosted a party at our house when I was 13. An 18 year old Westminster boy got with me. He told me not to tell anyone because he had a girlfriend. I blamed myself until I turned 18 myself and realised just how fucked up it had been. This school breeds entitlement - including entitlement to women’s bodies. Sickening.,,
"Someone I sat next to would always put their hand on my thigh during lessons and it made me so uncomfortable, my teachers saw but never did anything.",,
"I was drunk on a night out and a boy asked me to go home together. I agreed and we went back to mine and were doing stuff. I asked him to put a condom on before we had sex and he said it was too late and proceeded to have sex with me anyway. I didn’t really know what to do and was quite drunk so went along with it. He asked me for head which I did but when i stopped he repeatedly pushed my head down even after I got up and said I didn’t want to. He kept turning me over to try and do anal without asking, and I kept saying I didn’t want to do that but he kept trying anyway and was holding me down. When I pushed him and got up he said ‘what did I expect him to do with an ass like that’. I said I’d only expected normal sex and he said fine, continued to have sex with me and continued to try and turn me over. I pretended to fall asleep until he stopped touching me. The next day I didn’t really understand how bad it was until I explained to my friend and started crying about how pressured and unsafe I’d felt and like my saying ‘no’ meant nothing. I never reported it because I felt like having originally said yes to sex, not forcing him to leave and coercion into continuing to have sex would mean no-one would believe me or take me seriously. Months later I told a mutual friend about what had happened and he laughed and simply said ‘oh yeah he doesn’t like condoms and he’s obsessed with anal’ as if it didn’t matter. I don’t think I’m the first or last person he’ll have done this too and not reporting it makes me feel responsible and guilty for other women but I also know speaking up would have led to me being guilted for being too drunk, dressing a certain way, trying to ruin his life, as if his behaviour could ever be my fault.",,
A boy at my school used to coerce me into sending him nudes regularly. he was in my form so i saw him every day. he used to walk behind me when i went up stairs and message me with detailed descriptions of my underwear.,,
"A guy sexually assaulted/raped me on school grounds, during school hours when I was 15. The school knew and contacted the police etc. They then told me that I was barred from discussing the incident with my friends as ‘it may reflect badly on the boy in question’ they also punished me by suspending me and eventually expelling me in the run up to my GCSEs. I was allowed to take the exams but had to sit them in a seperate room and had be escorted by a teacher everywhere on-site. The boy was allowed to sit his exams as usual and has been allowed to return to the school. On top of the actions by the school I was openly labelled as a liar or a slag by many of the students AND teachers.",,
I was raped and molested for 4 years by a family friends kid and he was transferred to my school a couple years back. Ever since then he would taunt me and tell his friends and they would laugh. My family called me bad names when I told them and they didn’t believe me.,,
Girls constantly grope my bum but I try to ignore it because I’m a guy and should just enjoy it right??,,
"In year 9 I went to a party and got severely blackout drunk for the first time. I don’t remember anything clearly from the night after the point of having a few shots. The day after, I was told that I had gotten off with an older boy, which I had a vague recollection of. I don’t even remember meeting the boy, let alone did I have the ability to consent. I still don’t know if anything else happened that night past kissing.",,
[school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] is known for being archaic in their treatment of consent and sexual harassment/assault. The younger years would walk around shouting at and even grabbing the upper and lower sixth girls. Before even joining the school I’d had boys calling me a slut and a slag on the street as I walked home.,,
"I'm in P7 in a school and boys in my class are constantly calling girls sluts,whores and body shaming people. A girl in my class got sent nudes by her 11 year old boyfriend and got broken up with and shamed for not sending them back.",,
"I was sexually assaulted on a night out with 2 of my friends, it happened inside the nightclub and I left to go home alone almost immediately after. I contacted the police and they opened an investigation into the assault. Unfortunately the assault happened in one of 3 CCTV ‘blind spots’ and the only evidence they had was seeing us enter and then exit that blind spot and then me leaving immediately after. I gave my statement and so did others involved, the man who assaulted me was arrested and then bailed out. One of my friends who was on the night out with me lied in her statement to protect the man who assaulted me. He’s free, out of prison and can now go on to assault anyone and I could see him at any time because she chose to protect him over me.",,
"This isn’t the only time I’ve been assaulted but it’s the worst and the one I blamed myself for the longest ...After I had just left school, I was on a night out with some friends. I got in a taxi with a couple of guys I met in the smoking area and went back to their house. I felt pressured already. They rolled a joint and watched me smoke it. I didn’t feel safe, I couldn’t move my body properly. I tried to leave and they wouldn’t let me, they tried to kiss me, they locked the door. I managed to force my way out on to the street. They shouted abuse after me. I had no idea where I was, I was too ashamed to call my parents so I called the police. The police were both men, they humiliated me and shamed me for what had happened, told me they weren’t a taxi service for irresponsible teenagers. They left me on the side of the street in a foreign city, throwing up and crying. I eventually got picked up by a taxi driver who drove me home, free of charge, gave me water and made sure I was safe.",,
"It was a pe revision class when a boy and his best friend moved to either side of me while i was doing my work. One boy got particularly close to me,, starting with him grabbing my boob from the side to putting his hand up my shirt and squeezing my arse. I felt as if couldn’t do anything and his friend wouldn't do anything because ‘its banter’. He then messaged me that night saying how much he enjoyed it and that we should do it again,, i quickly shut him down but he was very persistent. I also happen to play rugby at school as well along with the 2 boys,, they both have said him they really enjoy me going so they can stare at my bum and its an excuse for them to touch me.",,
"I think it’s pretty normal that girls at gigs and festivals get their bums grabbed too often and the fact it is normal is disgusting. Every single gig I’ve been to it’s happened but one time it was worse. I was in a mosh pit and obviously you don’t know who’s around you but it was prominently boys. I first felt someone try to put their hand down the back of my trousers but thought it was just an accident. Then what I can assume was the same hand went down the front of my trousers and knickers and grabbed by vagina. I immediately went into my first panic attack (I was 16) and felt so angry, disrespected but also physically hurt. My friend had also had a boy put their hand under her top and grab her boobs the same night. She urged me to report it to [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] but obviously we had no idea who the boys were so little could’ve been done. The next gig I went to after, I had a panic attack again deep in the crowds as it brought back many horrible flash backs.",,
"i’ve been the victim of a guy who would make sexual remarks to me every day and pretend to jack off, i’ve told only my three closets friends, i am scared to speak out about this.",,
"My main experience was my boyfriend of only a few months recording us making out and it being sent around to other people which led me to being labelled as a slut which doesn’t even make sense. I was walking along the corridor and a guy decided to put his hand up my skirt and grab my ass, I was touched and kissed without consent on multiple occasions during school hours which was frustrating because i felt pressured to not make a big deal about it. Another time I had a boy I barely knew grab me round my neck in the corridor and ask if I liked it. As well as all this the types of jokes about rape and sexual assault I heard were awful and upsetting. Something needs to change.",,
I was told by a popular guy in my year that if I didn’t send him nudes then he was going to tell everyone else in my year that I had anyway and create some (he takes graphics) and use them as revenge porn. He continues to do this.,,
Catcalled and almost raped multiple times.,,
when i was 13 i was in a new relationship with my bf at the time and nobody taught me about consent and he would continuously grope me and touch me up and i felt so uncomfortable and everyone around me just let it happen and one time when we were out and it was just me and him and he forced me onto his lap and held my hips slowly moving them back and forth and i felt so uncomfortable so i tried to move but his grip was to firm so i just let it happen cause if i thought id resisted more something worse would’ve taken place luckily lockdown happened and i managed to break it off with him but it still fucks with my head,,

Honestly if someone had to name any boy I knew at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] had pressured a girl into sexual assault I would not doubt it for a second. It was common place. Girls being pressured into blow jobs at house parties was completely normalised,,
"Sadly this is not a new thing. In [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], in the middle of my first term at [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity], I was raped by one of the first team rugby players. His justification was that I had led him on and was a prick tease so owed him. I was drunk, scared and not strong enough to stop him. Then I discovered he’d got me pregnant. I was too humiliated to tell anyone - not even one person - and had to go through an abortion completely on my own over the Xmas holidays, pretending to my family I was visiting friends. Why was I made to feel such Shame?? Because he made out I deserved it. The one thing I want you to take away from this, it’s NOT your fault. And stay away from most ( not all ) rugby players, it seems to be part of their ‘game’.",,
"When I was 14 I went to the Feathers Ball where I was groped 3 times on the bum in one night by boys who were at least 2 years older than me. I told a friend later that night who just brushed it off, saying that it was fine because it meant they thought I was pretty. It was seen as a normal experience to her but made me super uncomfortable.",,
"It took me literally years to come to terms with the fact that what happened to me was, in fact, rape. He was my best male friend at the time, we texted every day, went for late night drives, used to pick each other up milkshakes when the other was having a bad day, would be each other's taxi, I knew his little sister and helped her with school work. I had always known that he had found me attractive (that's how we met), but I had been transparent from Day 1 that this was not reciprocated and we should remain as friends. Everything up until ""that day"" had not given me any reason to not trust him. The day in question, I had found out my boyfriend at the time had cheated on me. I was so upset. So, my friend, wanting to cheer me up, said we could go the pub and talk it out and have a few drinks. So I went along, we shared a bottle of wine and got some chips (nothing unusual), and then, as some nights do, it ended up being quite drunken. What I remember of the incident is literal flash moments, like you see in a film, not enough for me to definitively know what happened to me. I remember being naked, I remember him being naked and turning me over. I remember him begging me not to leave. When I say remember, I literally have flashbacks of a couple of seconds before the memory fades away again. I cannot piece together the night at all. I do not remember how I got naked, what happened once I was naked, or how I got home. I was so drunk and for so long so ashamed because I truly believed it was my fault for allowing this to happen to me, allowing my inhibitions to leave me, and allowing myself to 'lead him on' when I was drunk. The only way I knew we had had sex was because the next day he had told me, saying he felt really hungover. I said I couldn't remember the event at all, and he said 'good, because it wasn't my best performance lol'. Those words will never leave me. There was not an ounce of fear or remorse in him, and to say 'good' that I couldn't remember literally made me feel sick. Needless to say, the friendship ended pretty quickly. I felt so guilty that my response to my boyfriend cheating was to do the same thing. But the issue is, I literally cannot remember it. It took years for me to come to terms with the fact that BECAUSE I could not remember, I could NOT consent. Any good friend would not have gotten me so drunk that they could sleep with me without me protesting, when they knew my sober self would never even entertain the idea, even if I were single. To this day I have never received an apology, never told my family nor the police. Cutting him out of my life was one of the best things I ever did because I could not see his face nor his name pop up on my phone without feeling tears burning in my eyes, without wanting to run away. I confessed this incident to a friend 6 months ago, it was the first time I'd ever said it out loud. It took me four years to tell someone that wasn't a therapist. It took me four years to stop blaming myself. I will never ever forget it, and I will never ever forgive him. I wish I'd have acted sooner. Part of me truly believes part of the reason I didn't act sooner is because drunken one night stands are so normalised, blacking out drunk is so normalised in university drinking culture, and I was truly manipulated into thinking he was still a good friend to me. Even writing it out now sounds so silly.",,
"im 13 years old, i had been in the school for barely 4 months, he was so horrible to me when i first joined, but then he slowly got nicer, he then messaged me one day asking for sex and nudes, i kept refusing but he carried on begging, he would constantly remind me im boring and if he didn’t get what he wanted he’d be horrible to me, i never gave him what he begged for but he was being very detailed, he’d ask to finger me whilst he came in my mouth and i “played” with him back, he told me exactly how it would happen, he’d already planned it out, he also sent me nudes, and videos of him doing stuff to himself, he finally gave up asking and then was horrible to me after, commenting about my weight and appearance, he didn’t like that i said no, i know nothing happened more than the messages but who knows what would have happened if that was a real life conversation and not on messages... I was so frightened and i don’t think i’ll ever get over it, i’m only 13 years old i didn’t deserve that.",,
"This boy and I know each other due to our mutuals. my first sexual encounter happened when he asked me to come upstairs for a chat. He then put me against his wall and groped me trying to kiss me. I was 15 and very innocent at the time ( I hadn’t even kissed someone yet). He had always messaged me on and off to meet so I can give him head etc. I also got in a relationship which he knew about and he touched up my thigh and tried to kiss me. He then got triggered when I refused and he said he felt embarrassed that I rejected him. This made me uncomfortable even when talking about it to my boyfriend and friends. Throughout his months of messaging he was with this girl that he was constantly cheating on, he ended up cheating on her with me and many others. I wouldn’t be surprised if he did this to someone else.",,
I was meeting a boy after school. we were linking at the time. we hadn’t kissed yet. i was having doubts cos he seemed like he just wanted to get some. we were walking down an alley and he pushed me against the wall and started kissing me. i didn’t want to at that point and i told him to stop and he said no and that i should be quiet. he then started to finger me. and was trying to push my head down to give him head. i said no. and ran away,,
"I went to a school in central Essex from the late 80s to the mid 90s. It was considered normal to male sexist and sexual comments and jokes, and that went as far as guys touching girls. We were expected to laugh it off, and as part of the ""lad culture"" then it was normal for guys to try it on. IT wasn't limited to school, it was part of the wider culture. You just got used to being touched up all the time, and if you had an issue with it, everyone would see you as the problem. As we were leaving the school, I had a boyfriend who was going to study aboad for a year. I agreed to sleep with him before he went, and then he would stay with me and we'd continue to be a couple when he got back. When the night came - it was a Monday, I remember it well- I decided I didn't want to and said no. He cotninued anyway and forced himself on me. I was scared. This is what girlfriends let their boyfriends do, wasn't it? When he finished, it was like nothing had happened. I felt guilty about making it difficult for him. I guess I still do at some level. It turned out that when he was away, he was writing to me but with lots of other people. He didn't so much as dump me as write to me about his new girlfriend who he'd been with for a while by then. I've never told my girl friends about what he did as I thought they'd blame me for leading him on or not being clear enough with him. They know something happened. I still have nightmares about it. One of them asked me outright recently and I still couldn't say yes. I'm scared of ruining his reputation because he made a mistake but more than 25 years later, it still haunts me."",I used to not think stories like these had a place here. I can’t imagine the pain of being raped or abused, it’s horrendous, and I’m not trying to take away from that. But I’m starting to realise all these things are linked. Linking the men who catcall with the men who abuse is a total distain for women. Culturally, it all needs to change. So now I think it’s worth sharing.",,
I was repeatedly touched on our school bus. No one ever did anything,,
"I was at a friend’s 18th party. Most people were camping in tents in the garden. I got pretty drunk and don’t remember a lot of what happened but when the party was over, my friends and I went out to sleep in our tent. A couple of older guys snuck into our tent in the middle of the night, squeezing themselves into the 4 person tent that already housed 4 girls. I’d spoken to one of the guys earlier in the night so remember thinking “oh this is cool, attention from this older guy”... but I was moving in and out of consciousness and woke to find him fingering me and putting my hands down his pants, and sticking his fingers in my mouth. The friend whose party it was brushed off the incident as ‘something that usually happens at parties’... the following days, my vagina was sore from his fingering and I felt a lot of shame.",,
"I was in a relationship with someone I considered my best friend. For a few month or so everything was pretty normal however he began to become more and more interested in the idea of doing sexual acts. I was also interested however I still wasn’t comfortable and repetitively told him that since it was so early in the relationship. Over text he began to manipulate me through demanding nudes and getting angry and confused when I said no. Then in person he got me into a position where I couldn’t move. I placed my hands over my chest and he would move them saying “don’t do that” before putting his hands wherever he pleased. It was humiliating and confusing as I trusted him and at the time didn’t think too much of it. However looking back I feel utterly violated. Even after this he let me fall asleep on him while I was completely drunk, I was lucky to be surrounded by friends though so nothing was able to go further. I was completely out of control over myself and this ended with me becoming horribly sick from the aftermath of it all. It still bothers me greatly to this day and he is even in a few of my classes. In stressful situations I find my appetite completely goes and I vomit a lot, because of this I hardly ate for a few weeks and lost a considerable amount of weight. I also struggled to express my confusion, I couldn’t understand what was wrong with me and resorted to self harm in an effort to make something of the pain. More over he apologised yet only for forcing me to kiss him, not his abusive and manipulative behaviour. He is now a rebound sex addict and recently told my friend if she didn’t fuck him (after she asked for a break) he would cheat or break up with her. He continues to disgust me and has left me both physically and mentally scared. I don’t hate many people, but I will always hate him",,
I was around 12 my soon to be cousin was my best friend I was openly bi to her and I liked to work out at night so I was in shorts and a sports bra. We laid down and tried to sleep. Next happened was her hands on me. I got up told her it’s was ok because I was scared. This happened throughout the weekend and one time I agreed because I didn’t know what to say.,,
"I have been the victim of sexual assault on more than one occasion. Unfortunately it happened multiple times within the space of a year and during that time i was in a very toxic friendship. On the first occasion I told my friends about what had happened and at first they told me that couldn’t be true because they knew the boy and “he wouldn’t do something like that”. Then they moved on to blaming me saying that if it really happened it was my fault for putting myself in that situation and for wearing certain things (all I was wearing was leggings and a hoodie but apparently leggings are provocative as they are tight on the bum and that means it was my fault). At the time I believed them. They were my bestfriends so I honestly thought it was my fault. After this they made so much effort to get close to the boy who assaulted me and tried to hang out with him and his friends completely ignoring what he had done. There are lots of people in my school who are still friends with him knowing what he did which is hurtful. Luckily I found new friends and when speaking to them about it they were shocked and assured me it wasn’t my fault. However, because of the people I was around it took me over a year in the end to realise it was in fact sexual assault and it was not ok. Because of this i didn’t feel like I could be upset as it had happened such a long time ago and I should have been ‘over it’ by now. I want anyone who has been a victim of anything like this to know it is never ever your fault what has happened because thinking that it is did so much damage to me and that it is ok not to come to terms with it for a long time and when you do your allowed to feel however you feel and that’s ok and if you have trusted people in your life speak to them because support is helpful.",,
I was told by my boyfriends best friend that he would get bored of me if I didn’t have sex with him.,,
"When I was in primary school (age 10/11), our uniform included either a white shirt in the winter/white polo shirt in summer. When the girls started wearing bras the boys thought it was ‘fun’ to try and undo them without us realising. They also thought it was good fun to ping them.",,
"I was at a house party where I only knew a couple of people, towards the end of the night a friend and I had gone to sit down in the living room which was empty as everyone else was in the kitchen. We were tired and waiting for the rest of our friends to get ready to leave. A few moments later some boys came and joined us, one of them sat next to me and we started talking a little. He began to move closer to me so that his leg was touching mine and then he started to run his hand up and down my thigh and trying to grope my vagina through my dress (this was in front of other people too). I kind of froze and felt so uncomfortable, my skin was prickling and I remember thinking “is he actually doing this? Is this actually happening?”, in disbelief and shock. I pushed his hand away and he put is arm around me to be able to grope my breasts, again I shifted away from him and turned to talk to my friend in an effort to get him to leave me alone and in hope that we’d also leave. He continued to rub my thigh so I put my arm across my lap as a kind of blockade so he couldn’t get any further. I remember just not knowing what to do, I don’t know why I didn’t say stop or get off, I just felt so embarrassed and shocked. Luckily, our other friends were ready to leave a few minutes later so I could get out of the situation. On the walk home I told the friend who had been sat next to me what happened and she was very unsympathetic, saying she’d never let anyone do that to her and she would “never let that slide” if he had done it to her. It made me feel even worse and guilty because I’d let it happen to me as I didn’t say stop. I never told anyone else. All I know is that the boy was from [university name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity].",,
"When I was approximately 13, maybe Spring 1983, I think it was spring half-term, 2 male friends from my high school called round my house for me to go and hang out with them, this wasn't unusual, I'd known these 2 for 4 years previously at my junior school. We lived in a London suburb, they asked me to go to a local small field with them, surrounded by houses, this is something the local kids did, so not unusual, yet there was something about their behaviour that seemed odd, and I thought they were trying to trick me, stupidly I still went with them. When I got there, there were two other slightly older boys (15 or 16 yrs) that I knew from the local area, but not well. When we were on the on the field, one of them shouted something like ""get her"" all 4 ran towards me, I ran away, but they caught me and pulled me to the ground, they started to pull at my clothes. I struggled so hard but couldn't get away, I remember looking down at my legs and seeing my 2 school friends holding one leg each. My t-shirt was pulled up, bra up, I'm not sure if they started on my jeans at this point. I stopped struggling as I wasn't getting anywhere, I stayed still and tried to zone out, I think I started crying. They did not pull my jeans off. They seemed to stop soon after I stopped struggling and became visibly upset. They let me go. I got away from them, I shouted at them and walked home. Never forgotten. I wonder if they even remember.",,
"There was a lad in my year that was popular, he was known to touch up girls in our year. I didn't get much attention from boys. I remember one day he had to squeeze behind me, and when he did, he brushed his hand and then his groin against my ass. There was another occasion where he grabbed my boob whilst the class was separated. I felt so violated, I didn't want him to do that, but I had no one to tell. He was known to do this to other girls but the school didn't care because he was POPULAR. This was 5/6 years ago, and as far as I'm aware, he's exactly the same now.",,
"In the 80s I attended [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. I travelled there by train from the age of 10. A man in his 50s (maybe older) groomed me on my journey to school over a period of about 8mths. One day, he turned up at Streatham train station at 3pm, I was waiting for my connecting train. He sat next to me on a bench. He put his arm around me and went for my left breast. Thank God one of my teachers was on an incoming train and intervened. The next day my parents came and spoke to him and told him, very politely, to please not speak to me anymore. I kept getting the same train and he was always there but never spoke to me again, just looked at me with absolute fury every day. I could not understand what I had done wrong.",,
"A year ago I had a one night stand with a guy. During sex he took off the condom without asking me. At the time I didn’t think too much into it. However, after watching I May Destroy You I found out that taking off a condom without consent is a form of rape, it’s called stealthing. It made me think about the multiple times I have had sex with guys and they have been annoyed about wearing a condom and not thought about how drunk I was. It’s crazy how our bodies can be violated and we don’t even notice, because we are so desensitised.",,
"I was sexually assaulted in my first term at uni. After a party we were chilling in a friends room pretty late as a group. Everyone else left as it was a joke that me and him would hook up but I wasn’t feeling it so got up to leave. He held my arm and seemed annoyed that I wouldn’t even kiss him. He shut the door again and pushed me against it then but one hand on my bum and groped my chest while kissing me. I did not reciprocate at all and tried to push him away. He pulled me onto the bed saying relax don’t be so awkward and kept kissing me on top of me. I did not struggle as I thought it would be over soon, I tried to play it off like I was being hard to get by saying ‘never on the first date, that’s all ur getting’ but all I wanted to do was run away as I felt so threatened. Please have some respect for girls, we are very good friends to you if u treat us right.",,
"He was my first ever boyfriend and what I thought was my first love. I was a virgin at the time and he had told me he was too ( which I later found out was a lie). The day it happened we were at a party and he had been pressuring me to give him head for ages. I finally caved and we went up to a bedroom. I gave him head for no longer than two minutes. After that I was thrown onto the bed and he pulled down my trousers. When I realised what he was trying to do I told him to stop. He didn’t. As much as I could’ve pushed him or screamed or done something more, in the moment, I was frozen. I felt like nothing. Like an object created for someone else’s pleasure. That feeling of nothingness and emptiness comes back every time I think of it. I never held it against him. We never had a proper conversation about it. But over 2 years later I still feel physically sick thinking about it.",,
In school (mainly boys) will harass the girls about sensitive topics and talk about extremely sexual comments in class and despite students going to teachers we are just told they are joking. Teachers have openly admitted that by rolling our skirts we are asking for it and openly allowing ourselves to be sexualised by male staff. Teachers also said to have longer skirts because people look up when walking up the stairs as well as telling the girls it’s inappropriate to man spread and should sit with their legs shut.,,
it is just all a big blur i was talking to this boy at a party and then two other boys come and grab both of my arms and pull me into this dark room and there was not one part of my body left untouched (fully clothed) there were about 7 boys in that room that i thought i knew and trusted since primary school but i guess not anymore,,
One day in school I was walking past a group of boys and one of them said “damn for a white girl you have a big ass” then another day I had went up to talk to the teacher and him and his friends started talking about my butt.,,
"When I was in year 10 my friend at the time got hold of a half nude video of me, the next day when I came into school he had spread it around the school and many of the boys were calling me a slut, other horrific names and making fun of me. After that I got a few unsolicited nude pictures from boys because many of them assumed I was ‘easy’. I was too afraid to tell any of the teachers because they hadn’t done anything in past situations like this to really help.",,
"after i got sexually assaulted at my school by this boy who grabbed my ass for atleast 10 seconds, our year head claimed it’s just “boy banter” and forced me to accept his apology",,
I went on holiday with my boyfriends family for a week and everyday i was sexually harrased by his father who had previously never done this. It was a traumatic experience in which i couldnt escape all week and i still have nightmares 6 months after.,,
I was at a party in year 9 (aged 13) and this boy kept coming up to me and telling me to kiss him. I repeatedly said no and tried to get away from him. Him and his friends kept laughing and he kept on telling me to kiss him. At one point I was sitting on a sofa and he came and sat on my lap and I told him to get off me. He then said he knew I wanted it and started grabbing my boob. All of his friends were watching and laughing. I felt so uncomfortable and I managed to push him off of me and then he called me a prude and a whore and said I should be grateful that he wanted to get with me. I went straight home. The next week at school I heard him boasting to his friends about how he managed to ‘grab the biggest tits in the year group’. I still haven’t told anyone about this.,,
A boy i was close friends with kept harassing me over text to have sex with him at a party we were both going to for weeks beforehand. i ignored all the messages because i was scared. at the party i was very drunk and we gw which i was fine with. next thing i knew i was upstairs in a bedroom with him alone and he was forcefully trying to undress me and i struggled and refused. he then pulled out his dick and put it in my face telling me to suck him off i was very scared so i didnt say a word and i complied. the next day i had people i barely knew asking telling me he told everyone i got down on him. people saying i give bjs for a fiver. i tried to confront him at another party but he just ignored me and walked away. he has me blocked on everything and a lot of my friends are close with him,,
I was with a guy I had know for a while and trusted. I had previously done stuff with this guy. but i had a boyfriend. Then one day we were out and went to a quite spot somewhere. We talked for a while and then he started to get handsy and saying that I wanted to have sex with him even though I didn't and I had a boyfriend which I cared about. I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave. I was pulled back by him while trying to get out of the situation repeatedly telling him NO a lot. He was stronger than me and I couldn't escape. I was raped. But I couldn't help thinking it was my fault the entire time as I should've screamed or should've tried to keep resisting. It felt like I was giving in but I realize now that I was not in the wrong. Most of the time women in this situation are felt to think its their fault and it really not,,
I was sexually assaulted at my school. I have had many experiences involving sexual harassment the whole time I’ve been there and reporting it doesn’t get you anywhere. I still decided to report this sexual assault. As I expected the result of the investigation was in the boys favour and the school had not followed any protocol in dealing with it. I also found out that my so called friends didn’t tell the truth when they were spoken to by the staff as they didn’t want to go against the boy because of who he is. When I confronted them they told be I had been rude to them when in fact I had just distanced myself because of their lack of support through the whole event. I took it to the police and he denied it as expected and the police are still trying to do what they can. I can’t let go of it and my friends continue to let me down over it even posting pictures to social media with the perpetrator. It makes me sick yet i can’t bring it up because I look like the one causing trouble. I wish I was brave enough to put the school because they really deserve to be known for always going in the boys favour whenever these incidents are reported,,
"4 boys in a dorm room undressed me and started kissing and touching me all over aged 12. I have a mental block after that. I was a very vulnerable child which the school knew about, but they had no safeguarding policies to speak of back then- even though it was a boarding school. I had to walk round school with everyone knowing, yet no one had protected me or checked what any of the boys were doing. We were all left unmonitored. I tried to kill myself on numerous occasions as this compounded the other types of horrific treatment at the school.",,
I had already had sex with my boyfriend 3 times that day and it had been so painful. He wanted to have sex again and I didn’t feel able to say no because I was so worried about what he might think or do if I said no. It was so painful I was crying into a pillow and it left me in pain whenever i sat down for the next few days. It was such a horrible experience all because I didn’t feel able to tell him I didn’t want to sleep with him. Girls needs are just as important as boys: if you are in pain stop. No one should go through that. I still get scared that he will what sex when I don’t again as this was not a one off occurrence.,,
"I was,11, he touched my thigh and my vagina",,
"I was slut shamed at my school around Christmas for wearing a backless playsuit. I had just turned 18 and I was so excited to be an adult thinking it would open doors for me about being taken more seriously and having agency over myself.I could see teachers whispering about me when I walked into the dining hall but I ignored it and was happy to be with my friends and getting lots of compliments on how I looked. Finally they sent a female teacher over to me who told me that I was dressed in a way that was too provocative for the male staff and the male pupils - this was in front of all my friends and lots of random people in the dining hall where half the school was there. I was forced to go back to house and change otherwise I was told I would not be able to participate in anything else that evening, just because of what I was wearing. Obviously humiliated, I went back and changed not before crying all the walk back and for about 10 minutes whilst I was in my room because I felt such a strong mixture of shame, embarrassment and anger at being viewed as a “slut” by the people in loco parentis of me. I was already bullied and slut shamed by teachers and pupils alike about my sexuality and this reenforced to everyone around me that I was a dirty, slut that needed to be hidden away.",,
When I was 12 years old a friend of mine who was a year older than myself introduce me to a man in his 40's . He was a football fan and invited me to football matches and we would visit the pub afterwards . He would buy me chips and was very nice towards me . He had a snooker table at his home and would invite me round to play snooker and I would have a Bottle of bear. This when on for about three months. I was invited around to play snooker again this time he closed the curtains which he had never done telling me the sun was bright. He brought me a bottle of bear and we started playing snooker . A short while later I felt really very sleepy . He said rest on the sofa. I woke up and he was on top of me . My trousers and pants had been taken off and his penis was in my anus and his hand was on my penis. I said no and attempted to move but his arms were holding my shoulders down . His face was angry I fell asleep again. I woke up I was dressed. He acted normally. I left and he had no interest in seeing me after that . I don't think I really realized what had happened. I was a addict for thirty years after that assault as well as being diagnosed with PTSD and a eating disorder.,,
Police officers were brought into our school for an assembly to let us know that girls were being assaulted after school because our skirts were too short and that we would have to find and that we should find an alternative route home. A male officer spoke for majority of the speech telling us that we were the problem not the pedophiles that sexualise young girls.,,
"A boy took a photo of me giving him a blowjob without my permission, I don’t know who has seen the photo and couldn’t say anything about it.",,
"When I was 12 years old I was walking to the bus stop from my school. As I came down the pavement with a friend, we reached a group of much older students (in about sixth form) from another school. The road beside us was very busy with cars driving past quickly every few seconds meaning it wasn’t possible to walk in the road to avoid the group. My friend and I walked through, I went ahead and we were separated by a couple of paces. I was nearly clear of the group when I boy much older than me (probably about 17/18 years old) physically blocked my path. He stood in front of me, using his arms to stop me from walking. His hand reached out and grabbed my chest. I violently pushed him away and my friend and I quickly walked away. He and his friends laughed the whole time.",,
"I dated a boy who was a year above me, we were only together for a little while. He sent me a video of him m*sturbating unexpectedly which made me very uncomfortable. He didn't do this again after I had to repeatedly tell him that I didn't like it. After we broke up he made comments on my body saying my bum looked nice when he was with a friend and we were on FaceTime. He then groped me the first time I was alone with him after our break up. He later denied everything and made me out to be a slut.",,
"Mine wasn’t at school so I don’t know it it’s relevant! I was raped by two older men on holiday, they took me out drinking knowing I was under age, spiked me and took me back to their room and raped me twice. They then came and sat by my family the next day and got me coffee. Their ability to act like nothing happened made me think it was acceptable for years and years, it was even something i laughed about which makes me feel so guilty, I now recognise it as a coping mechanism"",“They gained so much clout from their peers (that entire group) from being vile to girls. I would say it wasn’t a stretch to say that their social clout was largely determined by their attitude towards girls (the more sexist, the more respect they garnered). Soz came here from ——- stories but was an interesting read. With hindsight that entire group of boys were so awful to girls. They would sleep with girls, like u said ‘share’ as they would say, then discard them, and talk shit about them and show their nudes. And if u ever tried to say something against it you were just met with anger and mocking”,*This is called stealthing and it is a legitimate form of rape"",“I was staying on site at my work. My manager and I were in the same accommodation. We ended up alone together one night and were drinking wine. We were flirting but then that turn to him kissing me, and then I know he want to have sex. I repeatedly said ‘no..I can’t’ ‘no...I’m just gunna go to sleep’ ‘we are not having sex’ ‘No honestly I can’t, I don’t want to’. And then with the social pressure of him continuing to try, lying on top of me kissing me… I just felt like I had no choice, have no other word for NO. So we slept together. I felt so embarrassed. I cried in the morning and felt really ashamed and guilty like it was my fault for allowing it to happen just so he would stop pestering me. Having to work with him the next day was horrible. I handed in my notice very shortly after.”,“Yes to this about mixed state schools! A boy in my class would regularly sit next to me in lessons and repeatedly put his hand up my skirt and even go into my knickers without my consent - I felt so uncomfortable but stayed silent because we were in class so felt embarrassed & like I couldn’t react. Spent years of being relentlessly called ‘slags’, bullied for our appearance, groped, sexual stuff we had done was constantly aired in the open - all on a daily basis. U could never escape this culture Bcos u were with them at social events and every fcking day at school. Sitting in lessons with ur abuser..”, “< He didnt mean it in that way! >> i absolutely HATE THIS so much! I remember i went to 2 of my girl friends about something tht happened to me when i was drunk and they literally were both defending the guy saying it was probably me who led him on or tht i mis-remembered the situation and it wasnt a big deal. So for so long i believed i was the one in the wrong“,""I felt extremely pressured to have sex with this boy who was in my wider friendship group. He was incredibly violent in bed also without asking for consent. Think I was one of many girls who felt the same way.",,
A boy in my class reached over my friend and rested his arms on her shoulders. She told him to get off but he then went on to lay his arms over her chest and breasts and asked what was wrong. The teacher saw but nothing was done.,,
"I was out clubbing, in a booth with some friends, who had invited some of their friends along as well, people I thought I knew well and considered to be my friends. I was dancing and he came up to me to greet me, and instead of hugging me and saying hello, he just groped my ass, and when I turned around in shock and asked him to not do that again because it’s disrespectful, he winked at me in a “playful” way and said “you know you liked it” then proceeded to squeeze my bum AGAIN. All whilst holding another girl in his arms.",,
When I was in fifth grade a boy came to The women’s bathroom and stayed in the stall once I walked in the bathroom he walked out the stall and locked me in another stall he touched my Area and laughs once I told him to stop he started laughing and walked out the bathroom,,
"I was in the smoking area of a nightclub in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. As I walked past a man, he groped my bum. I turned around and yelled at him of doing so. He refused to accept that he’d groped me. After going back and forth for a while, he finally accepted that he had, in fact, groped me without my consent. However, he also added, “In future, I wouldn’t pick fights over this. You’re a pretty girl in a night club, it’s bound to happen.”",,
Day after day girls in my year Including me were touched inappropriately and pressured into doing things we weren’t comfortable to do.,,
I was at a halloween party in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and had gotten a bit too drunk. This guy offered to look after me and took me outside. I started to feel really ill and wasn’t fully aware of what was going on and kept feeling like I was on the brink of consciousness so lay down on the floor to sort of just wait it out. This guy took this as an opportunity to start getting with me and touching me up. I wasn’t really aware of what was happening and he kept going until other people came outside and then he left me there on the floor barely conscious.,,
i was assaulted by a boy in the girls bathroom,,
I just want to say a big fuck you to all the men and boys who have sexually assaulted me. At the age of 11 I was sent my first unsolicited dick pic. At the age of 12 I was nearly raped. At the age of 13 I was groped at a party. At the age of 14 my nudes were leaked online. At the age of 15 I was taught that all of that way my fault. At the age of 16 I stopped blaming myself and started to fight. Now at 17 I will never stop fighting for what’s right. I was catcalled just the other day walking home from school and the man tried to follow me so I pretended to be on the phone. I want this to end. I don’t deserve this.,,
"i was raped at a high school party in 9th grade by a guy i didn’t even know, i was severely intoxicated and he pushed himself on me.",,
I was groomed on the internet as a very young child. I didn’t realize until it got too out of hand. I thankfully knew it was wrong and blocked the person and never talked to them again. I wish I could rewind and just never start anything with that person,,
"In year 8 (I was 12) this one boy I sat next to used to creep his hand up my skirt every lesson, further and further each lesson. I was frozen and too terrified to say anything for 4 lessons until I burst out crying to my Mae teacher, who told the school. The school told me that since he hadn’t actually touched my genitals that they wouldn’t do anything about it, not even detention. He carried on doing this to loads of other girls who were too scared to say anything about it.",,
"When I was in year 11, I’d been talking to this boy for a while and he asked me to send him revealing pictures of myself. I’d never done it before but I’d heard from other people that it was quite normal and so I sent them. After I sent them he told me that he’d recently gotten a girlfriend, unknown to me. I was quite upset that he’d asked me to send something and so I said that I was going to tell her because I felt bad. He then told me if I did, he would send my photos around the school and so I kept quiet. A day went by and I suddenly started receiving messages from some guys in my school that they’d been shown my pictures and so I knew it was him. I didn’t know what to do so I confronted him about it and he told me that if I went to the school for help I’d get in trouble for sending them whilst being under 18. I never told anyone other than my friends and I still don’t know how many people saw those pictures.",,
"I was having a bad year at University and had way too much to drink one night. A group of us had come back to our flat and I proceeded to black out. The next thing I was aware of was lying down naked, very distressed saying that I wanted to go to my room, to be told by the guy that we were already in my room. I don’t remember any more but woke up naked the next day with a guy who I thought was a friend. I was physically sore for days afterwards due to the friction of the sex that I was unable to consent to. I tried to speak to the ‘friend’ afterwards about it but he dismissed me. I only realised a few years later that it was rape.",,
I was sexually assaulted by a boy at [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity]. We were hanging out in [name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] and we started to gw and then he forced himself on top of me and kept trying to put his hands down my pants and grabbed my hand and tried to put it down his pants and I kept telling him no and to stop. I got so uncomfortable I eventually pushed him off and got up and walked away and then he got mad at me for leaving him blue balled he proceeded to wank himself off in a children’s playground.,,
"I didn’t think anything of it at the time but after reading some other testimonies I realise just how wrong this was. When I was 15 I was in a reasonably long term relationship with a boy. He said he loved me. He repeatedly used me for sex and persuaded me to do it with him by saying things like “you’re so boring” “fine then I’ll break up with you” “you’re no fun” . I felt so trapped and did whatever he wanted because I loved him. I now realise just how disgusting and toxic that relationship was. I would come home and cry because of what he did to me and when I tried to talk to him about it he would make out like I was doing it to him and call me disgusting and say I was making things up. I specifically remember one day when I was about to come on my period and I told him I wasn’t comfortable doing anything (I had terrible cramps and could barely walk) and he made me feel so guilty that I ended up doing what he wanted, I knew I shouldn’t but I didn’t want him to break up with me for being “boring”. I am now out of the relationship but the experiences that I had will stick with me for life.",,
"When I was 14 a teacher at my school started showing interest in me. He had lots of inappropriate relationships with the students and I used to call him regularly. By the time I was 15 he had left the school and stayed at my house during the summer (he was friends with my older brother). By this time we had talked about having sex. Every night he would come into my room, sometimes drunk, sometimes sober, and talk to me. Sometimes he would just give me a hug, sometimes he would kiss me. Sometimes he would make me touch his penis. It took me over a year to realise the profound effect this had on me and my trust especially with older men. I have spoken to the school and I have spoken to the police. But that doesn’t undo it.",,
"I was 13 or 14 at the time with my first boyfriend. There were certain things I felt pressured to do but went along with anyways. But the one thing I told him was that I would never ever give a bj unless I was married. For weeks he proceeded to pressure me about it saying that “everyone else is doing it” and tell me that boys would talk about things they do with the girls in our year and that it was normal. He made me feel guilt for not doing what he wanted. I eventually caved in. Before the break up I told him I felt like a sex object to him and he said he “couldn’t believe” that I’d think of him like that and I ended up apologising to him for how he made me feel - even though I was right. I didn’t think about it all until a year later and it took me that long to realise that he had wrongfully pressured me. I felt a lot of shame and it still affects me to this day. Luckily I have a few brilliant close friends who I eventually opened up to and they supported me. I still feel that my experience isn’t valid enough to be considered sexual assault because i never had sex with him and he wasn’t violent, just emotionally manipulative.",,
"""I went to his house, i was 14 he was 15. He kept fingering me without asking, it was clear i didn’t feel comfortable and i kept trying to push his hand away. He kept doing it saying it was going to be ok. ,It hurt a lot.""",,
i was threatened to be raped constantly by this one boy.,,
"My ex-boyfriend became gradually more and more emotionally abusive towards me behind closed doors and started to make me feel like I was ‘wasting his time’ or ‘not as cool as he thought I was’ when I didn’t want sex, then hurting me where no-one could see the marks when he got angry and blaming me for his lies. He gaslighted me so much I believed I was the crazy one and he began to chip away and make everyone else believe I was too by putting on a sob story show telling them I was the one hurting him but he loved me so much so he stayed with me. He was so adored by everyone around him because of his charm- simply the fact that he was in a band and branded himself a ‘feminist’ and wore girls clothing etc, that I felt like no-one would believe me. One day I got suspicious of all these young girls he was following and my friend messaged some of them, we found out they were all aged 12 and under and he knew but was messaging all of them trying to meet up. When I confronted him he broke up with me saying ‘I’ll be here for you to talk still anytime, I know this will be hard for you’ then blocked me everywhere. I posted with permission the messages from the girls on my Instagram story and every single person I met through him and even some of my own friends unfollowed me but not him. I know there will never be proof of what he did to me when we were alone but there was literal proof he was a peodophile and people unfollowed me for just exposing it, that was the extent of his manipulation over everyone and his posing behind his ‘mochi pink flower boy’ personality. To this day he is gaining fame from this and I don’t know what lies he told everyone about me. I have complex ptsd and depression as a result and even seeing someone who looks like him now I breakdown",,
Guys have touched me w/o consent and called me things no one should be called,,
"I also know there are some tallies on [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] bathrooms saying will X gw X, and then a separate one saying ‘if she’s drunk enough’, also from my experience there have been multiple times where people (not necessarily the boy involved) have made up false stories about what a girl has done (myself included) sexually with certain people and even if at first people know it’s a joke it gets around to enough people that they accept it as true / the girl has to constantly try to convince people it isn’t",,
"I was 15, it was at a party. I was being repeatedly groped in the mosh pit but couldn’t figure out who it was as every time i turned around it was different people. It just kept happening over and over again, I didn’t know when the groping would stop. I went to different locations of the party area with other people but it just kept happening. I then discovered it were these 3 guys who were all my good friends. Still they’d come hug me around my waist and i pushed one of them away, but they still continued to target me that night. I was then told throughout the few days i was with them, they would talk about the things they would do to me in a different language when i am next to them. I was groped over 10times in the space and time of 15mins by 3guys. And it just kept repeating itself. I felt like i couldn’t tell anyone, ‘you asked for it’ taught me to blame myself for wearing denim shorts and not the guys for repetitively assaulting a 15year old.",,
Idrk if this counts but [date omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] I left school late after sport. I was wearing my PE kit which is a hoody short skort. Walking to the tube station with my friends it was already getting dark but when I got off of my stop it was nearly pitch black. I felt scared as I walked across the platform realising there was a group of much older teenage boys walking towards me laughing. They started whikstlintg and I hurried past them thinking they would leave me alone. They ended up turning around and follow me out the station still cat calling and yelling. I started to run as they weren’t leaving and I was so scared but then they were chasing me. They caught up and started grabbing me on this small hill. They were telling me to settle down and grabbing and groping me. Then one of them started saying he was going to fuck me and started unzipping his trousers. At this point I managed to elbow the one holding me in the face and start sprinting off. I could hear them starting to follow againme some still laughing and whistleing.Again but I managed to make it to a main road and then into the shop. They must have given up as once I left the shop abt 15minutes later they were gone. I was ashamed and felt confused because I hadn’t been raped yet I still felt damaged and the incident still terrifies me. I didn’t tell my family or report it because I was too ashamed. I thought me wearing the short skort in the dark meant it was somehow my fault even tho I knew it wasn’t. My friends tried to get me to report it once I told them but I said there was so point but I think I just felt guilty. I hope if anyone sees this they understand that no matter what your wearing it doesn’t make it okay for anyone to do anything like this to you. It’s not your fault.,,
"When I joined a traditional private school for sixth form, it was a shock to find a highly sexualised atmosphere. One teacher was sleeping with multiple students, another teacher took us to his flat after a party and showed us porn. At one sixth form party at someone’s house, I got drunk and woke up to find an older boy that I didn’t know having sex with me - I was a virgin. This really messed up my self-worth and attitude to sex - I felt stupid, worthless and for a short while was flippant about who I slept with because it “didn’t matter”. On another drunk evening later on, consensual sex turned into gang rape because a group of male friends decided that consent to one meant consent to all. Again, I blamed myself for the alcohol but getting drunk was numbing the self-hatred and I was spiralling. Thankfully I broke the spiral but I remained ashamed for many years and it took a long time to recognise this as rape. It influenced my career path because I wanted to remain private and anonymous in case anyone found out - it was my shame, not their’s.",,
"when i was in year 8 i was 12 at the time, i say next to this boy in my english class he constantly would touch my thighs and even touched my private area i told him to stop, he didn’t it carried on everyday for about a month he constantly spoke about how he was going to have sex with me and touch me",,
Me and my boyfriend at the time had already had sex multiple times one evening. He wanted to do it again and I said yes even though I knew it was going to hurt. It was so painful I had to bite a pillow so hard not to scream and my eyes started welling up. I told him yes and tried not to show how painful it was and it is that I hate. It was so engrained in me that you should never deny a boy sex and you should always do what he wants that I was willing to put myself in that position when I knew I would be in pain for the next few days. Schools need to give girls more confidence to be able to stand up for themselves and not be ashamed about not wanting sex. I’ve never told anyone this because I’m so scared of what people would think.,,
"so everywhere I tried to complain told me to go to the police, so I went to the police and the policeman watered it down and did not take it seriously. I gave up all I was trying to do was alert to the serious stuff that happened at the education place .",,

"After a party I told a friend they could stay over. They kept trying to sleep with me but I kept saying no that I was too tired but really I just didn’t want to. At one point they moved on top of me and started kissing me and fingering me despite me telling them to stop as I was too tired. Finally they let me go to sleep but only for an hour before waking me up and trying on me again. I couldn’t sleep, not in that bed, I’d wake up in it sometimes and throw up just from how nauseating it was to be reminded of it. I didn’t let anything go near my vagina for weeks after that even things like periods were difficult I couldn’t touch down there without feeling sick.",,

I was that drunk he practically had to hold me up as I couldn’t walk on my own. I remember getting into the bedroom, kissing him then taking my dress off. After that I blacked out and woke up laid on the bed with him having sex with me. At one point he straddled my face and shoved his penis into my mouth and thrusted his body into me but I was that drunk still I couldn’t move and didn’t really register what happened . I’m 22 now and it’s only just hit me how bad this situation was.",,
when it was the last day of school these guys on my bus said that since we weren’t allowed to bring our school backpacks on ( bc our principal said that we weren’t allowed to bring them ) that they got a good view of our butts and one of the guys called me thick and hit my butt idk who it was butt they were all laughing so i knew it was one of them.,,

We were disgusted because some of us were even changing our bras for more appropriate ones. He used the excuse ""At my usual school the boy's room is on the right."". When I and 3 other girls reported him we got threatened into silence with the ""permanent"" record threat. (which [school name omitted by EI to preserve anonymity] doesn't have). He would have this same mistake 7 more times in the spam of 3 weeks. With no punishment and he still works there.",,
"A boy had sex with me while I was passed out drunk. I cried when I woke up and found him on top of me, to which he said I was being crazy and that it was a completely normal thing for him to do since we were in a relationship at the time. It took several years after this happened for me to come to terms with the fact that it wasn’t as “normal” as he had argued it was. I never told anyone because I truly believed that I was being “crazy” and overreacting by getting upset.",,
"In year 8/9 in my maths class i was sat next to two boys, they kept telling me how they’d have sex with me asking me what colour my underwear was for the whole lesson, one of the boys got up and started putting his backside in my face asking me if i liked it. I went in the day after and they were laughing about it.",,
I was with my ex boyfriend in a dark seedy bar at a table and an old man came and sat down at the same table as us and when my boyfriend went to the bar to get more drinks the man quckly leaned over the table and kissed me on the lips before I knew what was happening. It was shocking. Also I ended up at some girls house with 2 guys after another night out. She went upstairs with one guy. I wasn't interested in the other guy. I was a bit drunk and he was sitting opposite me on the other settee. I laid down and started dropping off to sleep and I felt him come towards me and say my name and he was about to try and kiss me. I opened my eyes and he ran out of the room. I'm disgusted with these two men and get very angry when I think of them. Plus another time a man and his freind told me they owned a bra factory and squeezed my breast to 'see what size I am.. So many incidents over the years-so many.,,
I lost my virginity to my boyfriend at the time at his house after a party (it was consensual) and the next Monday when I went into school somehow everyone seemed to know. I felt embarrassed and angry that something so private was made so public. I later found out that he was bragging about it to people that he wasn't even friends with. To this day I have never told him how angry I was that he did this.,,
